<RESPDATE>111419
<CONTACT>Steven Budd, Contract Specialist, Phone 2023666688, Email steven.budd@dot.gov
<DESC><p>With this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) seeks to understand how new data sources or data sources that the Department of Transportation (DOT) currently does not have access to can be used to answer the most pressing and persistent surface transportation safety problems. OST is interested in approaches that use new data sources and/or data unavailable to the DOT to gain novel, useable, and actionable insights to improve safety outcomes. OST also views the BAA as a way to explore replicating and scaling the application of new data sources or methodologies across the country; and assess the capability of new data sources by using them to answer specific research questions.</p>
<p>BAA awards will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will consist of developing concept designs that address at least one of the research problem statements described in Section 1.5 of this Announcement. OST will award up to $50,000 for up to six of the strongest and most promising research designs. The second phase will focus on developing and executing the proposed projects and is limited to the first phase awardees only (more information is available in Section 2 of this Announcement). This solicitation is for Phase 1 only.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Presolicitation notice is to allow prospective offerors to review a draft version of the BPA and submit questions. Each prospective offeror e-mailing questions to the Contract Specialist should attempt to state each question in such a way that the offeror would have no objection to OST publishing that precise question (and its answer) in a formal amendment to the BAA, on the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) / beta.sam.gov Opportunities. As such, each prospective offeror should attempt to word each question in such a way that the publication of that question (and its answer) on the GPE would not divulge any information that the prospective offeror considers to be proprietary or confidential.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors should submit their questions to <a href="mailto:steven.budd@dot.gov">steven.budd@dot.gov</a> using the attached "Question Template" by 11:59 PM EST on November 14, 2019. Government responses to questions will be posted at a later date along with a due date for proposals.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Project work consists of the reconstruction of a portion of the federally authorized project to restore the project area to pre-storm conditions. The project will consist of the placement of beach quality material along 1.45 miles coastline as shown on the drawings. The design cross section of the project includes an upper flat berm, lower sloped berm, and foreshore berm. The upper flat berm ties into the existing back berm at elevation +7.5 feet NAVD and extends the berm crest at elevation of +7.5 feet North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD) at the Construction Baseline (CBL) or specified distance from the CBL. The lower sloped berm ties into the berm crest at elevation 7.5 feet NAVD and slopes downward on a 1-foot vertical on 100-feet horizontal (1V:100H) to elevation +6.5 feet NAVD88. The foreshore berm meets sloped berm crest at elevation +6.5 feet NAVD and slopes down to existing grade on a 1V:15H slope. Half-a-foot tolerance above the required is provided for a fill tolerance.<br /><br />The Borrow source for the project is approximately &frac12; mile offshore and 3 miles north of the placement area. Access to and from the borrow area is limited thru designated ingress and egress areas shown on the plans due to extensive offshore hardbottoms. The borrow area has two dredging cuts: Western cut (Section 1) and Eastern Cut (Section 2) where dredging will commence at the eastern cut to 95% of the target depth volume shown on the drawings before proceeding to Western cut. Work also includes endangered species monitoring, screening for rock, vibration controls and monitoring, turtle trawler mobilization/demobilization, and relocation trawling. The dredge shall be load-line Coast Guard Certified.</p>
<p>Magnitude of construction is between $7,300,000.00 and $10,300,000.00.</p>
<p>As stated above, the dredge shall be load-line Coast Guard Certified. The request for proposal will be issued on or about 1 November 2019 and proposals will be due on or about 03 December 2019. The award of the task order will be made on the basis of Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA).

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, on behalf of the Program Executive Office Ammunition (PEO AMMO), is issuing a sources sought announcement in an effort to identify capable sources for the production and delivery of the following: MK76-5 Twin Pack Practice Bomb (NSN 1325-01-071-2560; P/N 2193779), BDU-33 D/B Practice Bomb (NSN 1325-01-054-2906; P/N 7729467-10), and 25 lb Bomb Suspension Lug (NSN 1325-01-236-8604; P/N8631481) for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2020-2024 requirements. "Twin Pack" refers to the two practice bombs that come in one box. The Government anticipates awarding one Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production contract with five one-year ordering periods.
<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION: The MK76-5 Practice Bomb is approximately 24.64" long, has a finished weight of approx. 24.5 lbs and consists of fabricated steel. The bomb has a firing pin assembly, aft body assembly, bomb body, and a center cotter pin. The MK14 lug is required for suspension with the MK76-5 Practice Bomb, and is included in the MK76-5 Practice Bomb TDP. The BDU-33 D/B Practice Bomb is approximately 22.9" long, has a finished weight of approx. 25 lbs and consists of fabricated steel. The bomb has a firing pin assembly, fin assembly, bomb body, and a pin. The 25 lb Bomb Suspension Lug is required for suspension with the BDU-33 D/B Practice Bomb. The Navy is the end user of the MK76-5 Practice Bomb and the Air Force is the end user of the BDU-33 D/B Practice Bomb. Both practice bombs are utilized for pilot training and certification requirements.</p>
<p>CRITICAL PROCESSES/SKILLS: Manufacture of the practice bombs requires skilled welders, machinists and a facility capable of supporting high quality zinc phosphate coating and painting processes. These skills and capabilities are important, but are not unique. Manufacture of the lugs requires critical skills including die manufacturing, forging techniques, heat treatment, machining and plating. Critical capabilities required to produce the lugs include forging equipment capable of maintaining die match, CNC machines, pull test equipment and fixtures. These skills and capabilities are important and unique.</p>
<p>NOTICE: The Technical Data Packages (TDP) associated with the practice bombs and lugs are classified as Distribution D - limited distribution authorized to the Department of Defense (DOD) and US DOD Contractors Only.

Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate in accordance with provisions of DOD Directive 5230.25. Interested vendors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) to gain access to the TDPs (see www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instruction and information). Each individual requiring access to the TDPs must have a FedBizOpps account prior to accessing the TDPs. Access to the TDP will only be granted to those individuals who are listed as the Data Custodian (block 3) on the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Requirement, which was required to be registered within the JCP. The Data Custodian is the sole representative identified to receive export controlled TDP's interested vendors may request access to the TDPs at the following link: https://www.fbo.gov/fedteds/W52P1J18R0143</p>
<p><br />RESPONSES: Interested companies who consider themselves capable of manufacturing the practice bombs and their associated suspension lugs are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government with the following information:<br />a. Provide a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of the facilities, personnel experience, quality system, and past/current relevant manufacturing experience and processes).<br />b.

If so, please state when it was last produced, who the customer was, the production rate under that contract, and the contract number.<br />f. Identify your company's size status for the identified NAICS code in your response along with the following information:<br />1) Company name and address<br />2) Point of contract Name, phone, and email address<br />3) Company Cage Code</p>
<p>This sources sought announcement is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought announcement or otherwise pay for information solicited. Industry responses to this sources sought will not represent binding offers, and the Government cannot accept an industry response to form a binding contract.

Please note, all questions pertaining to this survey will be answered at the discretion of the Government. Please note that any information you submit in response to this questionnaire that is protected by law, will not be released. Any responses to this request for information are subject to the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;&bull;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps)"PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&bull;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&bull;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&bull;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&bull;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&bull;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&bull;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Request for Information is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for proposal, does not constitute a solicitation, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not considered offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. Funds are NOT available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents to this technical description is strictly voluntary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&bull;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondents WILL NOT be notified regarding information obtained related to this Request for Information.

<DESC>The U.S. Army is conducting market research to identify potential sources for the Pump Rack Module (PRM) manufactured to ATPD 2321D along with the supporting hardware and logistics package. The purchase description, ATPD 2321D is attached.
<p><br />DISCLAIMER: This sources sought is for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation or a request for proposal (RFP) and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. The Government will not pay for information solicited. Any information submitted by respondents to this announcement is strictly voluntary.</p>
<p>Currently, the U.S. Army acquires the PRM from DRS Sustainment Systems Inc. (CAGE: 98255). It's the Government's belief that only DRS Sustainment Systems Inc., the manufacturer of the parts, and/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the tested and approved required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components manufactured to ATPD 2312D. However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the PRM system. This information will be used to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Potential sources who propose to manufacture the system that meet ATPD 2321D must either: 1) Demonstrate that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufactured and successfully passed Government Test; or 2) Complete and provide current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics). The submission of a technical data package for review will not impede the award of this requirement, but may qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered. Other potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within the closing date noted in the post.</p>
<p>Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Respondents to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability to provide the above items.</p>
<p>Point of contact for this Sources Sought is Christopher Miklasz, Christopher.j.miklasz.civ@mail.mil or 586-282-6856 and Mike McHale, michael.j.mchale2.civ@mail.mil or 586-282-8027.</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">In February 2019, the Secretary of the Navy directed the establishment of the United States Naval Community College (USNCC). This recommendation was based on the exhaustive Education For Seapower study, which found that the Naval Services were not utilizing fully the talent and intellectual potential of America's enlisted Sailors and Marines. The USNCC will be the primary means for the Naval Services to provide educational opportunities to the entire enlisted workforce to prepare for future challenges. At full operating capability, the USNCC will:</span></p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain capability statements and potential feedback for an upcoming Library of Congress (LOC) requirement. Specifically, the LOC's Law Library requires contractor assistance to classify the portion of the Law Library collection shelved under the "LAW" shelving system into the "Class K" system developed by the Library of Congress between 1967-2003.
<p>Approximately 407,114 volumes remain shelved under "LAW."  The Law Library generally concentrates on material about an individual country.  The country chosen depends upon the language skills of the classifiers. The work requires a knowledge and understanding of the Library of Congress classification schedule, particularly the schedule covering legal material (Class K).  It also requires an understanding of the legal systems of the countries involved and the principles of legal research and legal publication for each country. The work is accomplished by careful attention to the routines involved in analyzing the title in hand in order to assign the proper Library of Congress classification number. Knowledge of the operation of the Library of Congress Integrated Library System is essential.</p>
<p>As an RFI, this is NOT an official solicitation. The LOC is not seeking to obtain proposals or quotes. The Library is seeking simple capability statements from potential offerors as a way to perform supplemental market research. No contract shall be awarded as a result of this RFI. An official solicitation will be forthcoming at a later date. This notice solely constitutes market research. Capability statements are being requested to query the market, but they shall not be considered quotes or proposals.</p>
<p>In addition, the LOC welcomes feedback on the attached statement of work. Offerors are encouraged to ask questions or provide feedback on the document so that the LOC may enhance the document to reflect a more accurate business environment. Your comments and feedback may or may not be utilized in the final document.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances shall any expenses be repaid as a result of contractor engagement with RFI this notice.</p>
<p>Please send any questions/feedback on the attached Statement of Work and/or capability statements to Contracting Officer James Robinson at jarobinson@loc.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a follow-on sole source contract to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) of Tucson, Arizona, for manufacture and integration of six (6) SM-3 Block IIA (SM-3 IIA) missiles for the United States (US) Government, and a priced option for manufacture and integration of SM-3 Block IIA (SM-3 IIA) missiles for Foreign Military Sale (FMS). This requirement is part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program. This effort continues manufacturing and activities necessary to complete the SM-3 IIA All-Up Rounds (AURs) integration with the Aegis BMD weapon system, and systems engineering / analysis required for transition to production efforts needed in support of initial and full production decisions. The contract will include the necessary labor and the material for manufacture and integration of all missile sections into AURs. This contractor is a highly specialized source and no other known suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements. RMS has been the AUR design agent for all Standard Missile variants since 1966. As a result of RMS&rsquo;s involvement in the Aegis BMD Program, it is the only known source that currently possesses the in-depth technical knowledge of the system to satisfactorily perform the work. This expertise cannot be attained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of performance without incurring a substantial duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Agency's requirements. The anticipated period of performance is four (4) years after contract award. The proposed contract action is for a total of 11 SM-3 IIA missiles for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Missile Systems directly.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG's) need.
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess technologies that support Mass Rescue Operations (MRO) at sea. MRO are Search and Rescue (SAR) operations characterized by the need to provide immediate assistance to large numbers of persons in distress in a situation that exceeds the capabilities normally available to SAR authorities.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC) is conducting research to identify non-standard, innovative, large capacity, ultra-lightweight floating devices that could be deployed from air and surface assets during mass rescue operations. The desired large capacity floating devices are not required to meet standard Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) requirements for lifesaving apparatus or domestic life saving apparatus requirements under 46 Code of Federal Regulation. The purpose of a large capacity floating device is to solely keep survivors out of the water during a mass rescue operation. Current USCG/SOLAS compliant 100-person inflatable rafts can weigh upwards of 800 pounds, which is far too heavy for a single individual to safely and easily deploy from a helicopter or a fixed wing aircraft without cargo ramps.</p>
<p>The desired large capacity floating device will differ from existing off-the-shelf USCG/SOLAS compliant "life-saving appliances" by its lighter weight, increased portability and limited functionality (e.g. only keeping people out of the water for a limited time, no survival supplies or equipment, etc.).</p>
<p>Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) of the large capacity floating device include:</p>
<p>1) Ability to provide up to 100 persons temporary refuge from the water for up to 36 hours.<br />2) Weight of device (entire packaged system as deployed) should not exceed 100 lbs.<br />3) Ability to be deployed from a helicopter, fixed wing aircraft without a cargo ramp, or boat <br />4) Ability to operate in up to a maximum Sea State 5 condition<br />5) Allows safe egress from the water<br />6) Ability to operate in water temperatures between 35 - 85&deg;F<br />7) Ability to operate in air temperatures between 0 - 120&deg;F</p>
<p>SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />We are interested in existing products, prototypes and concepts that can meet or partially address requirements (e.g. slightly lower capacity at the weight threshold). Vendors should complete a copy of the &lsquo;USCG Large Capacity Floating Device Capabilities Checklist' (Attachment A). When responding to this RFI, please provide the following information (Pictures or drawings are encouraged):<br /><br />1) A description of the large-capacity floating device including materials, dimensions and specifications. <br />2) Vision or methodology of how to construct a large-capacity floating device.<br />3) An explanation of how the weight requirement is or will be achieved.<br />4) Any unique challenges (e.g. developmental, manufacturing, deployment or operations) associated with a lighter weight, large capability floating device. <br />5) Identify whether you are a Small or Large Business using NAICS Code 336612</p>
<p>There is a related RFI Titled "Mass Rescue Life Saving Appliance - Materials" researching innovative, ultra-lightweight materials(s) that could be used in the construction of a large capacity floating device.<br />&nbsp;<br />USCG intends to publish results of RFI in a public market research report. Please omit or mark any proprietary information that you don't wish to be published.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. There is no guarantee that the Government will pursue a solicitation for any of the requirements identified in the future. All information received in response to this RFI will NOT BE RETURNED. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED, VOICE MAIL MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED AND EMAILS WILL NOT BE RESPONDED TO.</p>
<p>Information submitted will be reviewed by Government personnel only at the USCG RDC.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should be emailed to: RDC-SMB-MRLSA@uscg.mil<br />Please direct any questions regarding the posting of this RFI to: RDC-SMB-MRLSA@uscg.mil<br />Questions or requested clarifications regarding this RFI must be submitted no later than (NLT) November 29, 2019. The deadline for final responses to the RFI is 16 December 2019.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This announcement seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE. This is for Market Research only. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from all qualified businesses concerning the potential project described below. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.
<p>Responses are to be sent via email to airron.d.wiggins@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time November 15, 2019. <br /><br />Project Description: Clearwell and Reservoir Cleaning Service Contract - 2020, Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be for an Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery contract and it will be advertised as a Full and Open Competition Request for Proposal (RFP) in the $10M - $15M range (total ceiling). The expected total ordering of all task orders is in the $1M - $5M range. The NAICS code is 221310. The work includes industrial cleaning of sub-surface concrete Clearwells and Reservoirs, solids handling and disposal services at multiple locations in Washington, DC, NW. Specific work items include power washing the interior of concrete water storage tanks, collection, dewatering, and disposal of lime sediments, chemical application for disinfection and dechlorination of water, and the furnishing and operation of pumps and temporary generators.</p>
<p>The Washington Aqueduct provides potable water to approximately one million people in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. As part of the water treatment and supply system, the Washington Aqueduct maintains seven (7) underground storage tanks at its Water Treatment Plants and at various pressure zones within the city. The tanks are important components of the water supply system. The intent of the contract will be to clean 2 - 3 of these tanks each year, at any time, though due to unforeseen circumstances that number may change. The scheduling of service outages to accommodate the tank cleaning may be at short notice, and the duration of each tank outage is constrained. Hence, an experienced contractor with resources and expertise to handle the following project constraints is needed:</p>
<p>i. The capacity of the reservoirs to be cleaned, are between 15 million gallons and 30 million gallons, with anticipated settled solids volumes of 100-1000 in-place cubic yards. The average out of service duration for completion of the cleaning work is eight (8) weeks.<br />ii. The reservoirs are underground concrete structure with limited access and ventilation, and some are equipped with baffling walls. The Contractor is responsible for all lighting, ventilation, and confined space entry procedures per EM 385-1-1.<br />iii. The reservoir may or may not have gravity drains, and should be presumed to contain some volume of residual water due to sloping and contours of the floor and leakage through isolation gates. The Contractor shall be responsible for pumping to remove any remaining water to allow for the cleaning.<br />iv. The reservoirs are used to store treated and potable water, so all materials used therein shall be NSF 61 approved. No equipment that uses hydraulic oil or other contaminant can be used in the reservoir. <br />v. The reservoirs are subsurface structures some of which are located in residential neighborhoods where there is limited space for storage and staging outside of the reservoir. Access openings into these reservoirs is limited and the live load that can be placed on each reservoir roof slab is also limited.</p>
<p>Interested qualified firms should submit a concise narrative and specific project examples of similar size and scope that demonstrate their experience in:</p>
<p>1. Performing contract administration tasks, mobilizing, and completing cleaning services within limited time durations, and addressing contingencies to maintain schedule completion dates. <br />2. Performing industrial cleaning services of underground concrete tanks of volumes in excess of 10 million gallons used for the storage of potable water involving the power washing and operation of other equipment in confined spaces. <br />3. Operating solids collection, handling, and the disposal logistics of residual solids in volumes of 100 to 1000 cubic yards in place on constrained footprints that limit equipment layout and storage space.<br />4. Furnishing and operating pumping and temporary generator equipment within noise ordinance limits, to include the managing of pumping for initial draining and throughout the performance of the work.<br />5. Managing the application of chemicals to disinfect and neutralize large volumes of water within regulated limits per industry standard procedures.<br />6. Furnishing and application of chemicals for the disinfection (e.g. sodium hypochlorite) or neutralization (e.g. sodium bisulfate) of potable water, and the management of such procedures for the volumes of water described above per industry standards.</p>
<p>Capability statements should include information and details of similar projects, to include demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in:</p>
<p>(a) Details of scope, volumes, and durations of similar projects, to include demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in similar projects.<br />(b) Listing of the type and sources of equipment to be used, and their projected production rates, including sufficient access to such equipment to meet mobilization time and schedule completion milestones, as well as contingency response to equipment breakdown.<br />(c) A listing of qualifications and experience of personnel on similar projects and with similar equipment.<br />(d) Knowledge of performance or management of industrial cleaning services in confined spaces.<br />(e) Knowledge of performance or management of solids handling and disposal logistics.<br />(f) Knowledge of performance or management of potable water chemical application and testing per industry standards.<br />(g) Knowledge of quality control, scheduling, and safety procedures and documentation.<br />(h) Knowledge of common risks to performance on similar projects and ability to plan for contingencies to meet schedule requirements.</p>
<p>Narratives shall be no longer than ten pages. A minimum 11 point font size applies. Arial or Times New Roman fonts are required. Email responses are preferred.</p>
<p>Comments will be shared with the Government and the project design team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence.</p>
<p>Responses must include the Offerors' name, POC phone number, SAM information and email address.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE: This notice is issued to inform all vendors interested in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Contract Opportunities and related public announcements that effective November 8, 2019, vendors must go the FAA Contract Opportunities website https://faaco.faa.gov for FAA procurement related announcements.  Announcements will no longer be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website https://www.fbo.gov.  The FBO (FedBizOpps) transition to beta.SAM.gov is scheduled for Nov. 8-11, 2019, and FAA contract opportunities are not currently planned to transition to beta.SAM.gov.  This is an interim notification and FAA anticipates resolution of system compatibility issues to allow for publication to beta.SAM.gov in the future.

 
BACKGROUND: The Integrated Award Environment (IAE) is a Presidential E-Government initiative managed by the General Services Administration (GSA). The Integrated Award Environment manages 10 federal information technology systems that enable searching for, applying for, and tracking federal awards as well as registration capabilities. IAE is in the process of merging these ten âlegacyâ sites into one systemâthe System for Award Management (SAM).  

Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) is an IAE legacy site that allows vendors to review Federal Procurement Opportunities. GSA is planning to migrate FBO from the legacy site into the âOpportunitiesâ module in beta.SAM.gov.  FAA is currently testing compatibility of procurement field entries with those required for beta.SAM to assess potential transition and use of beta.SAM for announcement of FAA contract opportunities.  In the interim, and as always, the official site for FAA contract opportunity announcements can be found at https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm/announcement/search.
										
										If you're viewing this announcement from a source other than Federal Aviation Administration Contract Opportunities (FAACO), visit https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm/announcement/view/35025 to view the original announcement.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner(s) for a promising commercial invention entitled, "Safe Impact Resistant Electrolyte (SAFIRE)."</span></p>
<p><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Problem:</span></em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> Images of electric vehicles and personal electronics on fire demonstrate the problematic reality of lithium-ion batteries. The electrolyte in a lithium-ion battery is traditionally built from highly flammable organic solvents that present a fire hazard in the event of an internal short circuit - contact between positive and negative electrodes.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Solution:</span></em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> This project focuses on the scale-up and safety demonstration of shear thickening electrolytes for advanced battery applications developed at ORNL. The Safe Impact Resistant Electrolyte (SAFIRE) transformative design results in the electrolyte functioning as a safety feature of the battery and eliminating the risk of thermal runaway. The SAFIRE electrolyte is a liquid under normal operating conditions, allowing solvents to wet all the electrode surfaces just like a traditional battery electrolyte. However, upon impact, as caused by a car crash or some other mechanical impact or kinetic event, the additive causes the electrolyte to undergo an immediate and massive rheological shift to become a solid. The solid barrier prevents the positive and negative electrodes from coming into contact and short circuiting. By preventing the electrodes from touching, none of the energy stored in the battery components is released.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Impact:</span></em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> Emerging technology markets, such as those within the automotive industry, depend on safe electrical energy storage. The SAFIRE electrolyte challenges previous notions regarding battery safety/engineering and will turn the electrolyte into an intrinsic part of the battery safety envelope. Beyond the safety aspects of this electrolyte, the value added from this technology enables the redesign of battery packaging and battery placement to introduce design flexibility to end users. Additional SAFIRE market impact is in US military applications, specifically batteries that double as body armor and/or safer portable drone batteries.</span></p>

However automotive designs require extensive R&amp;D efforts for longevity and safety. In addition, OEM's generally will not develop a new technology unless instructed by the manufacturers. To attract automotive interest, ORNL needs to demonstrate the technology on a suitable scale. Hence, the TIP approach is to demonstrate the technology in small-scale niche applications (i.e., body armor for military applications) said batteries only need to last for a few months before replacement. Results from these initial applications will facilitate industrial acceptance and buy-in from the automotive manufactures and result in OEM's investing in the technology and commercialization.</span></p>

When the technology has matured, typically 6-9 months after project start, ORNL issues a call for license applications. This call is announced via email and posted on FedBizOpps.gov approximately around Oct. 30, 2018.

<SUBJECT>66--NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<SOLNBR>68HE0B20Q0033
<ARCHDATE>11162019
<CONTACT>Porter, Anthony
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b)(1), the US Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a sole source fixed-priced Purchase Order. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  Office of Research and Development, Natural Systems Characterization Branch (NSCB) located in Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, has a requirement for the following new equipment items:

1.  Pandora1S Head Sensor
2.  Pandora 1S UV/VIS Spectrometer and temperature control housing
3.  Rack System Environmental Protection Housing
4.  Pandora Enhanced Sun Tracker
5.  Pandora 1S Instrument Controller
6.  Pandora Fiber guide
7.  Head Sensor Shipping Case, SKB
8.  Wide temperature instrument control computer
 
SciGlob Instruments and Services, LLC of 6339 Howard Lane, Elkridge, Maryland USA is the sole manufacturer of Pandora spectrometer system related hardware, including but not limited to the Pandora 1S and Pandora2S models and the Pandora(1S/2S) Sun Tracker. Exclusive rights, licensing, and proprietary information related to the aforementioned products are held by SciGlob and as such, there are no authorized resellers or distributors in the United States of America. 

The EPA, in cooperation with NASA, has developed an air quality remote sensing system based on Pandora spectrometers. This system has been deployed nationwide to federal and state air quality monitoring sites as part of the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program.  The EPA has developed Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for these Pandora spectrometers.  Interoperability with the existing equipment is required.   Development of a new remote sensing system based on instruments from different manufacturers would present an undue burden by requiring significant time and monetary resources to be spent on redesigning the EPAÂ¿s data processing code and require significant QAPP revisions.   

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 333314 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement; and is issued for notification purposes only.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it can meet this requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement being requested by 3:00 PM EST on November  15, 2019.  Responses must be submitted in writing to porter.anthony@epa.gov no later than the time and date noted above.  Telephone responses and requests will not be accepted.

A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct competitive procurement.

All current and potential contractors shall use FedConnect which is available at https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/default.htm. There is no charge to use FedConnect. FedConnect is hosted by Compusearch, all related questions from vendors/contractors will be answered by Compusearch. If having issues with FedConnect or not registered in FedConnect at this time an exception is extended, and alternate responses may be received by e-mail: porter.anthony@epa.gov.

<SUBJECT>B--NOI - Malheur Lake samples - phytoplankton
<SOLNBR>140G0320Q0004
<CONTACT>Fejarang, Charlan
<DESC>The USGS, Oregon Water Science Center has a requirement for Phytoplankton Identification, Enumeration and Biovolume for environmental water samples. 

The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 12 and 13.106-1(b)(1) to Phycotech, Inc.  PhycoTech Inc. has performed all the analyses since 1990 on samples collected for from Upper Klamath Lake, another lake in south-central Oregon located about 260 miles from the MNWR. Both lakes are located in basin-and-range topography with similar land use characteristics and have many similarities including being large shallow lakes. These lakes experience similar weather patterns and, on a longer time scale, similar climate cycles. Comparison of the phytoplankton communities between the two is of the utmost importance to the mission of the Oregon Water Science Center. 

Methodology is less standardized for phytoplankton enumeration samples (see item number 8) than it is for chemical constituents, and therefore if datasets are to be compared, the choice of laboratory is more critical than it is for many chemical constituents (nutrients, for example).  This is recognized in the USGS National Field Manual (Chapter 7.5, Cyanobacteria in lakes and reservoirs: toxin and taste-and-odor sampling guidelines) where it is stated in the Quality Control section (7.5.5E) that Â¿use of a single laboratory throughout the study is recommendedÂ¿ for phytoplankton analyses because taxonomic identification and enumeration are often inconsistent among laboratories. Therefore, laboratory consistency between projects and continuity through time is required.

The Government anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price type contract.  All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov.  Please contact the Contracting Officer, in writing, by email at cjfejarang@usgs.gov, with any questions.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no competitive solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements or provide an equal product may give written notification to the contract specialist for consideration. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed above for the requested products. Responses are due by 4 Nov 2019 at 6:00 AM PST.

Responses must be e-mailed to deborah.sosa@va.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  No reimbursement for any costs associated with providing capability statements will be provided by the Government.

Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect. Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems. Companies are required to notify the JCP office of any changes during the certification period.

No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. SAM and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, contractors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Once contractors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system. Contractors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.<br /><br />6. Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.<br /><br /><br />

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance (iii) price.<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>1. Technical. The Technical factor will be evaluated and assigned an overall rating based on these subfactors:<br />a. Qualifications of SME's (Subject Matter Experts). Proposals which exhibit SMEs an Offeror is bringing to this event who possess real world experience with first responder backgrounds will be rated higher than proposals which do not.<br />b. The Offeror's plan on how it will satisfy the requirements for role players, weighted manikins, and moulage artist support for this event.<br />c. How the Offeror will satisfy the security and safety requirements measures described in the PWS.<br />The Technical factor will be assigned an overall rating using one of the following ratings:</p>
<p>Adjectival Rating Description<br /><br />- Outstanding Proposal indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements and contains multiple strengths, and risk of unsuccessful performance is low.<br />- Good Proposal indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements and contains at least one strength, and risk of unsuccessful performance is low to moderate.<br />- Acceptable Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.<br />- Marginal Proposal has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and/or risk of non-performance is high.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not meet requirements of the solicitation, and thus, contains one or more deficiencies, and/or risk of unsuccessful performance is unacceptable. Proposal is un-awardable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Past Performance. This consists of two parts. Offers are to provide a summary of past work within these areas:</p>
<p>- Relevance - Relevance addresses how closely past work associates with the current requirement.<br />- Recency - Performance older than 3 years may not be rated as highly as performance in the past year.</p>
<p>There is no minimum number of projects or contracts to be listed. Provide narrative regarding the size of the requirements (scope and dollar magnitude) and to the kind of customer (military, etc...). References are encouraged.<br />Relevance will be judged on the following scale:<br />Past Performance Relevance Ratings Rating Definition<br /><br />- Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />- Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat<br />- Relevant Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Based on evaluation results of the 2 Past Performance Subfactors, the Past Performance Factor will be assigned one of the following Performance Confidence Assessments:<br />Performance Confidence Assessments Rating Definition<br /><br />- Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />- Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />- Neutral No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be assigned. The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance.<br />- Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />- No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />3. Price. While price is an important factor, it is not more important than the other factors. Price must be reasonable and it must reflect market pricing. Pricing that is too low may be deemed as unrealistic, and could be interpreted to mean the offeror does not account for all of the cost implications of the work. <br />The Government intends to award without discussion.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<CONTACT>Stephanie Kelly, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-5382, Email stephanie.kelly@nist.gov
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
<p><br />I. Background<br />NIST currently has licenses for the Foglight Transaction Recorder and Player, which NIST uses to mimic a set of users of Web applications for Web application performance monitoring. The Foglight Transaction Recorder allows NIST to record a series of actions against a Web application (also known as synthetic transactions) and save the recorded actions as a script. The scripts (synthetic transactions) are then played by the Foglight Transaction Player at scheduled intervals which is configured, controlled and initiated at Foglight Management Server (FMS). The performance data from each step in a script is collected and stored locally. The historical performance data is saved on the Foglight server and used for data analysis and generation of detailed and summary reports. Support for the Foglight Transaction Recorder and Player will end in January 2020. NIST seeks to purchase a new software product to replace the capabilities of the Foglight Transaction Recorder and Player. <br /><br /><br />II. Scope</p>
<p>The requirements are for perpetual software licenses for the new software product; one year of software support and maintenance for the new product, including security patches, upgrades to new versions of the product, help desk support for the product for bugs NIST finds and for questions NIST will have about using the software; and 40 hours of on-site consulting time for assistance with installing and configuring the new product.</p>
<p>III. Minimum Technical Requirements</p>
<p>NIST requires the new software product to be installed and configured by January 31, 2020. The purchase shall include both the new software product itself and perpetual licenses for the software.<br />The new software product shall:<br />1. Model an end-user's actions against a Web application via the creation of scripts (also known as synthetic transactions).<br />2. Enable synthetic transaction recording and playback for 100 Web application instances.<br />3. Provide a graphical user environment for recording scripts.<br />4. Record each end-user's actions in the script against a live Web application.<br />5. Allow a subset of the actions in a script to be grouped and saved as a separate script that can be modified and regrouped and be able to insert to a different script.<br />6. Maintain the library of saved scripts.<br />7. Allow the application administrator to schedule each saved script to be replayed later automatically on a fixed interval schedule. Each script shall be able to play on its own schedule.<br />8. The performance data from each step in a script shall be collected and stored either on the transaction player machine, or on a server running on NIST's premises. No data shall be sent to any server outside of NIST's network. <br />9. The historical performance data saved from the playback of scripts shall be accessible for data analysis and reporting via a secure Web application interface, and for export in comma-separated variable (CSV) format.<br />10. The application shall interface with NIST's Foglight Management Server and copy the historical performance data saved from the playback of scripts to the Foglight server for analysis with other performance data collected by the Foglight.<br />11. The transaction recorder and player parts of the product shall be installed and supported on client computers running the Windows 10 operating system.<br />Support and maintenance shall include software updates and security patches at no additional cost for one year, telephone/online support from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and an unlimited number of contacts during the support period. Software updates shall be available to NIST within one working day after being posted to the vendor's support Web site. Telephone support shall include response to questions regarding operating practices, application use, and support issues that can be diagnosed and resolved over the telephone.<br />40 hours of on-site consulting shall include installation and configuration of the software.

<p><strong>EVALUATION METHOD</strong></p>
<p>Technical proposals will be evaluated using a summary adjectival rating in accordance with the following scale:</p>
<p>Excellent<br />The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes several advantageous characteristics of substance, and very few disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and<br />precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Very Low</p>
<p>Good<br />The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Low</p>
<p>Acceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect moderate risk in that they may be somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and/or demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Neutral</p>
<p>Marginal<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages present a low or questionable likelihood of resulting in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and/or do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: High</p>
<p>Unacceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions may also be considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision. Risk Level: Very High</p>

8. EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS
The Government will select the quote that represents the best benefit to the Government at a price that can be determined reasonable. The Government will evaluate price, technical capabilities, and past performance. Specific quote requirements are detailed below in  ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items .  

Following receipt of quotes, the Government will perform an evaluation using a comparative evaluation of the services quoted in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3). The Government will compare quotes to one another to select the quote that best benefits the Government by fulfilling the requirement. 

Additional information pertaining to Comparative Evaluation below: 

 What Comparative Evaluation is: 
It is the direct comparison of one quotation/offer with another in a uniform and fair manner to determine which quote/offer provides the Government what it needs, where and when as identified in the RFQ
It is an assessment of which response is the  best  as a whole
Once one quotation/offer is found acceptable, it is compared side by side to the remaining ones, and the  best  one is chosen

 What Comparative Evaluation is not: 
It does not individually evaluate quote/offers against specified evaluation factors
It does not assign a rating using a color, numerical, or other rating methodology
It does not require additional evaluation to determine if minimal advantage is worth a minimal or normal price difference, but not prohibited
It is not a low price technically acceptable (LPTA) or trade-off process

Contractors may submit more than one quote; however, contractors are strongly encouraged to submit their best technical solutions and prices in response to this request for quote. All quotes must be submitted by the deadline to be considered for evaluation.

Once the Government determines there is/are a contractor(s) that can provide a service that meet(s) the requirements of this request for quote, the Government reserves the right to communicate with only those contractors quoting the best-suited service to address any remaining issues.

9. CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS
The full text of FAR and VAAR provisions or clauses may be accessed electronically at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html and http://www.va.gov/oal/library/vaar/index.asp. 

The following solicitation provisions apply to this acquisition:

FAR 52.212-1,  Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items  (OCT 2018)
(ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items )

All offers must include:

 Â Â Â Â  Solicitation number for this requirement: ERIE 36C24420Q0057
 Â Â Â Â  Name, address, telephone number, DUNS number of contractor.
 Â Â Â Â  Contractor POC information to include: name, title, telephone number and email.

 Â Â Â Â  The contractor must submit a capability statement demonstrating their technical capability, general and Government experience, and ability to meet the full scope of the statement of work (SOW) within the period of performance. Technical capability statements which merely restate the SOW requirements will not be favorably evaluated. Technical capability statements must include the following:
1] Contractor shall provide a detailed work plan demonstrating ability to respond to and complete VA courier service requests in accordance with the standards indicated in the SOW. In addition, this work plan should include an in-depth staffing plan.
2] Contractor shall provide a detailed and well-defined Quality Assessment workflow with a focus on adherence to the performance standards indicated in the SOW. The workflow must demonstrate how the contractor will meet and adhere to the standards indicated in the SOW, and how they will identify and address any deviations from those standards.

 Â Â Â Â  Completed Price Schedule to include Unit Price, Total Price, and Grand Total. Failure to provide complete pricing, including pricing for each CLIN, will result in the contractor s package being determined to be incomplete and not considered for award.

 Â Â Â Â  Contractor shall provide three past performance references of similar size and scope. Past performance references shall include customer point of contact and phone number, a contract number or project title, and a short description of the effort to include role performed and dollar value of the effort. The Contracting Officer may utilize all available records (e.g. PPIPRS and FAPIIS) as well to evaluate a contractor s past performance.

 Â Â Â Â  Acknowledgement of any solicitation amendments.
 Â Â Â Â  A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation.
 Â Â Â Â  Offers that fail to furnish required representation or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration.

The following provisions are incorporated into 52.212-1 as an addendum to this contract. Provisions that are incorporated by reference (by Citation Number, Title, and Date), have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.
52.204-7 System for Award Management (OCT 2018) 
52.204-16 Commercial and Government Entity Code Reporting (JUL 2016)
52.217-5  Evaluation of Options (52.217-5)
The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 12 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 15 days.
(End of Clause)

(Addendum to FAR 52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES)
For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows:
The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but for no more than a total of six months during the life of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised. The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. <br /><br />Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>A few questions have been received regarding the draft RFP that was posted last Friday.</p>
<p>1. Regarding the lease terms of the buildings that will be used, the lease terms and costs will be a "passthrough" to the contractor. At the time of final RFP, we will include those costs in the proper CLINs and all offerors will use those numbers. The contractor will not be responsible for negotiating any lease terms.</p>
<p>2. The close date for the draft RFP is 3 December. We anticipate the final RFP release sometime in January 2020.</p>

<DESC>(2) Second Modified Amendment:
<p>Vendor Question: Is a benchtop OES system the only solution being considered for this specification? A full size laboratory OES system is far<br />superior in specifications to any benchtop OES solution and just want to confirm that your analytical needs are being fully met by the system specified in the bid statement of work.</p>
<p>Answer: My write up states a benchtop because we have a lot of space constraints in our lab. I wouldn't mind using a floor based spectrometer, but I'm not sure<br />that I have a space for it. Because of that I would say that we only will consider benchtop units.</p>

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, Cont...<BR><BR>(3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>The objective of this acquisition is to obtain support services for the TTC simulator configuration control program which enables the NRC training program for inspectors, license examiners, and others which, in turn, supports the NRC's mission to provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety, to promote the common defense and security, and to protect the environment.</p>
<p>The goal is to acquire simulator configuration control program support for all simulators currently located at the TTC or that may be installed at the TTC during the term of this contract. The support will consist of hardware support, software support, general support, and simulator engineering expert support.</p>
<p>Hardware support shall include various hardware preventative maintenance, corrective maintenance, and modification activities. The activities will include troubleshooting, testing, component installation, vendor support, hardware modifications, and hardware configuration management including the use of an administrative configuration control system.</p>
<p>Software support shall include network administration, software preventative maintenance, and software modification activities. The activities will include issue identification, troubleshooting, modifications, imaging, backups, testing, updates, network administration, and software configuration control including the use of an administrative configuration control system.</p>
<p>General support shall include activities to support simulator operations, component control, and documentation. The activities will include simulator system startups, shutdowns, resets, and preparation for daily training; simulator component purchases and component control; and documentation of simulator configurations and maintenance activities.</p>
<p>Simulator engineering expert support shall include activities to supplement on-site support with off-site support when requested and as needed to perform advanced simulator hardware and software work. Expert support activities may include RELAP and MELCOR model changes, Encore MPX assembler coding, or changes to the I/O interface.<br /><br />The solicitation and resultant contract shall be issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5. The resultant purchase order will consist of a base period of one year (beginning on or about September 16, 2019) plus four one-year options to extend the term of the purchase order.</p>
<p>The government intends to award a purchase order resulting from the solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quotation represents the best value to the government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered. Anticipated evaluation factors for award include adequacy of technical approach; past performance information; adequacy of management and staffing plan; adequacy of corporate capability and experience, and evaluated cost/price.</p>
<p>The NRC uses Compusearch Software Systems' secure and auditable two-way web portal, FedConnect, to communicate with offerors and contractors. FedConnect provides bi-directional communication between the offeror/contractor and the NRC throughout the preaward, award and postaward phases. Therefore, in order submit a proposal, the offeror must register to use FedConnect at https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/PUblicUserRegistration.aspx. Assistance with FedConnect is provided by Compusearch Software Systems, not the NRC. FedConnect contact and assistance information is provided at https://www.fedconnect.net.</p>
<p><strong>The solicitation and any related amendments will be released only via FedConnect; therefore, potential quoters must register at https://www.fedconect.net to access the solicitation and amendments. The solicitation is anticipated to be posted on FedConnect on or about November 1, 2019. Potential quoters are encouraged to check FedConnect regularly for solicitation availability and amendments to it. In addition, the NRC will only consider proposals that are submitted via FedConnect.</strong> <br /><br />By submission of a quotation, the quoter acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the System for Award Management database at www.sam.gov prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any resultant purchase order.</p>

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR SF 330'S ARCHITECT/ENGINEER QUALIFICATION PACKAGES ONLY.  
General Description  NAICS Codes 541310 and 541330 Apply  
Do Not Submit Proposals for this Draft Sources Sought Notice.
The purpose of this Notice is Amendment 03 is to provide responses to the RFIs received as a result of this sources sought notice.  This Amendment 03 also is to inform potential offerors that No responses should be submitted for this Sources Sought as the evaluation criteria and submittals were for Draft purposes only.  A solicitation will be posted in the near future for this requirement.  
NAICS 541310 - Architectural Services; NAICS 541330 - Engineering Services.Â 
DISCLAIMER
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.
See attached document: Attach 1_AE SELECTION CRITERIA(1).
See attached document: Attach 2_V8 AE MATOC SOW (rev Sept 2019)1.
See attached document: Attach 3_General Requirement, Project V08-20-110

Response to RFI Questions:
What type of CITP Code Compliance Specialist are you wanting a resume for? Is it for environmental/geotechnical compliance, building code compliance, energy compliance?  Do you have a list of preferred vendors for this?

Response:  No list of vendors available.  Include CITP Compliance for the resume you intend to submit in order to qualify and compete for this requirement.  

Is there a list of the incumbents currently performing the requirements for this IDIQ?

Response:

List of Incumbents:
 36C24819D0019 Toland Mizell Molnar
 36C24819D0020 Stollo & Strollo
 36C24819D0021 AKEA Design
 36C24819D0022 AESUS Design
 36C24819D0023 RDC/JPA

With regard to the subject solicitation on FedBizOpps, we request that you consider opening this solicitation to NAICS Code 541330 (Engineering) in order to increase the number of SDVOSB eligible firms to pursue. Based upon the General Description of work, there appears to be a substantial amount of engineering services required (MEP/FP, Structural, Civil, etc.). Â Â By addition of this NAICS Code, the VA would increase the pool of competitors for the contract.

Has any decision been made as to adding the 541130 NAICS code or changing to the 541330 NAICS code for the referenced solicitation?

Would it be possible to change the NAICS code to 541330? The SBA small business size standard for the 541330 NAICS code is $16.5M, whereas the SBA small business size standard for the 541310 NAICS code is $8M. These size standard values were recently increased in August by the SBA.

In our experience with IDIQ contracts with the VA, the type of work described in the statement of work is more engineering related then architectural related.

The advantage to the government is that there will be more competition with the higher value NAICS code of $16.5M. You will have better qualified firms submitting with the higher NAICS code.

 Response to questions 3, 4, and 5:  

The VA does anticipate the use both NAICS Codes, 541310 and 541330.Â  
The following information regarding NAICS Codes from the NAICS Code Census is provided:

If the establishment is primarily providing architectural design services during the planning period of the building (but not primarily during construction, and not as a part of an architect-builder), the most appropriate code would typically be NAICS 541310 - Architectural Services.Â  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in planning and designing residential, institutional, leisure, commercial, and industrial buildings and structures by applying knowledge of design, construction procedures, zoning regulations, building codes, and building materials.Â  For more information on this code, please visit the Census Bureau's website: http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/.

If the establishment is acting as both the architect and the builder (general contractor) for the construction of an institutional building, the most appropriate code would typically be NAICS 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.Â  This industry comprises establishments primarily responsible for the construction (including new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs) of commercial and institutional buildings and related structures, such as stadiums, grain elevators, and indoor swimming facilities. This industry includes establishments responsible for the on-site assembly of modular or prefabricated commercial and institutional buildings. Included in this industry are commercial and institutional building general contractors, commercial and institutional building for-sale builders, commercial and institutional building design-build firms, and commercial and institutional building project construction management firms.Â  For more information on this code, please visit the Census Bureau's website: http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/.

If the establishment is assisting in providing professional engineering skills before, during, and throughout construction (but not actually constructing the building or acting as a general contractor), the most appropriate code would typically be NAICS 541330 - Engineering Services.Â  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in applying physical laws and principles of engineering in the design, development, and utilization of machines, materials, instruments, structures, processes, and systems. The assignments undertaken by these establishments may involve any of the following activities: provision of advice, preparation of feasibility studies, preparation of preliminary and final plans and designs, provision of technical services during the construction or installation phase, inspection and evaluation of engineering projects, and related services.Â 


As shown below, the maximum task order amount is $100,000. This is extremely low for a $50,000,000 capacity and the type of work described.

Response:  

Attachment 3, page 1 changes the upper limit per task order from $100,000 to $2,000,000.
Attachment 3, page 4 changes the requirement from $950,000 ceiling to $50,000,000 ceiling.

Document below in your Solicitation asks for 5 criteria to be addressed.Â  These criteria are not in the order in which a government SF330 is written.Â  

https://www.fbo.gov/index.php?s=opportunity&mode=form&tab=core&id=77623065093d7765f806c45cfefb999f&_cview=0

Criterion 1 is to be addressed  g. All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF330. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1. 

Criterion 2 is to be addressed  c.Provide professional registration, certification, licensure and/or accreditation. Indicate participation of key personnel in example projects in the SF 330 Part 1 Section G. 

Criterion 3 does not ask us where to include it in the SF330 and is not normally included in an SF330.Â  Where does that go?

Response:  Provide under the SF330, Part I, Section H.  Additional Information

Criterion 4 does not ask us where to include it in the SF330 and is not normally included in an SF330.Â  Where does that go?

Response:  Provide under SF330, Part I, Section H.  Additional Information (Based on Criterion 1 Submission)

Criterion 5- This looks cut and pasted.Â  It looks like half of the cut and paste is missing . VI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Criterion 5 - Experience and Qualifications
Submission requirements: Offerors shall submit evidence of individuals experience and qualifications in their respective fields. Additionally, documentation must be provided to show these individuals have worked together as a team on previous projects and their role. (Completing Sections E, F, and G, on theÂ  STOPS ??????? Â Where is this criteria addressed?

Response:  This was a typo.  Remove the b. to continue into next paragraph.  

In this document- https://www.vendorportal.ecms.va.gov/FBODocumentServer/DocumentServer.aspx?DocumentId=5178769&FileName=36C24819Q1609-007.docx

We are asked to submit 
Â One (1) CD -digital version of the hard copy SF 330 submission package.
Three Ring Binder Format (Required)
Cover Page
Table of Contents
Tab A: Supplemental Information 
Tab B: SF 330
Tab C: Miscellaneous Information(


Shouldn t this information go in Section H of the SF330 format as required in the attached government format?Â  This is confusing.Â  Tab A and C are already addressed in the Government SF330 format(attached) So we would have to include them twice?

Response:  This information is changed to require electronic submission only   no hard copies.  However, do provide this information as requested.  Cover Page, Table of Contents, Tab A -Supplemental Information, Tab B - SF330 and Tab C - Miscellaneous Information.


Are you asking for a standard government SF330, or an SF330 that additionally/supplementals/addresses the issues above??Â  There is no cover page or table of contents in an SF330 for additional example- instead the SF330 is organized in the exact standardized format attached.Â  Â I have attached the SF330 Format, I don t see a lot of this information required in this format that is asked for in the solicitation, and the format of the information requested does not follow the Sf330 format attached.

Response:  Please submit information in the format requested.

Can the RFP requirements be rewritten, to follow the standard government SF330 which is attached.Â  This format is followed by USACE and almost all of the VAs.Â  This would eliminate any confusion.Â  I have examples of other IDIQ RFPS from the VA that follow the Sf330 format exactly if you would like me to send some over for your review/use that are standardized if you would like to see what I am referring to.

Response:  

Offerors will be required to submit proposal information in the order/format as requested in the solicitation.  
Offerors will not be required to submit hardcopy proposals; therefore, CDs will not be required.

Our company is an ELV (Extended Low-Voltage) design firm that specializes in Audio/Video design and consulting and I am interested in this solicitation, although I do not see anything for Audio Video Design and/or Low-Voltage Design. Is this some we could submit separately that is not with an Electrical Engineer? 

Response:  You may want to consider a teaming arrangement in order to compete for this requirement under NAICS Codes 341310 or 341330.  

I could be looking in the wrong place, but I couldn t find Past Performance Questionnaire in the solicitation. Is it located somewhere? 

Response:  A draft past performance questionnaire is provided for your convenience at this 
time.

Looking through all the documents I didn t notice a page limitation for the proposals, do you know what that would be?

 Response:  
For the SF330s, there will be no page limitation except for Section H.
Section H - Page limitation:  
Criterion 3 (Ability to Accomplish Work   3 Pages); 
Criterion 4 (Past Performance, PPQs, CPARS   15 Pages).

Our company is pursuing this project, and would like to clarify which Selection Criteria we should use. 


In Attachments 2 & 3 there are different selection criteria, which one is the criteria for the submission?

Response:  Please follow the selection criteria.  The SOW evaluation criteria supplementals the evaluation criteria.  This information should enhance and not contradict selection criteria.  Your question is appreciated.  Please submit any specific questions via an RFI.  

We are a current MATOC Contract Holder in VISN 8.Â  We are in Option Year 2 of a potential 5 years.Â  It has been quite active in the past year and we are very thankful for the work we are doing throughout the VISN.

We have recently seen the solicitation for a new set of MATOC Contracts and I am wondering if these will cancel/replace the current contracts or be in addition to them.Â  Any clarification you can provide would be very valuable.

Response:  This new VISN 8 AE recompete is not to cancel or replace the current VISN 8 AE contract.  This new requirement is a re-compete to the existing VISN 8 A/E MATOC which may reach its ceiling prior to the anticipated 5-year period.

Is there a page limit to this SF330? 
Response:  

For the SF330s, there will be no page limitation except for Section H.
Section H - Page limitation:  
Criterion 3 (Ability to Accomplish Work   3 Pages); 
Criterion 4 (Past Performance, PPQs, CPARS   15 Pages).

14. Can you clarify the key personnel required to submit resumes?

Response:  Yes

Can you clarify the statement requiring A/E must meet Florida licensing requirements.Â  Is that for staff, the A/E firm or both?

Response:  Work performed by the engineering team in Florida must be licensed in the state of Florida due to our unique geographical location.Â  Florida is one of the most stringent states regarding licensure of Engineers and rarely offers reciprocity with other states.Â  There are many firms that have licensure in multiple states; therefore, the firm does not necessarily have to live in Florida.  Please present your teaming arrangement and the evaluation team will select the offerors that are most highly qualified.

Regarding Selection Criteria, Section II. a. i., is  experience with design of similar types of facilities  referencing the projects listed in the General Requirement, V08-20-100?
Response:  Yes, primarily all facilities under the VISN 8.  

The Sunshine Network (VISN 8) is one of 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  VISN 8 provides a comprehensive range of primary and tertiary healthcare services to veterans in rural and metropolitan markets in Florida, Southern Georgia, and Caribbean/Virgin Islands and is in itself the largest of the 21 VISN relative to the number of veterans served.  This IDIQ will service the VISN 8 region of VA healthcare systems, which includes 8 primary hospitals and approximately 58 outpatient clinics across the region.  The age of VISN 8 s hospital infrastructure ranges from the early 1930s to 2014, and the size of hospital campuses range from 28 acres to 313 acres, with the Bay Pines VA having the oldest buildings and is also listed on the National Historic Registry.

<DESC>This is a <strong>PREQUALIFICATION OF SOURCES</strong> announcement, issued in accordance with DFARS 236.272 and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Acquisition Instruction (UAI) 5236.272. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Respondents will be notified of the results of the Prequalification of Sources Selection.
<p><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Sacramento District is seeking to create a Prequalified Sources List (PSL) for levee improvement cutoff wall construction within the Sacramento Valley. The objective of the Prequalification of Sources process is to identify and select responding firms that demonstrate the capacity and capability to successfully support critical USACE cutoff wall construction projects and thus establish a PSL. Identifying and selecting prequalified sources will be based solely on the responding firm's ability to meet the specific criteria that assess the firm's bonding capability, capability to concurrently complete large construction projects, previous experience completing a large cutoff wall construction project, financial accounting capabilities to support potential Government fixed-price contracts, and past performance. The selection process will be objective in that responding firms either meet or fail to meet the criteria. Failure to meet any one of the criteria may result in non-selection. The criteria were designed to ensure selection of clearly qualified contractors with experience and capability relevant to the anticipated requirements, provide competition, and minimize subjectivity in the Government's assessment.</p>
<p>The PSL will be available for use while other acquisitions are underway for similar requirements. The PSL will be reviewed annually to ensure a legitimate need exists. Presently, the Government anticipates at least four contract actions over approximately the next four years. The PSL will be used as a vehicle to solicit several stand-alone "C" type construction contracts where the high-end of any single contract is not expected to exceed $100M at this time. This, however, does not preclude the Government from soliciting and awarding a contract in excess of this amount if determined to be in the Government's best interest. After the PSL is established, the Government intends to proceed by issuing solicitations using FAR Part 14 procedures (i.e., Invitation for Bid (IFB)). However, the Government reserves the right to issue solicitations using FAR Part 15 (i.e., Contracting by Negotiation (i.e., Best Value using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable up to and potentially including Trade-Off)) when determined to be in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>The SPK projects that are likely to be constructed under stand-alone contracts that will be advertised to the firms on the PSL include cutoff walls using conventional, Deep Mix Method (DMM) / Deep Soil Mixing (DSM) / Cutter Soil Mixing (CSM) / One Pass Trenching (OPT) / or Trench Cutting Re-Mixing Deep Method (TRD) methods and conventional materials including soil bentonite and/or slag cement-cement bentonite. Projects will be located within the Sacramento Valley with a particular focus on levee improvements on the Sacramento and American Rivers.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for procurements offered to firms on the Prequalified Sources list is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Construction, which has a small business size standard of $39.5M.</p>
<p><strong>Bonding Requirements:</strong> Pursuant to the Miller Act, Performance and Payment bonds shall be provided for each project awarded under the PSL. Notice to Proceed (NTP), will not be issued until after the successful bidder or offeror provides sufficient bonding to cover the work required as communicated under the project solicitation.</p>
<p>To be considered qualified for the PSL, firms must detail how they&nbsp;meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>The Contractor's company, subcontractor, joint venture partner (JVP), or merged company (MC) must have experience in cutoff walls used for seepage control within the last ten (10) years from this announcement. Multiple headings on any one contract must be considered as one construction project experience.</p>
<p>1. Conventional slurry supported cutoff wall construction project experience must include using long-reach excavators or clamshells and include at least two (2) soil bentonite (SB) cutoff walls and two (2) slag cement-cement-bentonite (SCCB) completed cutoff wall projects. For each of the four (4) projects the following cutoff wall standards must have been met to demonstrate sufficient capability:</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of 50 feet deep;<br />&bull; A minimum of 24-inches wide;<br />&bull; A minimum of 500 feet long;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec for SB cutoff walls;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec for SCCB cutoff walls at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements; and<br />&bull; The SCCB cutoff wall must have had a minimum unconfined compressive strength of 50 psi at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements.</p>
<p>2. Deep Mix Method (DMM) cutoff wall construction project experience must include in-situ soil mixing methods classified as: Wet Rotary Shaft (WRS), Wet Rotary End (WRE), Wet Rotary and Jet End (WJE) or Wet Vertical Panel (WVP), as described in the Federal Highway Administration manual Deep Mixing for Embankment and Foundation Support. This experience must also include completed construction of at least two (2) DMM cutoff wall projects including, but not limited to, Deep Soil Mixing (DSM) / Cutter Soil Mixing (CSM) / One Pass Trenching (OPT).</p>
<p>3. Trench Cutting Re-Mixing Deep (TRD) method cutoff walls. This experience must include setting up and operating the batch plant and delivery system to the cutoff wall location, and all associated work with constructing the cutoff wall. For each of the two (2) projects the following cutoff wall standards must have been met to demonstrate sufficient capability:</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of 75 feet deep;<br />&bull; A minimum of 24-inches wide;<br />&bull; A minimum of 500 feet long;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec; and<br />&bull; A minimum unconfined compressive strength of 50 psi at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements.</p>
<p>4. Earth Embankment Construction Project Experience. The Contractor's company, subcontractor, JVP, or MC must have experience in completed construction of at least one (1) project that included placing at least 50,000 cubic yards of engineered fill for flood control levee, earth dam, or earthen embankment for water retention or conveyance, completed in the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>5. Cutoff Wall Construction Project Experience Supporting Data. Example projects provided must include documentation such as contract document excerpts, not to exceed 5 pages, for each project submitted which demonstrate cutoff wall length, width, depth, permeability, and strengths requirements, as appropriate, and laboratory and testing data for cutoff wall permeability and strengths, as appropriate. Additionally, each example project must include a point of contact that may be reached if needed to verify the data.</p>
<p>6. Cutoff Wall Construction Project Experience Submission. Prequalification will be based on the cutoff wall method submitted and approved. This could include one or both of the cutoff wall methods described.</p>
<p>7. Single bonding capability of at least $50M and aggregate bonding capability of at least $200M.</p>
<p>8. Past Performance information that demonstrates satisfactory or above ratings for the projects used to demonstrate previous experience.</p>
<p><em>Certification/statement that all responses to the Prequalification of Sources are accurate and complete by a principal of the firm.</em></p>
<p><em>An individual's experience gained through employment with previous companies may qualify as the firm's experience provided the individual was substantially involved in the construction of a cutoff wall. Such substantial involvement must be clearly documented in the Capability Statement. For individual-based experience the following additional information must be provided for each individual comprising the firm's experience:<br />&bull; Identify the specific requirement / project.<br />&bull; Identify the scope of the project.<br />&bull; Identify the individual's title and role on the project.<br />&bull; Describe the scope of the individual's labor effort on the project.<br />&bull; Describe how the individual's experience constitutes "substantial involvement."</em></p>
<p><strong>On Ramp Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to utilize an On Ramp concept, to maintain sufficient competition among the PSL by adding additional contractors to the list annually. This will be done by requesting and evaluating capabilities in a manner consistent with this original announcement. The Sacramento District will implement the following opportunity to add additional PSL holders: <br />1. An On Ramp notice will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). The notice shall identify by name, the contractors who have already been added to the list. The notice shall contain the description of the prequalification requirements.<br />2. The potential contractors shall be required to meet the same capabilities established in the original PSL notice for each factor that was established. The evaluation and admission of sources will be on the same basis as the evaluation of capabilities used for the original PSL. <br />3. The announcement of a new On Ramp notice shall be made annually. <br />4. Immediately upon on-ramping, each selected contractor is eligible to bid in response to any solicitation utilizing the specified PSL procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Process:</strong></p>
<p>1. The Government will provide all of the firms on the Prequalified Sources List notification of its intent to advertise a requirement via a Presolicitation Notice. The purpose of this notice is twofold. In addition to signaling the Government's intent to advertise a requirement, this notice will also be used for subcontracting opportunities. The notification will include a brief summary of the requirement, and a request for each firm to provide the Government with a positive or negative statement of interest in proposing on the project. <br />2. The firms will be provided a closing date by which they must respond positively or negatively to their interest in competing on the specific project. In addition to indicating an interest in the project, small businesses on the Prequalified Sources List must also provide proof of sufficient bonding capacity. If the solicitation is issued as a small business set-aside (see para. 3 below), then proof of bonding capacity will have been used to demonstrate that the small business concern can responsibly compete.<br />3. After the specified closing date for receipt of interest, the Government will consider whether the "rule of two" is met per FAR 19.502-2(b) to determine if the project must be set aside for the small businesses on the list. If the "rule of two" is<br />met, then an IFB solicitation will be issued and if proceeding as a small business set-aside, only prequalified small businesses would be eligible for a contract award.<br />4. Per FAR 36.103(a), Contracting Officers shall use sealed bid procedures for a construction contract if the conditions in 6.401(a) apply. Therefore, the Government will consider if:<br />a. Time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;<br />b. The award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;<br />c. It is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding offerors about their bids; and<br />d. There is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid.<br />5. SPK expects that these conditions will be met for most if not all contract actions contemplated for use with the PSL. However, in the event that one of these conditions is not met; or if it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to consider entering into discussions with offerors, then the Government reserves the right to issue Requests for Proposals (RFP) and follow procedures prescribed in FAR Part 15.<br />6. As it is expected that most if not all contemplated projects will proceed as FAR Part 14 acquisitions, the date of bid opening will generally be 30 days after issuance of an IFB.<br />7. The bid results will be made available to all bidders (i.e., those contractors on the PSL that actually submitted a bid - but not those contractors on the PSL that did not bid).<br />8. Upon identification of the apparent-low bid, the bid will be reviewed for conformity to the solicitation requirements (i.e., responsiveness) and contractor responsibility must be considered.<br />9. After an affirmative determination of contractor responsibility is made per FAR<br />9.104. The Government will proceed with contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Defense (DoD) Secure Access File Exchange (SAFE):</strong> Solicitations will be distributed via DoD SAFE to those contractors that indicated a positive interest in the project at hand and intent to bid using DoD SAFE.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE:  This is a second (2nd) modification to a previously-issued pre-solicitation notice for an upcoming acquisition of commercial Durable Medical Equipment (DME) services utilizing the procedures of FAR part 12   Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Subpart 13.5.   This notice synopsizing an upcoming competitive solicitation to satisfy the requirements of FAR 5.201 and 5.203.  This notice is NOT a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  Vendors should not submit quotations until the RFQ is posted to this website.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information resulting from this posting.

Previous modification addressed:

Change of Set-Aside
Update of Small Business Threshold for NAICS 621610

SERVICES:  Per 38 U.S.C. Part 17 the Dept. of Veterans Affairs is responsible for furnishing eligible beneficiaries DME for use in their home or nursing home.  The contractor shall furnish all equipment, labor, transportation and supplies required to provide delivery, pickup, setup/installation/assembly, reclamation (removal and return), training, storage and repair services for Government owned and Government issued DME for VA Medical Center Beneficiaries within one or more specific Veteran Integrated Services Network (VISN) 15 s eight (8) VA Medical Center systems St. Louis VA Medical Center system is made up of two (2) VAMCs   John Cochran (St. Louis, City of) and Jefferson Barracks VAMC (St. Louis, County of)
 service areas.  An indefinite quantity of services will be furnished at such times and in such quantities as required, FOB destination.  

ACQUISITION:  The VA intends to release this as a competitive RFQ on or about August 16, 2019. A single VISN wide solicitation will be issued.  The VA anticipates one or more awards that will be by facility or group of facilities.  The procurement will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The original pre-solicitation notice did not produce enough responses to issue the solicitation as a 100% Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 621610 with a size standard of $16.5 million.  The original pre-solicitation notice stated $15 million and has since changed.  Any resultant contract will be effective for a Base Period of performance of one year.  Four one-year option periods may be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Unless additional notice is given, or this notice is modified, the full RFQ will be posted to the Government-wide Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov).  All future information regarding this acquisition including amendments will be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

This modification addresses:

Provides a copy of the original Request for Information/Sources Sought document originally published in FBO.gov on 7-26-2019 under a different procurement reference number.
This pre-solicitation notice did not correctly associate the original Request for Information document issued as  36C25519Q0670  on 7-26-2019 (attached) to the pre-solicitation notice, issued as  36C25519Q0699  due to a system error.
This error is corrected by providing the attached copy of that document.
Potential sources are encouraged to complete the questionnaire and return it to michael.cumins@va.gov.
Note   the forthcoming solicitation will be enumerated as 36C25519Q0699, consistent with the Pre-Solicitation Notice.  36C25519Q0670 is no longer a valid reference for this procurement.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span><br />An important mandate of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is to develop new treatments for cancer. In a highly integrative approach, the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch (LYMB) of the NCI's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) utilizes recombinant molecules produced by NCI's Biopharmaceutical Development Program and commercial agents as potential immune system modulators. The LYMB Clinical Trials Team coordinates several phase I/phase II clinical trials under protocols that have been approved by the NCI's Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the study of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). The LYMB's current portfolio consists of the following protocols:<br />&bull; NCT01712659: "Phase I/II Trial Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Ruxolitinib in Patients with Smoldering or Chronic Adult T-Cell Leukemia (ATL)."<br />&bull; NCT02689453: "Subcutaneous Recombinant Human IL-15 (rhIL-15) and Alemtuzumab for People with Refractory or Relapsed Chronic and Acute Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL)."<br />&bull; NCT00001582: "Collection of Blood, Bone Marrow, and Tissue Samples for Investigation of the Human Immune Response, Lymphoma Biology and HTLV-1 Infection."<br />&bull; LOI: "Recombinant Human IL-15 (rhIL-15) and Mogamulizumab for Patients with Refractory or Relapsed Adult T-cell Leukemia and Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome."
<p>(Detailed information about each of the above listed trials is public information and can be accessed by visiting clinicaltrials.gov and searching by NCT number).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose.</span><br />The overarching goal of LYMB's clinical trials is to improve the understanding and treatment of ATL. ATL is a rare and highly aggressive lymphoproliferative disease that results from chronic infection with the retrovirus Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is most pervasive in the Caribbean basin-specifically Jamaica-where the majority of ATL cases reside. Access to this population is crucial to the success of LYMB's study; therefore, LYMB requires a contractor with a strong presence in Jamaica that is capable of effectively identifying, diagnosing and referring ATL patients to LYMB's protocols.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
   
Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

Description of Action: This proposed action is for award of a brand name firm-fixed price delivery order to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).
 
Description of Supplies or Services: VA, Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), Information Technology Operations and Services (ITOPS), Infrastructure Operations (IO), requires hardware and software maintenance for brand name International Business Machines (IBM) Power System E850 and E870 currently located at Quantico Information Technology Center (QITC) and Culpeper Disaster Recovery Site in support of the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The maintenance is required to ensure the existing hardware remains operational. The period of performance shall be September 6, 2019 through September 5, 2020 followed by four (4) 12-month option periods, if exercised. 

Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled,  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. 

Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited: Based on extensive market research, as described in section eight of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is available among authorized resellers of the brand name IBM software and hardware maintenance coverage as described in section three of this justification.  The current IO infrastructure is based on existing IBM hardware and software, for which VA requires support compatible with the existing infrastructure protocols and functionality for continued operational availability.  Only IBM or an authorized IBM reseller can provide the necessary software and hardware maintenance coverage, because of the requirement for patches and updates that are compatible with the existing propriety source code.   Only IBM or an authorized reseller of IBM, has access to the proprietary source code necessary to provide the updates to the existing IBM Power System.  No other source is capable of providing the required software and hardware maintenance that meets VA s unique functional requirements.  No other maintenance is compatible with or interoperable with the existing IBM software and hardware. The brand name IBM software and hardware maintenance coverage is the only software and hardware maintenance coverage that meets the Government s requirements. Failure to acquire would leave IO without the necessary maintenance that ensures the hardware remains optional. 

Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in section eight of this justification. This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements. Only IBM hardware and software maintenance can meet the Government s requirements.  It was determined, however, that limited competition is available among authorized resellers for this brand name hardware maintenance. In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A)(2), this Justification will be posted along with the solicitation to all contract holders on NASA SEWP.    

Actions to Increase Competition: In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for the requirements described herein, the agency will continue to perform market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be competed. 

Market Research: IBM Power System software and hardware maintenance and warranty are commercially available off-the-shelf packages currently in use in VA.  When conducting market research in May 2019 the Government s technical experts reviewed other brand OEM maintenance to ascertain if another vendor could provide maintenance to meet VA s requirements.  Specifically, VA technical experts reviewed Quality Associates Incorporated and GovLoop and determined their products do not meet VA s functional and interoperability requirements as outlined in paragraph 5 of this justification. Additionally, the technical experts reviewed other software and maintenance support vendors to determine if they could provide the required services. Based on the market research conducted, the technical experts confirmed that access to the required source code to issue the updates is proprietary and access to non-grey item parts is limited to authorized resellers of IBM software and hardware updates.  This maintenance is critical to ensure the IBM Power Systems Models E850 and E870 perform efficiently. No other vendors aside from authorized resellers of IBM have the capability of developing and issuing hardware maintenance coverage for IBM software and hardware necessary to support existing IO requirements. All of the products researched were unable to meet the functional requirements as stated in section 5 of this document. Only IBM software and hardware maintenance can meet the performance and functional requirements and integrate with existing installed hardware and software. Based on the above, only IBM software and hardware maintenance coverage meets the Government s requirements.

Additional market research was conducted by the Contract Specialist in July 2019 by utilizing the NASA SEWP Provider Lookup tool to determine whether the brand name IBM software and hardware coverage is available from NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.  It was determined that there are several authorized resellers, including 24 Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, of the brand name IBM software and hardware maintenance that hold current GWACs such that limited competition is anticipated.

Other Facts: None.
