<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for material and services to replace existing Invensys controllers with Trane DDC System including materials, engineering, installation and startup.
<p><br />NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Damuth Trane. Damuth Trane is the sole certified provider in this region that can integrate the existing building controllers, set-up the software and program the system to NASA specifications. The current workforce has received considerable training on Trane equipment, and switching to a different vendor would require re-training, additional time and expenses. This requirement is a continuation of legacy NASA updates to the same existing building management system. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide the required service and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on 10/17/2019. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>This project is located on the east shore of Lake Mohave above Davis Dam, in Arizona, within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The Katherine Landing (KL) Water Treatment Plant (WTP), located northwest of the Katherine Landing Developed Area, supplies potable water, fire water, as well as raw irrigation water for the developed area. Raw water is drawn from Lake Mohave by a raw water intake and pumping system. Lake Mohave has been contaminated with an invasive aquatic species (Quagga mussels). The mussels readily attach to nearly any surface, and interfere with the conveyance of water through the WTP as well as the raw water intake and associated piping.
<p>Facilities proposed to be constructed with this project include:</p>
<p>a) The removal, replacement and disposal of one raw water intake barge, with duplex alternating pumps; installation of flexible water supply line of EPDM rubber to convey water from the barge to the onshore connection point; installation of raw water pumps, UV disinfection equipment for destruction of the Quagga Mussel larvae, and all relative piping (piping, valves and fittings), power distribution equipment, piping and hydraulic control equipment, mounting hardware and deck fittings, demolition, removal and disposal of existing stairs and furnishing and installing new cast in place concrete stairs and handrail system. The installation of UV light treatment system housed within an l 8'Lx9'Wxl O'H shelter, constructed on a concrete pad, and located near the existing electrical panel and transformer.</p>
<p>b) The installation of aeration equipment in the existing 500,000 gallon concrete water storage tank for the removal of water disinfection byproducts. Work includes installation of aeration equipment in the tank, controls outside on the ground next to the tank, and approximately 7,800-ft of in ground conduit, conductors and control wire from power source to tank.</p>
<p>The entire project will be constructed under a single prime contract.</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the government, the contractor shall provide all services including labor, materials, facilities, tools, travel, and expertise (except as otherwise specified in the construction contract) necessary to construct the project described above.</p>

<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>

Contract payments will be based primarily on contingency fee payments for unsecured debt collection and firm-fixed prices for secured debt collection. Other direct costs and/or material costs may be reimbursed on an actual cost basis. It is projected that each contract awarded will have a period of five years from the date of award. The anticipated number of awards will be specified in the solicitation.</p>

Contract payments will be based primarily on contingency fee payments for unsecured debt collection and firm-fixed prices for secured debt collection. Other direct costs and/or material costs may be reimbursed on an actual cost basis. It is projected that each contract awarded will have a period of five years from the date of award. The anticipated number of awards will be specified in the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The Electronic Warfare Air/Ground Survivability (EWAGS) division of the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is currently working on hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing of optical sensors. Effective stimulation of the sensor requires the delivery of the right amount of light in the proper band. Known sources with stable output are essential, but in the case of a pulsed laser, the amount of light delivered might vary from pulse to pulse. Real-time monitoring of irradiance in this case is often accomplished with beam splitters or pick-off mirrors arranged to deflect a portion of the light to a fast detector. However, the use of a number of different single element detectors requires painstaking re-alignment each time.<br />EWAGS is investigating multi-wavelength power meters (MPM) to measure pulsed laser power and thereby monitor the irradiance falling on a sensor in real-time. Integrating such a device into the lab will create a system that is sensor agnostic, able to operate without re-alignment for any new sensor to be tested. One possible embodiment of such a device might be an integrating sphere with multiple output ports coupled to a modular set of detectors. By placing an appropriate bandpass filter in front of the detector, simultaneous measurements in multiple bands can be made.<br />EWAGS recognizes the technical challenges in developing MPM. The MPM must be capable of measuring laser pulses with frequencies on the order of 25 KHz. In order to do this, the detectors themselves must be very sensitive while simultaneously having a large dynamic range. The active area will likely need to be small, and any misalignments to the beam will impact the results. Measurement accuracy will be further compromised by the presence of speckle and other sources of noise (cooling may need to be applied at least in the infrared).<br />The focus of this effort is to develop an MPM that can be mounted to a motion table. The final package design should minimize size, weight, and power. It should be rigid enough not to flex under dynamic loads. In addition, the system should be able to tolerate small misalignments in the laser beam. The high frequency output signals will likely need to be shielded from crosstalk and other types of electromagnetic interference.<br />EWAGS is conducting this RFI to identify technology options and innovative approaches supporting multi-wavelength power meters (MPM) for HITL laboratory measurements.<br />

<DESC>FY22-27: Mortar Fire Control Systems (MFCS) and Operator New Equipment Training and Maintainer New Equipment Training (OPNET/MNET) services (Market Survey)
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify all potential qualified sources that are capable of providing a range of activities to include Mortar Fire Control Systems (MFCS) and Operator New Equipment Training and Maintainer New Equipment Training (OPNET/MNET) services starting in First Quarter (1Q) Fiscal Year (FY) 2022.</p>
<p>The MFCS Hardware elements consist of the M95/M96 MFCS (Mounted), the M150/M151 MFCS (Dismounted) and similar variants, digital aiming systems and similar variants, the M32/M32A1/M32A2 Lightweight Mortar Ballistic Computer (LHMBC) and similar variants, which consist of ruggedized military computers, displays (gunners and drivers), power distribution systems, power supplies, inertial navigation units, ruggedized mounts, and ruggedized cables. The Government will provide design information for each system hardware and instructions for soldier training with the release of the future RFP. A storage facility is required for this effort.<br />Item Descriptions: The following item descriptions describes the MFCS, storage facility, and OPNET/MNET services in sufficient detail to respond to this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>M95/M96<br />The MFCS-M M95/M96 is the Fire Control System for the current 120mm Vehicle Mounted Mortar Systems and Fire Direction Center (FDC) vehicles. The M95/M96 is fully integrated into the host vehicle. It provides mortar platoons with accurate, digitally integrated, and responsive indirect fire system capabilities. The capabilities of MFCS-M include position/navigation, weapon pointing (azimuth &amp; elevation), ballistic computation, communicate digitally with digital fire support systems including the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) and Forward Observer System (FOS) via combat-net radios.</p>
<p>M150/M151<br />The MFCS-D M150/M151 is the Fire Control System for the current M120A1 Towed Mortar System and FDC vehicles. The M150/M151 provides the same functionality of M95/M96 in a ground-mounted configuration. It is an add-on system to fielded 120mm mortar systems. It serves as a platoon level digitally integrated fire control system consisting of position/navigation, weapon pointing (azimuth &amp; elevation), ballistic computation, communicate digitally with digital fire support systems including the AFATDS and FOS via combat-net radios.</p>
<p>M32/M32A1/M32A2 LHMBC<br />The LHMBC provides warfighters the ability to compute fast and accurate ballistic solutions for the entire family of fielded U.S. mortars (60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortar systems) and their complete inventory of ammunition. With the LHMBC, soldiers are able to set up a mortar, calculate a fire control solution in under one (1) minute. The system can calculate up to six (6) simultaneous missions and three (3) final protective fires, act on priority targets, perform fratricide checks, execute check fire, calculate single safety fan with multiple segments, utilize digital meteorological data, and input/output digital variable message format messages from/to the AFATDS and the FOS.</p>
<p>Storage Facility<br />Storage of MFCS, LHMBC, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) (previous contract equipment that still requires storage), and other systems includes providing a storage facility that can store mortar product for the life of a five (5) year contract. The storage facility shall have climate control and be secured and monitored 24 hours per day and 7 days per week. Responsibilities at the storage location shall consist of formal inventory control using the government accountability systems (e.g. Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS), Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF),DoDI 5000.64 (Accountability and Management of DoD Equipment and Other Accountable Property), identifying, assembling, and kitting all items into fielding sets, i.e. assemblies, subassemblies, tools kits, and parts that make up each of the identified systems. The contractor's storage facility should be at least 7,000 square feet in order to store the MFCS, LHMBC, and GFE. Shipping of these products from the storage location to fielding sites for handoff and transfer of accountability will also be required.</p>
<p>MFCS Future Variants/System Improvements<br />Future variants may include, but are not limited to, Mortar Fire Control components modification and improvement, integration of MFCS onto a turreted mortar, the provision of digital fire control to the 81mm mortar and other weapon system applications. Potential modifications of the MFCS software capability will include updates to provide for implementation of those various functions. Modifications of hardware components may include an automatic fuze setter, interface, communication and control of a Precision Guided Mortar Munitions, target acquisition systems and devices.</p>
<p>New Equipment Training (NET) <br />Establish a New Equipment Training team and implement processes for providing the MFCS/M326 Mortar Stowage Kit (Quick Stow)/Mortar Weapons OPNET and MNET. These services will be performed in accordance with (IAW) the latest Programs of Instructions (POI). POIs will be provided by the Government at the time of RFP release. However, the contractor may need to update and maintain POIs to properly conduct training as required. All instructors will be certified by the U.S. Government. The contractor NET team is required to work in conjunction and under direction of the U.S. Government personnel during NET.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a 5-year Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/ Cost Reimbursement No Fee Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (with five one-year ordering periods covering the FY22-27 timeframe. The Government estimates that approximately 100 Mortar Fire Control Systems, 2790 LHMBC, 2000 Fire Control Computers (FCC), and 800 digital aiming systems may be purchased over a five year period along with various OPNET and MNET trainings.

Acquisition of this service does not involve the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information to the vendor
There may exist exposure to VA sensitive information, in particular to sensitive personal information (SPI) while implementing contractual services
Minimum Statutory Requirements

Prohibition on unauthorized disclosure:  Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA.  This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).  See VA Handbook 6500.6, Appendix C, paragraph 3.a.

Requirement for data breach notification:  Upon discovery of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access, the contractor/subcontractor shall immediately and simultaneously notify the COR, the designated ISO, and Privacy Officer for the contract.  The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  See VA Handbook 6500.6, Appendix C, paragraph 6.a

Requirement to pay liquidated damages in the event of a data breach: Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information.  If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above.  Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach.  The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data.   Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis.  Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

(1)  Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2)  Description of the event, including:
(a)  date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3)  Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4)  Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5)  Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6)  Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7)  The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(8)  Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9)  Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10)  Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11)  Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
 (1)  Notification;
 (2)  One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3)  Data breach analysis;
(4)  Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;

PHC's Commercial Contract: SPE4AX17D9412 was issued January 01, 2016 as a 5-year, fixed-price, requirements type contract (RTC) with no option periods. The contract is currently within the third year of the base period. The Next-Generation Contract: SPE4AX14D9413 was issued August 05, 2014 as a 10-year, fixed-price, IDIQ, long-term contract. The 10-year term consists of a 5-year base period and 5-year option period. The 5-year option period was exercised June 26, 2019. The contract is currently within the first year of the option period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br /><br />DLA aims to expand the scope of the contracts, which will include but will not be limited to Captains of Industry (COI) Supplier Capabilities Contract (SCC) and PBL support for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1. The COI-SCC concepts incorporate performance based supply chain management and logistics support in order to maximize the effectiveness of the contract and further expand the breadth of support provided by PHC in aid of DLA's objective to seek holistic logistics solutions. PBL support will enable the DoD to buy a level of support from PHC to support any one of its sole source end-items. A level of support is being used as a general term because it can vary depending on each requirement. <br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br /><br />Initiatives will involve identifying demand patterns and emergent needs for parts in various federal supply classes (FSC) which are only manufactured by PHC, and to place those items on contract through one of the three identified methods (Standard Consumable and DLR Spare Parts Support, COI-SCC or PBL Support) as demand warrants. As the program matures, and projects relating to the COI-SCC and PBL increments are more clearly identified, market research will be performed to ensure these subsequent phases are sole source to PHC. Market research techniques will include, but are not limited to, industry feedback, synopses, Requests for information (RFI), technical reviews and information obtained from the applicable Services regarding drawings and technical data rights. <br /><br /><br />Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the synopsis response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br /><br />PURPOSE: DLA desires to issue multiple contracts to Parker-Hannifin Corporation Aerospace and Industrial business entities to transform the existing / legacy contracts to COI-SCC and PBL projects to expand follow-on support. Any COI-SCC and PBL support projects identified will have their own unique contract number reflecting negotiated pricing and any unique requirements.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span><br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is intended to determine if any other entities are capable of supporting the proposed requirements.<br /><br /><br />OBJECTIVES: The overall objective of this effort is to achieve a predetermined level of support to include COI-SCC and PBL activities as identified. The potential provider's approach must seek to deliver an integrated performance package designed to optimize system readiness and reduce the total cost of ownership. Additional objectives of this initiative are as follows. <br /><br />1. Responsibility to reach and maintain a predetermined level of serviceable asset availability of identified parts and related components outlined by DLA through a collaborative partnership arrangement. <br /><br />2. Reduce the total cost of ownership versus DLA's current supply support model through innovation such as process improvement initiatives, reliability improvement initiatives, lean supply chain initiatives and other techniques.<br /><br />3. Supply engineering and technical support to complement DLA and Military Service cognizant engineering. <br /><br />4. Supplement organic depot maintenance manpower with contractor facilities and personnel, and perform overhaul of the assets to a degree that meets the requirement for end item supply availability, including:&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />-Work of a highly specialized and technical nature requiring tacit knowledge of a unique end-item with no known commercial variant or like item.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />-Utilize depot organic maintenance facilities as needed.<br /><br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">-Meet all source approval requirements.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span>

<SUBJECT>NASA/GSFC WFIRST Auto Collimating Flat (ACF) Request for Information
<SOLNBR>NASA-GSFC-WFIRST-ACF-RFI
<RESPDATE>103019
<CONTACT>Julie Anne Janus, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 3012864931, Email julie.a.janus@nasa.gov
<DESC>WFIRST Auto Collimating Flat (ACF) Request for Information<br />dated October 1, 2019&emsp;
<p>1	WFIRST Program Overview</p>
<p>The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is a mission responding to the 2010 National Research Council New Worlds, New Horizons (NWNH) Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey top priority recommendation in the large space mission category. The science program includes two dedicated investigations to tackle outstanding questions in dark energy research and exoplanet exploration, and includes a substantial General Observer program to enable targeted investigations of astrophysical phenomena to advance other goals from the Decadal Survey. A coronagraph instrument is included in the payload for purposes of advancing the present state of the art of coronagraph technology.</p>
<p>2	Procurement Overview</p>
<p>The WFIRST system is comprised of a 2.5-meter imaging system that operates at about 260K in order to allow imaging out to 2.0 microns. NASA plans to test the alignment of the imaging system using an auto collimating flat (ACF) operating near the telescope operating temperature. NASA has a limited space constraint for the test system so the space envelope for the ACF system will be limited. At this time, the total space envelope for the ACF system is 0.6m in the optical axis direction. We realize that this will drive an ACF mirror design that is thinner than would normally be expected for a mirror of this size and that this design constraint will further influence the mount design in order to insure an ACF surface figure at temperature meets the WFIRST requirements. The space envelope is very limited due to volume constraints; however, it is negotiable with NASA. We do not have a specific interface defined between the ACF system and the chamber at this time. It is expected that some three point bolted interface would be used.</p>
<p>This RFI is comprised of three basic areas of interest.<br />A)	Blank Procurement<br />The blank procurement would normally be an integral part of the procurement of the system. But due to schedule constraints, NASA may have to procure the mirror blank prior to the ACF contract finalization. So we are asking to break this part of the response out separately so that NASA understands the cost and lead time associated with this activity.</p>
<p>B)	Mounted ACF System (including mirror blank finishing)</p>
<p>NASA is currently in the process of trading between a full aperture 2.5m ACF and a sub-aperture, 1.5m ACF. Due to the size differences and space limitations, this size differential may lead to a different mount and test scheme for the fabrication and test. We also realize that the smaller ACF will be much easier to verify and would be preferable if the WFIRST requirements can be verified at the smaller size.</p>
<p>B.1) Mounted 1.5m Clear Aperture ACF<br />B.2) Mounted 2.5m Clear Aperture ACF<br />&emsp;<br />C)	ACF Thermal Control System</p>
<p>The ACF system will be installed in a high vacuum chamber surrounded by LN2 shrouds. A turn-key thermal control system will be required by to allow the ACF temperature and gradients to be controlled around a set temperature of 260K.</p>
<p>3	Supplier input is requested in the following section of the RFI.</p>
<p>3.1	ACF Blank Specification</p>
<p>Feedback on the parameters for the ACF blank are requested.</p>
<p>3.1.1	Diameter</p>
<p>Two lead times (1.5m and 2.5m) and costs will be associated with the response to this RFI.</p>
<p>As discussed in Section 2, two different ACF diameters are being considered by NASA at this time.</p>
<p>Notionally, the diameter of the mirror blanks should be slightly oversized from the blank provider. Recommendations for this oversize would be helpful since NASA has defined a clear, coated aperture of 1.5m and 2.5m. The mount scheme and edge effects will make the mirror blank larger than these values by some amount.</p>
<p>3.1.2	Thickness</p>
<p>The thickness of the blank will be 115mm (4.53") minimum. This is also a notional value and will have to be considered within the larger system space envelope introduced in Section 2.</p>
<p>3.1.3	Blank CTE</p>
<p>The blank material shall have a max CTE of &plusmn;0.05E-6/K at operating temperature.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis by NASA and Sigmadyne indicates that this CTE should be acceptable for this application. Homogeneity is critically important in order to control surface figure changes as the ACF cools to the operating temperature of 260K.</p>
<p>3.1.4	Surface finish</p>
<p>Ground surfaces are acceptable on all surfaces of the blank.</p>
<p>3.1.5	Surface quality</p>
<p>The blank surface shall be flat to 1mm or less</p>
<p>3.1.6	Front to back parallelism</p>
<p>The front to back surface of the blank shall be parallel to 5mm or less.</p>
<p>3.1.7	Roundness</p>
<p>The blank shall be round to within 10mm.<br />&emsp;<br />3.1.8	Break Edges</p>
<p>All blank edges shall have a hand break edge of 1mm minimum.</p>
<p>3.1.9	Inclusions and Fractures</p>
<p>There shall be no inclusions in the part that could create a live fracture during processing or operationally due to thermal changes.</p>
<p>The blank material shall not have any live fractures.</p>
<p>3.2	ACF Mechanical/Optical System</p>
<p>The response to this section will be in two parts. Part 1 will be with respect to a 1.5m clear aperture ACF and Part 2 will be with respect to a 2.5m clear aperture ACF. As noted earlier, due to the space limitations and effective stiffness of two configurations, the mounting scheme may differ between the two different sizes.</p>
<p>3.2.1	Nominal Configuration</p>
<p>Since the WFIRST system operates off-axis, the nominal configuration of the ACF will be with its surface perpendicular to gravity.</p>
<p>3.2.2	Space Envelope</p>
<p>As discussed in Section 2, the total space envelope being allocated to the ACF is 0.6m. This will include the ACF, the ACF mount, the Tip/Tilt actuation system, and the thermal control elements. Note that the space limitation is only in the axial direction.</p>
<p>The interface to the test configuration has not been defined at this time. It is assumed that there would be a three-point, hard bolted interface at the top of the 0.6m space envelope. Note that this interface is controlled and could impart strain into the ACF assembly during integration and cool-down. Recommendations regarding this interface would be welcomed.</p>
<p>3.2.3	System Mass</p>
<p>An allocation of 2,700kg (6,000 pounds) has been allocated to the ACF system. This is driven by the allowable chamber head loading. This is the current allocation and could be increased if needed by doing additional chamber analysis.<br />&emsp;<br />3.2.4	Surface Quality at the operating temperature</p>
<p>The mirror will operate at 260K. The requirements stated apply at this temperature including a maximum axial gradient of 0.3K.</p>
<p>The surface figure and figure stability are as follows:</p>
<p>Power, Peak to Valley	WFE (nm)<br />Absolute 	600<br />Knowledge	100<br />Stability	NA: budget under figure<br /> <br />Wavefront Error, RMS (static power removed) 	 <br />Absolute	25 Goal, 40 Required<br />Knowledge	 <br />Nominal Temp	15<br />Delta Over Temp Range	10<br />Total Over Angle and Temperature	20<br />Repeatability	 <br />Shipping/reconfiguring	10</p>
<p>Notes:<br />&bull;	The thermal control system will limit the axial gradient in the mirror to less than 0.3K<br />&bull;	Alternate thermal control schemes are acceptable as discussed in Section 3.3.</p>
<p>3.2.5	Coating</p>
<p>The ACF will be coated with a protected silver coating over the full 1.5m or 2.5m aperture (minimum).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the coating may extend to the OD of the mirror for thermal control reasons but there is no surface figure requirement outside the 1.5m or 2.5m diameter. A non-contact apodizer could be used to effectively mask off this area of the mirror surface.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />3.2.6	Mounting and Repeatability</p>
<p>The ACF mount is the major design consideration for this procurement. The mount should provide the following key features:<br />&bull;	Provides an interface between the mirror and the chamber<br />&bull;	The mirror mount interface should be repeatable such that the mirror can be installed, removed, and replaced with high confidence that the surface figure created during calibration at the supplier's facility is unchanged.<br />&bull;	The interface between the mirror and the mount should be capable of high vacuum environment operations over a large temperature range (survival 313K to 250K; operational 293K to 260K) <br />&bull;	If needed, it is acceptable to have through holes in the mirror within the clear aperture. These holes and resulting mount obstructions should be minimized in size. (Note: A proof of concept analysis has been completed by Sigmadyne that demonstrates a 9-point whiffletree design.)<br />&bull;	The surface figure requirements apply to the mirror in the mount at temperature.<br />&bull;	Repeatability should be demonstrated by test. It should be noted that this is repeatability of the assembly. This could be the ability to remove the mirror from the mount or the mirror/mount system removal from the support system. As discussed in Section 3.2.7, the system must be shipped to NASA and reconfigured with a demonstrated repeatability for surface figure.<br />&bull;	Some initial ideas/concepts are provided in Appendix A of this RFI. These are for reference purposes and should not be used as design direction.</p>
<p>3.2.7	Tip/Tilt Control and Range</p>
<p>The mirror mount shall provide the ability to remotely tip/tilt the mirror over a range of &plusmn;2.5 degrees with an incremental motion of 2.75 arcsec or less. In order to assess plate-scale, the commanded tip/tilt should be predictable to 2.75 arcsec and verified during verification testing.</p>
<p>No rotation or decenter adjustment is required.</p>
<p>3.2.8	Packing and Shipping</p>
<p>The mirror system will need to be transported from the supplier's facility to Greenbelt, MD and installed into the NASA Goddard vacuum chamber. As discussed earlier, this activity should not impact the surface figure verification as previously measured.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />3.3	Thermal Control System</p>
<p>The thermal control system is critical to the optimum performance of the ACF system. It can be assumed that cable feedthroughs will be provided as required by NASA in order to operate the system during optical testing.</p>
<p>The thermal control system should provide enough zones to allow the ACF performance to be tuned in real time as the thermal environment is further understood. An estimated number of harnesses and bundle sizes to be provided as part of the response.</p>
<p>The system should:<br />&bull;	Provide a thermal shroud for the back and sides of the mirror. Note that the shroud could extend over the front face, outside the clear aperture in order to minimize gradients.<br />&bull;	Likely the design will only have the low emissivity front face of the mirror exposed to the chamber environment. In Section 3.2.5 is was stated that the mirror could be coated outside the clear aperture.<br />&bull;	In addition to controlling the bulk temperature of the ACF, the real key to providing optimum and predictable performance is controlling the gradients in the ACF. The axial gradient will be the most important. Given this design constraint, are there other control algorithms that could be incorporated to minimize these gradients? For example, the 260K operating temperature is notional. Initial analysis by NASA shows that there is little heat transfer between the mirror and the telescope. So the actual bulk temperature of the ACF is not critical. A control law for the thermal control system may be to drive the axial gradient to near zero and allow the mirror temperature to float downward over time. The control scheme would require high homogeneity in the ACF material since CTE variations would cause surface figure errors over due to the transient nature of the bulk temperature.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />4	RFI Response Overview</p>
<p>The response to this RFI should be approximately 10 pages. The specific information is listed below:<br />&bull;	Comments regarding the mirror blank section. Material selection is expected to be a low CTE glass or glass ceramic material. Further insight into specific material(s) are welcomed.<br />&bull;	Comments regarding the mounting scheme envisioned. Note that the eventual RFP will not specify the mount, only the performance requirements. The proposed mounting technique will help inform NASA regarding the feasibility and mount sensitivity that would be expected. We realize that the space limitation will create a challenge for manufacturing and long term stability/repeatability.</p>
<p>One of the areas of concern is the repeatability of the mount. The ability to ship the system from the contractor's facility to Greenbelt, Maryland and install in the vacuum chamber while still relying on the original surface figure metrology.</p>
<p>The other area of concern is the thermal performance of the ACF. As the mirror cools in the mount, will strains be created that are not repeatable.</p>
<p>&bull;	A list of technical risks that potentially need to be addressed should be provided along with a mitigation plan.</p>
<p>&bull;	A cost and schedule WAG for the following:<br />o	Mirror blank procurement of a 1.5m or 2.5m blank as described in Section 3.1<br />o	ACF System Procurement<br />&#61607;	1.5m clear aperture system<br />&#61607;	2.5m clear aperture system<br />o	Thermal control system (Note that it is assumed that the TMS would be completed in parallel with the ACF system procurement and would be off the critical path) <br />Responses should be marked proprietary. Cost and schedule information can be provided in an addendum to the technical response.</p>

This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to Privacy Act information on a DoD computer/network.  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.  

Each contract health care worker providing services at a Navy command under this contract is required to obtain a Common Access Card.  Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, that contract health care worker will also require a successful investigation as detailed below.

CONTRACTORS SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE
The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractors Security Representative.
 Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Commands Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractors Security Representative.  The Contractors Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractors Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer.  

ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006  DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) and Navy implementing memorandum dated May 28, 2010 direct implementation of HSPD-12.
 This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  
Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contract health care workers working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a Common Access Card.


ACCESS TO DOD SYSTEMS
In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractors who require access to DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III.  This clause applies to contractors who require IT-II privileged access  to a DoN or  DoD unclassified computer/network; the IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI) .
 All contract health care worker positions under this contract require access to Privacy Act protected information and are therefore categorized as no lower than IT-II.  

PROCEDURES
To obtain a favorable determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed an interim Secret Clearance to be able to work on this contract.

Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access Privacy Act information on a DoD unclassified computer/network,  the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.
 The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.

When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employees duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Commands Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individuals performance under the contract.  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.
 The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. 

When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.  

The Contractors Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Command Security Manager.
 The Contractors Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Commands Security Manager.

These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employees anticipated date for reporting for duty.  The Navy Commands Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness and accuracy prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.
   An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF 86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.  If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Commands Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employees performance under the contract. 

The Navy Commands Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.
  Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a eligibility determination.  

DENIAL OF ACCESS
The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information.

INTERIM ACCESS
The Navy Commands Security Manager may authorize issuance of a CAC card and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the SF-86 questionnaire and advance fingerprint results.
 When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees working on the contract under interim access shall be removed immediately and will no longer be authorized to work on the contract.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RADNET Air Monitoring Program has requested Headquarter Acquisition Division (HQAD), Washington DC to issue this Sources Sought Synopsis Notice. This notice is a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this brand name requirement for Gusmer Custom made 4" polyester air filter discs. The Government will use the information obtained from industry for preliminary planning purposes. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 335210 with a small business size standard of 750 employees. Only firms who respond to this announcement by submitting the requested information will be considered in determining whether to set-aside this requirement for small business concerns. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS, OR BIDS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Sources Sought notice or any follow-up information. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice. The Government anticipates placing a firm fixed price supply order for 100,000 custom made 4" polyester air filters. Part #335019. The filters are crafted by Gusmer Enterprises Filters Materials Division in Waupaca, WI.

Any change in filter composition could invalidate evaluation of long-term trends in the data from the laboratory analyses of these air filters. Interested and qualified potential offerors should submit a capability statement which demonstrates their ability to provide the custom air filters within the timeframe and location identified above.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is releasing a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain responses from vendors and other interested parties on technologies and energy-saving services that can provide building load flexibility cost-effectively as part of a Grid-interactive Efficient Building (GEB) strategy.<br /><br /><br />GEBs provide an integrated approach for energy efficiency, renewable energy, storage, and smart technologies to coordinate building loads for cost reductions, continuous demand management and grid responsiveness.1 Buildings consume approximately 75% of U.S. electricity and drive peak generating capacity required by utilities; thus, GEBs are key to a clean, modern and cost-effective grid. Many electrical loads in buildings can be operated in a more flexible manner and, through advanced controls, can be managed to operate at specific times and at different output levels. GSA and DOE project that this capability and continuous demand management can provide solutions to peak demand issues, which will become increasingly valued by utilities over the next decade to provide grid stability.<br /><br />In accordance to FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of gathering information on new sustainable building technologies.

<p>BACKGROUND &amp; SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Background: The Charleston District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of firms to Repair TC Wharf at Joint Base Charleston. A comprehensive inspection was completed by an engineering firm, and the results are included as an attachment to this sources sought announcement.</p>
<p>The TC Wharf is composed of several different vintages, which include the TC Wharf, North Extension, West Addition, Train Trestle, North Ramp Addition, North Ramp, South Ramp and Center Ramp.</p>
<p>The original TC Wharf was constructed circa 1941 and extends from bent 1 to bent 101. The West Addition was constructed in two phases; however, the exact dates are unknown. Bent 182 to bent 199 was constructed after 1941, but prior to 1944. The remainder of the West Addition, bent 156 to 163, bent 170 to182 and bent 200 to 212 was constructed after 1944. The Train Trestle was constructed prior to 1944. The North Extension, bent 102 to 155, was constructed in 1955.</p>
<p>The TC Wharf and the North Extension are of similar construction. They are constructed of 18-inch octagonal plumb and batter piles with three different concrete pile caps, four different concrete beams and a concrete deck. The different vintages of the West Addition are of similar construction. They are constructed of 18-inch concrete plumb piles with a concrete pile cap, two different concrete beams and a concrete deck. The Train Trestle is constructed of 18-inch concrete plumb piles, concrete pile caps and a concrete deck. The Train Trestle is no longer used to support rail operations.</p>
<p>The primary fender system consists of foam filled fenders with concrete fender piles. The secondary fender system consists of steel fender piles with HDPE sleeves. Upgrades to the fender system were completed in 2006 and 2009. Various sized cleats and double bitts are located along the outboard face.</p>
<p>The North Ramp Addition was constructed in 2010 and is located north of the North Ramp. The section of the North Ramp Addition adjacent to the West Addition is constructed of 20-inch square concrete piles, with concrete pile caps and a concrete deck. The section adjacent to the North Ramp is constructed of 20-inch concrete piles and pile caps with concrete girders spanning the caps.</p>
<p>Access to the wharf is provided by the South Ramp, Center Ramp, North Ramp and a gravel ramp. The South Ramp is located between bents 164 and 169, and consists of concrete encased timber piles with concrete pile caps, concrete beams and a concrete deck. The timber piles are from the original construction in 1944 and were encased as part of a later repair project. The concrete elements are from the reconstruction of the ramp in 1963. The North Ramp was constructed in 2001. The ramp is constructed of concrete girders supported on concrete caps, supported by concrete piles. The majority of the underdeck elements are not accessible for inspection. The Center Ramp is a gravel ramp that was repaired in 2010. The repair project stabilized the ramp end to prevent loss of material, which was previously not retained. Steel sheet pile with a concrete cap was installed at the end of the ramp at the West Addition interface.</p>
<p>The South Fender Dolphin is composed of timber and steel piles secured with a steel wire wrap. The South Mooring Dolphin is constructed of steel piles and supports one mooring bollard.</p>

<p>This is not a solicitation for proposals but is for informational purposes only. A project agreement will not be awarded from this announcement.</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command, Warren, Michigan, in conjunction with the Product Manager Multi-Mission Protected Vehicle Systems (PdM MPVS) would like to invite interested members of the National Advance Mobility Consortium (NAMC) to participate in a Virtual Industry Day 06 November 2019 at 1000 EST. The purpose of the Industry Day is to discuss the upcoming requirement for the Cold Weather All-Terrain Vehicle (CATV), formally Joint All Weather All Terrain Support Vehicle (JAASV), and to hold a question and answer session.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to compete a prototype project for the CATV requirement on the Ground Vehicle System (GVS) Other Transactional Agreement (OTA), W15QKN-17-9-1025. The GVS OTA was awarded to the NAMC under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b.</p>
<p>NAMC will host a MEMBERS ONLY meeting in which it will present the requirement for the CATV prototype project. This event is open to NAMC Members ONLY.</p>
<p>The event will consist of the following:</p>
<p>1000-1200: Briefing session on the CATV Operation Requirement, Acquisition Strategy, Key Requirements, and Project Schedule</p>
<p>Questions will be accepted until end of briefing session to NAMC.ncms.org, and all answers are expected to be provided to the NAMC membership by COB on 20 November 2019.</p>
<p>The CATV will provide transportation for a combat-loaded Infantry-like squad element, emergency medical evaluation, command and control capability, and general cargo transportation; and be capable of operating on- and off-road under a wide range of otherwise impassable terrain for a small infantry squad with associated equipment that is globally responsive. The CATV will need to traverse rocky terrain, inland lakes, marsh and muskeg, deep snow, ice and operate in extreme cold weather (ECW). The CATV will be a high mobility tracked platform that will have a lightweight footprint and be transportable by a variety of means including vertical lift (via CH-47F) and air transportable (via C-17).</p>

<DESC>Purpose: In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section T3.2.2.4 - Single Source, the purpose of this announcement is to summarize the basis for the single source decision.

Nature of Procurement Action:
New, fixed price purchase order to Avitru, LLC for 35 MasterSpec annual site licenses.  This would be a single year license which will require a new award for future years.  These 35 licenses will allow users at each of the FAAs engineering service locations to utilize the MasterSpec software to develop procurement specifications for their Facilities & Equipment funded projects.

Description of Supplies/Services:
MasterSpec software is the industry standard specification resource for engineering design.  The American Institute of Architects partnered with Deltek + Avitru to develop the software and provide editing capability to fine-tune the standard specifications to match a specific design. Air Traffic Control Facilities and Engineering Services (AJW-2) complete over 2,000 projects per year, many of which require some level of engineering design and procurement.   Utilizing a standard specification software has been identified by the FAA as a method to improve the quality and speed of our project related contract awards.

Authority:
Authority for single source procurement is provided by AMS policy section 3.2.2.4.

Rationale Supporting Use of a Single Source:
Deltek +Avitru is the sole source provider of MasterSpec specifications system, a product of the AIA (American Institute of Architects).  Deltek +Avitru is the sole provider authorized and contracting with the AIA to produce, maintain and distribute this product. MasterSpec is the industry standard format for specifications system construction specifications.  The Format utilizes industry recognized divisions for MasterFormat2018, including SpecText.  

Without this product, the FAA would modify specifications that were produced for other projects by FAA contractors.  Using this method to produce project specifications is costly to the FAA as the specifications have not been tailored to the specific project we are preparing. Without this product, FAA engineers will not have a standard to tailor specifications for FAA specific projects.  The Deltek +Avitru MasterSpec product has been used with individually purchased licenses for several years by AJW-2 engineers, and the users are familiar with the editing software that is provided by Deltek +Avitru.  This procurement would eliminate the need for multiple purchases and allow all AJW-2 engineers access.

NASA's Technology Transfer Program solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.&nbsp; License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.&nbsp; <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses</strong>.
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Copper replaced aluminum early two decades ago as an interconnect material in integrated circuit manufacturing due to its better electrical and thermal conductivity. Metallic nanowires have interesting physical properties such as quantized conductance and localization effects.&nbsp; These properties can be exploited for applications such as wiring in nanometer scale circuits, and probes for atomic force microscope and scanning tunneling microscope.&nbsp; NASA has developed a new technology that can produce copper nanowires directly.&nbsp; This technology provides a simple method to produce copper nanowires on a substrate as an alternative to template approaches and chemical synthesis routes.&nbsp; Copper oxide nanowires (CuOandCu2O) are produced from copper film, foil, or commercially available copper wires of any size, through oxidation using a vapor phase technique known previously.&nbsp; The copper oxide nanowires are then reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere to produce the copper nanowires.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>To express interest in this opportunity, please submit a license application through NASA's Automated Technology Licensing Application System (ATLAS) by visiting <strong>https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/TOP2-163</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>If you have any questions, please contact Ames Research Center <strong>ARC-TechTransfer@mail.nasa.gov</strong> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.&nbsp; For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <strong>https://technology.nasa.gov/</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>These responses are provided to members of NASA's Technology Transfer Program for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities.&nbsp;<strong> No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice</strong>.</div>

<div><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NASA's Langley Research Center has developed a new adhesively bonded joint concept for curved and flat panel sandwich architectures.&nbsp; A woven preform, inserted into the seam between sandwich panels, provides a larger total bonding area and multiple load paths for an improved distribution of load through the joint.&nbsp; NASA is able to create structures by joining sections of sandwich panels or curved shells.&nbsp; The new joint provides more durable load transfer and redundant load paths compared to current state-of-the-art adhesively bonded strap joints.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NASA is developing next generation launch vehicles that will be based on high-performance composite materials and innovative manufacturing methods.&nbsp; As such, NASA uses adhesively bonded joints where possible, instead of mechanically fastened (bolted) joints, to design and manufacture structures.&nbsp; The adhesive joints are typically lighter and distribute loads more efficiently across an interface, while mechanically fastened joints are prone to stress concentrations around the bolts.&nbsp; The new durable redundant joint (DRJ) offers improved safety and load carrying capability for sandwich structures when compared to conventional H-type joints.&nbsp; The DRJ uses a composite preform to connect two ends of a curved, composite sandwich panel to form, for example, a cylindrical vehicle segment.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows the cross sections of two adhesively bonded joints--the single and the DRJ, including the preform.</div>

<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NASA's Langley Research Center researchers have a strong technology foundation in the use of electron-beam (e-beam) deposition for free-form fabrication of complex shaped metal parts.&nbsp; While e-beam wire deposition is of interest for rapid prototyping of metal parts, cost-effective near-net shape manufacturing, and potential use in space, it is also of intense interest for industrial welding and fabrication in a range of applications, from small components to large aerospace structures.&nbsp; Through significant advancements in techniques to improve control of the process, NASA greatly expands upon the capabilities of the e-beam fabrication and welding process.</div>
<div><br />The technology employs rastering of the e-beam in the region of the wire and substrate melt zone.&nbsp; By controlling the raster pattern, the e-beam selectively heats the outer edges of the wire as it strays from the melt zone.&nbsp; With such selective heating, the wire automatically curls back away from the high heat outer edge and back into the region of the molten pool.&nbsp; Thus, with a fixed raster pattern, the process becomes self-correcting without any sensing or external control of process parameters.</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />Researchers at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center have developed a novel method for interim, in situ dimensional inspection of additively manufactured parts.&nbsp; Additive manufacturing processes currently have limited monitoring capabilities, offering users little to no options in mitigating the high levels of product and process failures.&nbsp; This technology uses both infrared (IR) and visual cameras that allow users to monitor the build in real-time and correct the process as needed to reduce the time and material wasted in parts that will not meet quality specifications.&nbsp; The technology is especially useful for the in-process inspection of a parts internal features (e.g., fluid channels and passages), which cannot be easily inspected once the print is complete.&nbsp; The technology has the potential to enable the implementation of a closed-loop feedback system, allowing systems for automatic real-time corrections.</div>

<div>Researchers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center have developed new, modular fixtures for holding metal in place during the assembly and welding of cylindrical and conical sections of rocket bodies.&nbsp; Previous methods required time-consuming design, fabrication, and assembly of expensive, project-specific fixtures, which often required up to 6 months of lead time and cost millions of dollars to complete.&nbsp; NASA's modular fixtures are designed to be adjustable and to easily form different fixture body configurations for rocket sections with various diameters and heights.&nbsp; This improved setup efficiency allows for a more rapid shift from one project to the next, reducing the time a newly designed fixture body is complete, allowing welding to begin in a matter of weeks rather than months.&nbsp; NASA is currently seeking licensees that may benefit from modular fixtures in large-scale manufacturing.</div>

NASA's Technology Transfer Program solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.&nbsp; License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.&nbsp; <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses</strong>.
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center is developing an improved joining technology called thermal stir welding that improves upon fusion welding and friction stir welding. This new technology enables a superior joining method by allowing manufacturers to join dissimilar materials and to weld at high rates.&nbsp; NASA's technology offers users an exciting alternative to state-of-the-art fusion and friction stir welding technologies.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NASA's new thermal stir technology addresses shortcomings in fusion welding and friction stir welding.&nbsp; Fusion welding compromises the microstructure of the material and thus lessens its physical properties.&nbsp; Friction stir welding is limited by the dependent heating and stirring functions when using a rotating shoulder/pin configuration.&nbsp; The shoulder produces frictional heat to bring the material into the plastic state and forges the welded material with extremely large forces.&nbsp; This forging effect requires a very robust backing anvil for support.&nbsp; The welding pin, inside the workpiece, spins at the same rate as the shoulder, further restricting the process.&nbsp; This dependent motion of the welding pin and shoulder restricts the speed of the welding process.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The thermal stir process separates the characteristic heating and matrix transformation processes of the friction stir welding process.&nbsp; It can use a fusion welding apparatus (laser, plasma torch, etc.) to initially melt the material.&nbsp; It may also use a solid state heating process such as induction resistance heating.&nbsp; If a fusion heating apparatus is employed to heat the material, a separate grinding/extrusion feature recrystallizes the resulting dentritic matrix structure as it transforms from the melted temperature state through the plastic temperature state.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The heat sources that melt each material of the weld joint can be independently controlled.&nbsp; For example, a copper/aluminum weld joint can have independent temperature control as each alloy is brought into its respective plastic and melting states.&nbsp; This independent melting feature is advantageous because it provides a thermal environment conducive to the joining of dissimilar metals, such as copper and aluminum or stainless steel and titanium.&nbsp; Because these independent heat sources are kept separate from the weld matrix transformation feature (the grinding/extrusion teeth), higher weld travel rates are possible as compared to fusion and friction stir welding processes.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Unlike friction stir welding, this technology requires no backing anvil.&nbsp; The apparatus used for the weld process is enclosed in a main housing, which allows for the possibility of an inert environment in the melting compartment if needed.</div>

<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) developed Ultrasonic Stir Welding (USW) to join large pieces of very high-strength metals such as titanium and Inconel.&nbsp; USW, a solid-state weld process, improves current thermal stir welding processes by adding high-power ultrasonic (HPU) energy at 20 kHz frequency.&nbsp; The addition of ultrasonic energy significantly reduces axial, frictional, and shear forces; increases travel rates; and reduces wear on the stir rod, which results in extended stir rod life.&nbsp; The USW process decouples the heating, stirring, and forging elements found in the friction stir welding process allowing for independent control of each process element and, ultimately, greater process control and repeatability.&nbsp; Because of the independent control of USW process elements, closed-loop temperature control can be integrated into the system so that a constant weld nugget temperature can be maintained during welding.</div>

<a href="mailto:Jameel.Gordon@va.gov">Jameel.Gordon@va.gov</a>
<DESC>Pittsburgh VAMC Surgical Service Line is seeking a Comprehensive Data Cleanse and Asset Optimization Implementation for surgical trays used in the operating room.  Surgical trays are they key component of the Surgical procedure and contain all the instrumentation needed to perform surgery. Within the next 2 months, the Pittsburgh VAMC will be implementing Censitrac Surgical Fleet Tracking system that will help properly track Surgical trays and contents within the trays throughout the Hospital and Sterilization process. Censitrac is a mandatory being implemented through all VAMC s. It is imperative to get the Optimization process started prior to the aggressive timeline for implementation of Censitrac to avoid inputting inaccurate tray information.

This request is for the TrillaMed/Aesculap (TrillaMed) Comprehensive Data Cleanse and Asset Optimization Implementation. This is a four-step process that is designed to balance clinical and financial outcomes. TrillaMed has already completed Phase 1 of the QuickScan back in Sept 2018, and the remaining phases are required to implement the changes. TrillaMed will provide real expertise along with the surgical team at the VA to improve lifecycle of surgical tray inventory and instruments. This is a one-time service that will allow TrillaMed to come in and work on the project over a period of up to 120 days.

Based on the results of market research (to include a sources sought).There is no other vendor that offers this in-depth manual optimization program found other than TrillaMed. TrillaMed has already completed Phase 1 of the QuickScan back in September 2018, there are additional phases remaining that are required to implement the changes.Most of our instrumentation in the surgical trays are of Aesculap brand allowing for a seamless swap of instrumentation that is noted in the phase 2 assessment of the surgical trays.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The suffix is assigned at the discretion of the Offeror to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative EFT accounts (see subpart 32.11) for the same entity. If the Offeror does not have a unique entity identifier, it should contact the entity designated at www.sam.gov for unique entity identifier establishment directly to obtain one. The Offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the entity designated at www.sam.gov for establishing the unique entity identifier. <br />(k) Reserved. <br />(l) Debriefing. If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: <br />(1) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. <br />(2) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. <br />(3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. <br />(4) A summary of the rationale for award; <br />(5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. <br />(6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.212-2, EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) Past performance and (ii) Price (see FAR 15.304); and include them in the relative order of importance of the evaluation factors, such as in descending order of importance.)<br />Past Performance is equal to price.<br />Past Performance. This consists of two parts. Offers are to provide a summary of past work within these areas: <br />- Relevance - Relevance addresses how closely past work associates with the current requirement. <br />- Recency - Performance older than 3 years may not be rated as highly as performance in the past year. <br />There is no minimum number of projects or contracts to be listed. Provide narrative regarding the size of the requirements (scope and dollar magnitude) and to the kind of customer (military, etc...). References are encouraged. <br />Relevance will be judged on the following scale:<br />Past Performance Relevance Ratings<br />Rating Definition<br />Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Based on evaluation results of the 2 Past Performance Subfactors, the Past Performance Factor will be assigned one of the following Performance Confidence Assessments:<br />Performance Confidence Assessments<br />Rating Definition<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Neutral No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be assigned. The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Price. While price is an important factor, it is not more important than Past Performance. Price must be reasonable and it must reflect market pricing. Pricing that is too low may be deemed as unrealistic, and could be interpreted to mean the offeror does not account for all of the cost implications of the work.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)<br />The following clauses below applies to this acquisition:<br />52.203-18 Prohibition on Contracting With Entities That Require Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements--Representation JAN 2017 <br />52.204-3 <br />52.204-7<br />52.204-9 Taxpayer Identification <br />System for Award Management<br />Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel OCT 1998<br />OCT 2018<br />JAN 2011 <br />52.204-24 Representation Regarding Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification to contract N00019-19-C-0083 for Military-Code (M-Code) development effort to include post-Critical Design Review (CDR) through the completion of Engineering and Manufacturing Design (EMD). NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missiles Systems (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337 (Point of Contact for Small Businesses interested in subcontracting &ndash; Matt DePiero &ndash; (520) 663-8839). Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV and Block V AUR missile, and is the only source capable of performing the required integration and testing. RMS maintains and controls both the Level III technical data package (TDP) and the manufacturing documentation for the Block IV and Block V AUR. Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV and Block V AUR missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RMS is the only known source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs. The data associated with the Tomahawk missile is export controlled and is not available to foreign sources or representatives. Responsible parties may submit capability statements which shall be considered. This is not a request for proposals.

Brooks &amp; Perkins, Inc., a HUBZone entity, performed the previous manufacturing effort under order number N61331-12-D-0002 and N61331-17-P-0074 on a competed basis, the government receiving only one responsible offer. The government expects delays in schedule and duplication of costs through competition because this HUBZone entity possesses the knowledge, tooling, and equipment necessary to manufacture these items providing the government the best value based on price and delivery due to the experience gained through the previous efforts. Therefore, it is in the government's best interest to award on a HUBZone sole source basis to Brooks &amp; Perkins, Inc. because it meets all<br />guidelines prescribed under FAR 19.1306(a), and the government will award at a fair and reasonable price.<br />5. A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order<br />represents the best value consistent with FAR 13.501.<br />The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs.<br />6.

A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.<br />As stated in paragraph 4 above, Brooks &amp; Perkins, Inc is the only entity that can meet this<br />requirement.
<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /> <br /> - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br /> - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br /> - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br /> - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br /> - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br /> - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section G  252.232-7006, 252.232-7003</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The contractor shall fill out a unit price, the extended price and a total price for all CLINs.  Please ensure that all prices, extended prices and total prices are checked and verified for accuracy.  DO NOT go two (2) digits beyond the decimal point.      <br />(4) In accordance with FAR Part 9, Contractor Qualifications, past performance information will be used to determine whether an offeror has a satisfactory performance record to determine whether the offeror is a responsible contractor eligible for contract award.<br />An offeror determined to have an unsatisfactory performance record will be determined non-responsible, therefore, the offeror will not be eligible for contract award.<br />In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>The Government has a right to retrieve additional past performance information through the Government's past performance databases, Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).</p>

Failure to RSVP by 10 October 2019 at 3:00 pm PST will result in no access to site visit on day of site visit.  Please e-mail rommel.delmundo@us.af.mil to RSVP for the site visit.</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>Award will be made to the Offeror whose Acceptable Technical Proposal represents the Best Value to the Government.  Best Value will be determined by the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable proposal.  Offers will be rated by technical acceptability and award will be made to the lowest priced offer.</p>
<p>(1) The evaluation team will evaluate each offer on its merits and assign one of the following ratings to each offer.</p>
<p><br /> <br />Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings</p>
<p>Rating	Description<br />Acceptable	Offer clearly meets the requirements of the Solicitation and the Requirements Description.<br />Unacceptable	Offer does not clearly meet the requirements of the Solicitation and the Requirements Description.</p>
<p>Price.  The Government shall conduct a price evaluation of all offers.  The Government will evaluate an offer by adding the total price for all CLINs.  The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair, reasonable and realistic price.  Evaluation of prices will determine if they are compatible with the scope of the effort, are not unbalanced and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.  It is expected that the competitive nature of this acquisition will drive price reasonableness and fairness; however, the Government reserves the right, if it deems appropriate, to make these determinations by means of one or more price analysis techniques.</p>
<p>a.	Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR Part 9.1, whose offer conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this RFQ) and is judged, based on the evaluation to represent the best value offer.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award 1 (one) contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p>While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>b. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

Facility Access and Security
Contractor personnel shall satisfy all security requirements as specified below.  Failure to meet these requirements within a reasonable time period, unless otherwise explicitly specified, will be grounds for suspension or termination of al building and/or computer privileges and removal from work on this Contract until such time as the requirement is fulfilled.

Contractor personnel requiring unescorted physical access to the Government facilities will be required to submit personal identifying information (full legal name (first, middle, and last), date of birth, state-issued driver's license or identification card number and the state that issued it, and name as it appears on the card) and may be subject to a criminal history check.  Visitors who are not subjected to the criminal history check will be escorted at all times by someone who has been issued a permanent Government Identification Badge.  The cost of conducting the criminal history check is the responsibility of the Government.  The contractor shall pre-screen all personnel requiring physical access to the property to ensure they are legally able to work in the U.S. and are not currently sought by law enforcement authorities.  Adjudication of information discovered during or after the criminal history check is solely the responsibility of the Physical Security Officer.

Contractors must provide signed certification of completion to the COR during each year of the Contract.  This requirement is in addition to any other training that may be imposed by the Government.

When contractor personnel are on-site at the Government facility, contractor personnel shall follow all established regulations, policies and standard operating procedures applicable to the facility.  Violations of Government regulations and policies may result in the contractor's personnel being removed from the premises and may result in termination of the Contract for default.  The Government shall not be responsible for any of the contractor's costs for replacement of personnel removed from the premises for reasons associated with safety, security, and unprofessional or inappropriate conduct.

The contractor shall obtain all necessary licenses and/or permits required to perform the work.  The contractor shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect persons and property from injury or damage during the performance of this Contract.

Failure to complete the work by the required completion date, caused by delays in requesting security clearances, or due to revocation of access privileges resulting solely from the actions of the contractor or their personnel, is not sufficient reason to warrant an extension in the Contract time or amount.

The Government reserves the right to order contractor personnel off the premises and take other security precautions in the event of an emergency, Government shutdown, times of elevated security risk, or any other reason deemed necessary by Government management or security staff.  Contractor personnel must immediately leave the site and may not return until authorized by the COR.

Only business directly related to this Contract may be conducted at the Government facility.  Contractors may only be on-site when conducting business actually associated with the performance of this Contract.

The contractor, when notified of an unfavorable determination by the Government, shall withdraw the employee from consideration from working under this Contract.

<p>This announcement is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> a request for proposals. Contractors shall not submit proposals in response to this notice.</p>
<p>Proposed Solicitation Number: W91CRB-19-R-0066 (revised to W91CRB-20-R-0001)</p>
<p>Estimated Solicitation Issue Date: On or about 15&nbsp;November 2019 with all documents, attachments and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov. No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued. Respondents are responsible for obtaining the documentation from the stated website.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this requirement on a full and open basis using the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will provide MSVs as part of the overall SPS TEP system, which provides the Soldier with a lightweight, modular, scalable, mission specific protective equipment system to maximize protection and mobility; allowing field commanders and Soldiers to select the personal protective equipment tier best suited for the planned mission. The MSV component consists of a concealable vest, which includes a cummerbund with two soft armor panels (one front and one back) covered in a camouflage cloth with hook and loop. In addition, MSV includes two side plate pockets with two side soft armor panels, and a tactical outer carrier which includes side plate pocket carriers and shoulder straps. The soft armor panels can be augmented with hard armor protective inserts or can be inserted into the tactical outer carrier that also accommodates hard armor protective inserts. The MSV is the base component of the TEP and it can be configured to provide varying degrees of Soldier protection while reducing weight to the greatest extent possible. The MSV is the basis of the TEP system Tiers 1 through 4.</p>
<p>The scope of work for this requirement includes all procurement and production activities necessary to manufacture the carrier, soft armor ballistic package, and other materials that constitute the SPS TEP MSV. To meet this immediate requirement, the Government intends to award&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;five (5) firm fixed price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts via a competitive acquisition on a best value trade off basis. Subsequent to contract award, delivery orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity procedures described at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 16.505.<br /><br />Period of Performance: Five year ordering base followed by two, 2-year options (additional ordering periods)<br /><br />Contract Minimum includes the Pre-First Article Testing/Technical Data Package and First Article Testing items.<br /><br />Quantity (The following quantities are estimates): Base (Years 1-5)&nbsp;874,000 eaches, Option&nbsp;1 (Years 6-7)&nbsp;250,000 eaches, Option&nbsp;Year 2 (Years 8-9)&nbsp;250,000 eaches and, any spares and technology insertion (estimated quantities pending). <br /><br />Draft copies of the&nbsp;Purchase Description and patterns for this requirement may be requested via the FBO website. As part of the request process, vendors must complete the "Draft Access-Vendor Questionnaire" and submit it to the POC listed for this post. Document requests via phone WILL NOT be honored.</p>

<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DON) anticipates availability of non-excess real property at JBPHH, Hawaii, for potential future lease under the authority of Title 10, United States Code &sect; 2667.<br /><br />This RFQ for outlease and development of underutilized, non-excess property aboard JBPHH is made in furtherance of objectives outlined in SECNAVINST 4101.3A.
<p>In order to achieve energy resiliency for JBPHH and the island of Oahu, it is expected that approximately 100MW of resilient capacity is required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To meet that expected requirement, the Navy envisions allowing capacity to be commercially generated and/or stored on DON property,&nbsp; The proposed sites ("Sites") consist of five (5) parcels of improved land on JBPHH totaling approximately ten (10) acres of land each for four (4) parcels known as Sites 1, 2, 3 and 4; approximately (17) acres of land for parcel identified as Site 5, and one (1) parcel of approximately ninety (90) acres on West Loch Annex adjacent to the existing West Loch Phase I solar facility known as Site 6, for a total of six (6) Sites (see Section 6).&nbsp; For purposes of this RFQ the Government is not redeterminging potential configurations of Sites for respondents.&nbsp; As such, respondents are expected to determine the optimal Site(s) or cobinations of Sites to develop projects that meet JBPHH (Installation) requirements for energy resiliency.&nbsp; Responders may request to utilize Site 6 and Site 5 and one (1) of Sites 1-4, not to exceed three (3) sites total.&nbsp;&nbsp;Responses which request more than three (3) sites, or more than one (1) Site at locations 1-4 would not qualify.<br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><br />Clarification - The requirement is S100MW of resiliency capacity.&nbsp; 100MW cannot be obtained on the land available just using Solar.&nbsp; Solar alone is not recommended for the smaller sites 1 - 5, only for the Westloch site.&nbsp; Other forms of generation would also have to be considerd for Sites 1-5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any response to qualify technically, the response would need to offer a solution that provides for at least 100MW of resilient capacity.&nbsp; Any response that does not meet that minimum standard will not qualify.&nbsp;<br /><br />For the qualification factor for National Security, any response that does not provide the Entity name of any partners, financiers, equity providers etc., may initially be pre-qualified if the respondent themselves pass for qualifications.&nbsp; However, further review for National Security will be performed at the time of any potential RFP.&nbsp; If any partners, financiers, equity providers etc., are found to be at high risk, or if further information is provided on the prime respondent that puts them at high risk, that respondent will not qualify for selection.</p>

DISREGARD INITIAL RFQ AND UTILIZE THE RFQ DATED 10/09/2019 WHICH :<br /><br />PROVIDES CLARIFICATION ON USE OF SITES, AND QUALIFING FACTORS

<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts. CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification. This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended. FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy: adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems. Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /><br />Information Safeguards<br /><br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a. Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b. Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c. Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system. However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /><br />a. Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b. Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c. At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d. Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e. Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /><br />f. Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g. Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /><br />h. Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j. Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /><br />(1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /><br />(2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k. Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l. Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information: facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br />- Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br />- Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br />- Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br />- Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br />- Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br />- Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br />- Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /><br />- Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br />- Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br />- Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br />- Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br />- When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br />- During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

<DONBR>HSTS03-15-F-CIO500
<MODNBR>P00009
<DESC>(i) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Limited Source Justification."
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Acquisition (OA), on behalf of the Office of Information Technology, Focused Operations branch, has awarded modification P00009 to the task order, HSTS03-15-F-CIO500 using a Logical Follow on Exception to fair opportunity pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), Limited Sources. The acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program</p>
<p>(ii) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>OA has limited the number of sources solicited, pursuant to the above, to modify the Order, which was awarded to Attain, LLC (Attain) for computer network defense services in support of TSA's security operations command. The task order must be modified to provide continuous monitoring and risk mitigation services for TSA's focused operations branch. Attain, LLC is located at 1600 Tysons Blvd Ste 1400, McLean VA 221024893</p>
<p>(iii) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).</p>
<p>Attain, LLC will provide support services and engineering for the computer network defense and cybersecurity tool set used by TSA OIT's focused operations (FO) branch for forensic investigations associated with the operation TSA's IT defenses. The support services will assist TSA with the continuous monitoring and risk mitigation functions provided by the FO branch. These tools and services also contribute to TSA's continuous diagnostics mitigation (CDM) and continuous monitoring as a service (CMaaS) functions within the overall cyber defenses for TSA's IT. The total value of this ceiling increase is $576,228.00. There is no change to the period of performance for the overall task order. The total task order value will remain at $60,235,028.48.</p>
<p>(iv) The authority and supporting rational (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i) and (b)(1)) and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.</p>
<p>8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued using sole source or limited sources procedures. <br />Rationale: The order was awarded as a result of competition under General Services Administration, Schedule 70, "General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software and Services" pursuant to FAR 8.405, "Ordering Procedures for Federal Supply Schedules." The modification will add the additional work required for TSA's cyber security defenses. Attain LLC is the best source to provide these services in the interest of economy and efficiency. The scope of the services fits within the computer network defense task order scope. Attain is the most economical choice as it has the TSA cleared direct labor that can provide the required work. It would not be cost effective for TSA to retain an additional provider for these services as the efforts would be inherently redundant. Issuing this task order modification ensures the timely delivery of the mission critical cyber defense services and leverages the current efficiency and effectiveness of the existing task order. The work being added as a result of the modification does not alter the type of services received, but rather it increases the volume in this particular area of the cyber defenses for TSA. It is not in the best interest for the Government to further compete this requirement in lieu of leveraging the existing task order for this work.</p>
<p>(v) A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d).</p>
<p>The contracting officer determined that the proposed modification represents the best value, is the most efficient, and will result in the lowest overall cost, considering price and administrative costs, to meet the Government's needs. The order was placed in accordance with FAR 8.404, Use of Federal Supply Schedules". As a result of using these procedures, TSA recognizes that GSA previously negotiated fair and reasonable pricing rates.</p>
<p>(vi) A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>The previous vehicle that could have been used for these services has recently expired. TSA previously issued a separate BPA call against the GSA DHS CDM CMaaS BPA to provide the aforementioned services. The BPA was not reissued and is no longer available. TSA also considered the NITAC NIH CIO-SP3 unrestricted vehicle and issued a solicitation via the "e-GOS" system for these services. However, at the close of the solicitation, TSA did not receive any responses. Based on the unavailability of the DHS GSA CDM CMaaS BPA, and the lack of interest from CIO SP3 unrestricted contractor pool, the most efficient and economical approach is to leverage the existing computer network defense task order.</p>
<p>(vii) Any other facts supporting the justification.</p>
<p>There are no additional supporting facts.</p>
<p>(viii) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.</p>
<p>TSA OIT FO will continue to research the marketplace for potential providers for these specialized computer network defense services.</p>
<p>(ix) The ordering activity contracting officer's certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>The notice to post this requirement on fbo.gov will be executed pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(2).</p>
<p>(x) Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or requirements or other rationale for limited sources) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(c)(2)(x), I certify that this requirement meets the Government's need and that the supporting data which forms the basis for the Limited Sources Justification are accurate and complete:<br />/s/ Technical Contact TSA OIT IAD FO Branch, 092619<br />(redacted)</p>
<p>(xi) For justifications under 8.405-6(a)(1), a written determination by the approving official identifying the circumstance that applies.</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(c)(2)(ix), I certify that the Limited Sources Justification is complete and to the best of my knowledge and belief:<br />/s/ Matthew Ashurst, 092619<br />Matthew Ashurst, Contracting Officer, TSA</p>
