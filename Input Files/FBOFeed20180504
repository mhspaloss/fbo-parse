<CONTACT>Onyenauche Washington, Contracting Officer, Phone (984) 287-3064, Email uche.washington@nih.gov - 
<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.</strong> The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, <strong>intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award a contract to Life Technologies Corporation (5781 Van Allen Way, Carlsbad CA 92008-7321)</strong> for the supply of biological materials (enzymes and reagents). This acquisition is being conducted using the procedures under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.5, "Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items" in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1901. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the quote and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380, "Testing Laboratories" with a size standard of $15M. A Single Award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract type is anticipated. The anticipated program ceiling for the acquisition is $3,000,000.00 for 5 years.
<p><br />The NIEHS is one (1) of 27 research institutes and centers that comprise the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The Division of Intramural Research (DIR) conducts in-house research and training and its scientists are involved in studies that contribute to the understanding of: (1) Biological and chemical processes, (2) Role of environmental agents in human disease and dysfunction, (3) Underlying mechanisms of environmentally-associated diseases, and (4) Intervention and prevention studies to reduce the effects of exposures to environmental agents. This requirement supports the laboratories and branched under the DIR by providing enzymes and reagents to support continued research across the programs that comprise the Division. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The current contract, HHSN273201400004I, with Life Technologies Corporation expires on November 20, 2018</span> and substitution of any of the current products for different products would likely introduce new variables into the experimental results, consequently negating the validity of an entire research project. It is well known that the ability to reproduce data is a scientific standard necessary for publication. In this case, what applies to the current reagents is the control variable, also known as the constant variable. As the name suggests, it is the variable that needs to remain the same. There is currently more than one control or constant variable in this scientific experiment which the scientist intends to observe as much as the dependent variable. If the control variables aren't held constant, the scientist will not know if the independent variable caused the change in the dependent variable or if the change was due to the control variable. As such, it is imperative that everything reproduced in this case, is done in the lab using the EXACT same reagents.</p>
<p><strong>This is NOT a solicitation for quotations, quotation abstracts, or a request for competitive quotations</strong>; however, all responses received within&nbsp;15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responses must cleary and thoroughly defend any claims or assertions that attempt to refute the science above</span>. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within&nbsp;15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a contract will be issued to Life Technologies Corporation. There is no solicitation package available. The Contracting Officer for this requirement is Ms. Onyenauch&eacute; Washington. All questions or concerns relating to this notice shall be submitted by e-mail to uche.washington@nih.gov</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a solicitation to General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS), 38500 Mound Road, Sterling Heights, MI for the procurement of twenty-two (22) MK 46 Gun Weapons Systems (GWS).  Sixteen (16) GWS will be installed on the LCS Platform and six (6) GWS will be installed on the DDG 1000 Platform. (The six for the DDG 1000 Platform were synopsized on December 21, 2012.)

GDLS is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the sole producer of the MK 46 GWS. The determination for a sole source is supported by a technical analysis and assessment that concluded only the GDLS MK 46 GWS can meet the LCS and DDG 1000 technical performance requirements. Therefore, GDLS is the only known firm possessing the requisite technical (production and engineering) expertise to produce a technically compliant GWS to meet specification in a cost-effective manner while supporting the LCS and DDG 1000 shipbuilding program schedules.

The potential contract will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1), only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GDLS directly.

This pre-solicitation notice is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.
 Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by Naval Sea Systems Command.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is NOT a request for proposal or invitation for bid; this is for INFORMATIONAL purposes only to make industry aware of the upcoming requirement.
<p>A response is not required at this time.</p>
<p>The USACE Buffalo District is currently preparing a solicitation to award a contract for a project in Harpersfield Township, Geneva, Ashtabula County, Ohio, United States.  The work is to be performed onto a dam in the vicinity of the Harpersfield covered bridge that crosses the Grand River.</p>
<p>The proposed project consists of demolishing and removing part of the left (south) abutment wall and part of the right (north) abutment wall and replacing them with cast-in-place, formed and battered abutment walls of approximately the same lengths, including drainage appurtenances and backfill behind the new abutments.  The new abutment walls will be higher than the existing walls, sections of the existing walls to remain will be raised to match the new abutment height.  The abutment walls will be textured to visually mimic the existing stacked stone abutment wall (south abutment).  Part of the existing stone retaining wall (south abutment) will be removed and reconstructed to tie in with the new cast-in-place wall. The existing 326-feet wide dam spillway will be completely removed down to the structure's concrete base.  The existing fish ladder will be completely removed and will not be replaced.  A new cast-in-place concrete lamprey barrier structure will be constructed in close proximity to the existing dam location.  All removals and new construction will be accomplished in the dry (River diverted around the work).  A disposal location for excavated materials and removals will be provided.  The new structure will have two vertical drops with steel lips to prevent lamprey migration over the barrier.  The new structure will function as a velocity barrier for both burst and sustained lamprey swim performance.  Within the new abutment walls at each end of the barrier, a concrete box will be constructed to house steel lamprey traps (to be built and installed by others).  Water will be drawn from upstream of the new barrier to provide flow through the traps and attractant flow downstream of the traps.  All work will be performed in the vicinity of the Harpersfield Covered Bridge and steel truss bridge.  This is a historic structure and must not be damaged in any way during construction.</p>
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACT AND NAICS: An IFB (Invitation for Bid) is planned for one (1) Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract. The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) for this effort is 237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District will be issuing an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for a Spot Painting project, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">located at the Sawyer River #3, Sawyer River Road, White Mountain Forest in Livermore, New Hampshire</span></em>. This will be a <strong>Small Business set-aside</strong>. The NAICS code for the work is 238320. The Solicitation is planned to be issued in June 2018, and will be for a firm fixed price contract. The construction period will extend over Summer and Fall 2018. The estimated magnitude of this project is between $100,000 and $250,000.
<p>Contractor should note that work on this project will require fall protection. The Sawyer River Bridge #3 is approximately 15 feet above the underlying stream bed. No traffic control is necessary, as this bridge is not open to the public. This project consists of the following components:</p>
<p>-Construct a suspended work platform underneath the bridge, or construct scaffolding resting on the stream bed to access substructure components. Use of a snooper truck is impracticable.<br />-Use solvents to clean the surfaces to receive paint.<br />-Use a chipping hammer or wire brush to break up and remove failed paint in localized spots only. No scraping of the existing coating system will be permitted due to the presence of lead. The percent of failed paint to be removed and re-painted is estimated to be about 40% of the total surface area of the bridge components. The bridge has a timber driving surface and side rails. Components needing spot painting include the substructure only.<br />-Apply primer and top coats of paint to the places where the paint has failed only.</p>
<p>This is not a request for bids at this time; the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about June 2018. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted.

The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 200,000 cubic yards of sand from Sandy Hook Channel. Dredging would be required to a depth of -35 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2 feet allowable overdepth. The dredged material is expected to consist primarily of sand and gravel. </span></p>

Additionally, multiple ocean going barged, tug boats and ancillary equipment will be needed to perform the dredging, transport and placement activities.

Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS:" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS."</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this sources sought notice is to help the Government obtain information regarding: (1) The availability and capability of qualified sources/ availability of competition; and (2) the business size and socioeconomic status (e.g. small or large business, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small business; woman-owned small business; woman-owned small businesses; small disadvantage businesses; or large business), relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.<br />&nbsp;
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, is one (1) of 27 research institutes and centers that comprise the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The mission of the NIEHS is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. The Branches &amp; Laboratories at NIEHS fall under the Intramural Research and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Divisions. The Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) ensures the judicious and humane use of rodents for biomedical research that benefits human and animal health. The CMB maintains the animal facility for the NIEHS and is responsible for the health and well-being of the research animal population. The health and well-being of these animals are a critical factor in many research projects. Laboratory animals are susceptible to many different diseases, which may be symptomatic or subclinical but still have profound effects on research. Some of these diseases can be zoonotic (contagious to humans). Diagnosis of these animal diseases is very important in maintaining the quality of the NIEHS research animals as well as ensuring the safety of the researcher and animal care staff. The Quality Assurance Laboratory (QAL) within CMB is responsible for monitoring the health status of incoming and resident animal colonies and making appropriate decisions based on the results of this monitoring. The QAL is also responsible for the NIEHS animal health surveillance program. Sentinel animals are used most often monitor the animal population. Monitoring may include a complete necropsy, examination for ecto- and endoparasites, microbial identification, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and analysis of rodent blood or serum for response of the immune system to pathogens (serological assay). QAL is responsible for reporting the health status of the animal or tissue specimens back to the appropriate veterinarian(s) and researchers. The primary scope of the contract will be to perform diagnostic testing services as part of the animal health surveillance program. Identification of unknown bacterial or fungal isolates using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrophotometry or partial genomic sequencing of biological samples may also be requested. Other assays, such as Western Blot or Immunofluorescent Antibody (IFA) may be requested to confirm initial, equivocal, serological results.

<p>3.0 Background</p>
<p>The P-8A aircraft configuration includes multiple components manufactured by Honeywell International, Inc. Historically, Honeywell components and support have been contracted as Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) under contracts with the aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) and Boeing Defense Services (BDS). For improved affordability, the P-8A Program is seeking to establish a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) to contract directly with Honeywell; however, the Government will consider responses for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SUMMARY:
<p>REQUIREMENT: APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>The Department of Labor, Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) requires expert to provide mobile application development and testing and related IT services to support ILAB's mobile and web applications. This RFI announcement is for mobile application development and testing and related IT services.</p>
<p>It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit input from industry regarding the technical approach and market availability of mobile application development and testing and related IT services outlined below. The Government will use this information to determine what sources are available and if there is an adequate number of qualified interested Small businesses with the required capabilities to support the services described herein. No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation; however, respondents deemed wholly qualified will be considered in any resulting solicitation for this requirement.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for the mobile application development and testing and related IT services. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government for forming a binding contract.</p>
<p>This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated experience with services and support necessary to plan and execute ILAB's mobile application development and testing and related IT services contract.</p>
<p>All interested contractors are requested to provide a written response to the questions and potential task areas provided below. All small businesses to include Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, and Women-Owned and service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely response to this Request for Information (RFI). A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist DOL in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services. In additional, this information will also be used to assist DOL in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan and/or small business goal percentages.</p>
<p>Participation in this market research is voluntary and is not, in any way, part of a DOL acquisition, solicitation, negotiation, or any discussions expected to result in a contract. All costs associated with market research, presentations, and demonstrations will be the responsibility of the vendor/system integrators participating in the market research, and not DOL.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) leads the U.S. Department of Labor's efforts to ensure that workers around the world are treated fairly and are able to share in the benefits of the global economy. ILAB's mission is to promote a fair global playing field for workers in the United States and around the world by enforcing trade commitments, strengthening labor standards, and combating international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking. Our efforts help to ensure a fair playing field for American workers and contribute to stronger export markets for goods made in the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) reports on child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking in accordance with Congressional Mandates and an Executive Order.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13126 of 1999 requires ILAB, in consultation with the Departments of State, Homeland Security and Treasury, to publish and maintain a list of products made with forced or indentured child labor ("EO List"). In order to be placed on the list, there must be current (no more than 5 years old) relevant and probative information from a credible source and corroborated by other credible sources, indicating that there is a significant incidence of forced or indentured child labor in the production of that product in the country in question. Further information on the Executive Order can be found at: http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-products/index-country.htm.</p>
<p>Section 412(c) of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (TDA) amended the Trade Act of 1974, which requires the President to submit an annual report to the Congress on the status of internationally recognized worker rights within each country eligible for benefits under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and other trade benefit programs. The TDA additionally requires the annual report to include "the findings of the Secretary of Labor with respect to the beneficiary country's implementation of its international commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor." The Department of Labor's Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor ("TDA Report") provides the Congress with an overview of government efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor (WFCL) in all GSP and other trade benefit program-eligible countries. In order to provide a sufficient basis on which to judge a government's efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, the report also provides information as to the prevalence and nature of the worst forms of child labor in each country. Further information on this report can be found at: http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/.</p>
<p>The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 (TVPRA) directs ILAB to develop and make available to the public the List of Products Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor ("TVPRA Report"). ILAB has developed and published a set of criteria by which goods are identified and placed on this list. In order to be placed on the list, there must be current (no more than 5 years old) relevant and probative information from a credible source and corroborated by other credible sources, indicating that there is a significant incidence of forced labor or child labor in the production of that good in the country in question. Further information on the TVPRA can be found at http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/</p>
<p>In September 2015, ILAB published information from these three reports in its first ever mobile application for iOS titled, "Sweat &amp; Toil: Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking Around the World." ILAB simultaneously released the data from the app through an open source application programming interface (API), managed by USDOL's Office of Public Affairs. In February 2016, ILAB released the Android version of the Sweat &amp; Toil App.</p>
<p>The TVPRA also directs ILAB to "work with persons who are involved in the production of goods on [ILAB's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor] to create a standard set of practices that will reduce the likelihood that such persons will produce goods using [forced and child labor]." ILAB developed Comply Chain: Business Tools for Labor Compliance in Global Supply Chains ("Comply Chain") to fulfill this mandate and to complement to its other efforts to ensure that workers around the world are treated fairly and are able to share in the benefits of the global economy. In 2017, ILAB developed the Toolkit into the mobile application, Comply Chain: Business Tools for Labor Compliance in Global Supply Chains. Comply Chain contains best social compliance practices adapted from the Toolkit in a user-friendly format.</p>

To enable the determination of gene regulation, the EL requires sequencing services to decrease downstream variability and HiSeq sequencing from environmental samples. Large numbers of unique genes must be analyzed in many individuals to accurately determine if organisms have been exposed to and/or have been negatively affected by toxic chemicals and environmental stressors. ERDC-EL along with collaborators is currently assessing toxicity of environmental contaminants in various species and requires these services to quantitatively determine the amount that these genes are expressed or altered under these conditions.</p>
<p>Currently, the EL has only one instrument, the Illumina Mi-Seq that can be used for very short sequencing of samples. Most of the EL research projects now require long sequencing of samples using cutting edge technology and instrumentation for ongoing research projects. A Master BPA is required to obtain these services. Each company should provide all data and results within 30 working days from receipt of the samples.<br />Due to data variability between companies performing sequencing services, each project will use the company that performs the first call for the services for the project from beginning to end. This will eliminate error due to different instrumentation, different sample and data processing and due to different methods. The companies performing these services must use high through put instruments such as Illumina Hi-Seq X instruments, Hi-Seq 4000 instruments, Hi-Seq 2500 instruments, NovaSeq 6000.</p>
<p><br />The following sequencing services are needed for ongoing projects. Because of the unique nature of sequencing, several companies will need to be chosen for the Master BPA because no one company is capable of providing all of the services listed below. Each company should outline exactly what sequencing services that they can provide from the list below.<br />1. Whole Genome Sequencing<br />2. Whole Exome Sequencing<br />3. mRNA-Seq<br />4. IncRNA Seq<br />5. Small RNA Sequencing<br />6. IsoSeq on PacBio<br />7. Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing<br />8. CHIP-Seq<br />9. Single Cell DNA Sequencing<br />10.

<DESC>RFI 36C10X18Q9102

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA)
VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 
VHA REHABILITATION SURVEY SERVICES

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY (as defined in FAR 15.201(e)), this is not a solicitation. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted, or respond to any questions or comments that may be submitted in response to this RFI. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government and does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for a Market Research Only. 

The agency does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI, but rather gather capabilities and market information pertinent for acquisition planning. The responses to this RFI will be captured as market research and may contribute to the development of an acquisition strategy. Information provided may be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. 

This RFI/Source Sought is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. 

PURPOSE: The purpose of this Sources Sought / RFI is twofold:

Conduct market research to obtain information pertaining to industry capability to provide a commercial off the shelf (COTS) OMB approved Rehabilitation survey tool that caters to the Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation and Treatment Services provide by VHA Facilities, and The VA is requesting the capabilities and experience of vendors in providing Office of Management and Budget (OMB)-approved Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) survey(s) and associated services for VA rehabilitation. 

Determine whether small businesses have the capability to provide the needed services (including Veteran-owned, Service-disabled Veteran-owned, and other small business participation, and vehicles and methods to acquire the services).  

BACKGROUND: 
VA is committed to providing specialized treatment and rehabilitation care to Veterans with disabilities. These populations include, but are not limited to, Veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D), blindness or severe visual impairment, traumatic brain injury, amputation, other orthopedic conditions, serious mental illnesses, and homeless Veterans.  As part of our obligation to monitor and assure high quality care to these groups, a valid survey of patient experiences during rehabilitation was launched in 2011.  The rehabilitation survey compliments surveys administered to general VA inpatient and outpatient services that are currently monitored with the Survey of Health Experiences of Patients (SHEP) family of surveys.  

VA rehabilitation programs currently are using the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) developed uSPEQ survey to obtain valid information from their patients on such key areas as:
1) Service responsiveness; 
2) Informed choice; 
3) Respect of individual needs; 
4) Functional outcomes and community participation; 
5) Overall perceived value; 
6) Respondent demographics.

Without continuing such information collection, and the ability to benchmark with leading rehabilitation facilities within and outside the Agency, VA is limited in its ability to do continuous quality improvement; provide informed programmatic development and evaluation; rapidly identify rehabilitation program strengths and weaknesses, or conform to accreditation agency standards.

Use of a rehabilitation survey in VHA s rehabilitation populations is in conformance with the requirements of Executive Order 12862, dated September 11, 1993, and entitled "Setting Customer Service Standards," and Executive Order 13571,  Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service,  issued on April 27, 2011, which call for agencies to post customer service standards and measure results against those standards.

SURVEY/SERVICE REQUIREMENTS:
The survey(s) must be OMB approved (given the lengthy process of gaining approval on a newly developed survey); must be currently deployed and applied in the private/commercial health industry; the vendor must have access to the commercial data and must have the capability to conduct benchmarking and analysis comparison between VHA data and private/commercial sector data where the same survey tool is in use.

The survey must be structured to address service responsiveness; informed choice; respect of individual needs; functional outcomes and community participation; overall perceived value; respondent demographics in each of the following rehabilitation subsets:

Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation and Treatment Services
Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV) Psychosocial Residential 
Rehabilitation Treatment Program (PRRTP) and General Domiciliary (Gen Dom)
Substance Abuse Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (SARRTP) and Dom Substance Abuse Program (Dom SA)
PTSD Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (PTSD RRTP) and Dom PTSD Program
Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (DRRTP)
Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)

 Medical Rehabilitation
Comprehensive Integrated Inpatient Medical Rehabilitation (CIIRP)
Lead Brain Injury Centers (Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers)
Regional Amputation Centers (RAC) and Polytrauma Amputation Network Sites (PANS)
Polytrauma Assistive Technology Labs
Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Program (one per VISN)
Spinal Cord Injury & Disorders (SCI&D) System of Care
Comprehensive Blind Rehabilitation Centers and the Outpatient Low Vision-Blindness Rehabilitation Continuum of Care Clinics

The Government encourages teaming/partnering.<br />Background<br />The US Army has multi-sensor platforms that are able to capture multiple sources of intelligence data for tactical operations using airborne platforms, such as the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), and vehicles, such as Vigilant Pursuit. In addition, exploitation of open-source information (both publically available and derived from exploitation of captured devices) will provide additional intelligence data. Improved fusion and pattern analysis of these data are critical elements in order to decrease the user cognitive load by improving fusion algorithms and system ease of use. Fusion analytics introduces capabilities that will provide enhanced analytics and services as well as accommodate data from all the intelligence domains (e.g., HUMINT, GEOINT, and All Source). This RFI is intended to examine the degree to which the fusion solution will be capable of automating the performance of: normalization for all data, correlation for single or for all intelligence disciplines, relationship detection and aggregation, and pattern discovery/exploitation.<br />Description<br />U.S. Army Communications-Electronic Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is conducting this RFI to determine potential capability and innovative approaches for fusion analytics.<br />Data Construct<br />Imbedded in such fusion capabilities is an underlying data construct, for which the government will provide a notional API for information. A central hub supporting fusion capabilities is an entity-relationship datastore that provides information about entities of relevance to the operational goal of situational understanding. To that end, these entities will be of specific types as required by operational need: military units, facilities, pieces of equipment, individual persons, significant events, organizations, personas, and networks. In addition to providing attributes about the entities themselves, the datastore (and API) also needs to provide for interrelationships between the entities, and support attributes on those relationships as well. This data structure can be viewed as a graph, with the entities seen as nodes and the relationships as edges.<br />The nature of intelligence analysis for situation development leads to maintenance of three "layers" of data: raw inputs (sensor reports, text files, video, etc.), entities and relationships extracted from the raw inputs but not yet de-duplicated/correlated, and a &lsquo;fused' set of entities and relationships that represents a<br />single set of correlated data on each. The attributes maintained in the fused layer will contain data values intelligently combined from the constituent uncorrelated pieces, and specific approaches for this combination can be provided. Provenance ("entity history") is also required between these three layers - raw inputs are connected to their extractions, and the extracted-but-uncorrelated entities and relationships are connected to their fused resultants.<br />Objective<br />Describe new, existing, and/or enhancements of capabilities to achieve the following objectives:<br />Fusion Analytics Capability Areas<br />1. Extraction of entities and relationships (with type and attributes) from unstructured text<br />Given the types of relevant entities described above, extract from unstructured free text any available entities, determine at some level their entity type, extract available attributes about each entity (including identity, time, location), and identify potential relationships between the entities (to include some description of the type of the relationship).<br />2. Correlation of extracted entities and relationships (six cases)<br />Correlation is defined as the decision that two or more uncorrelated entities represent the same real-world item. In general, there are six methods which are used today to make a correlation decision:<br />a. Matching of external systems' database keys<br />b. Matching of specific entity unique identity attributes<br />c. Similarity of non-unique entity attributes<br />d. General similarity of entity type/location/time of observation<br />e. Tracking movement of units or equipment observations across time<br />f. Similarity of entities based on common relationships within the graph<br />Where applicable, parameters and thresholds for the correlation calculations should be user-modifiable. After a correlation decision is made, a combination process is required to create the fused representation of the correlated entities (and relationships), and to maintain a history of the connections from raw to extracted to fused data. Because the extracted, uncorrelated data is maintained intact, the ability to manually undo and redo combinations of them into fused records should be supported.<br />3. Entity graph refinement<br />Assess and refine the fused datastore based on (1) identifying/discovering implied or inferred relationships between the entities, (2) identifying or inferring aggregations or clusters of entities into "larger" entities (like platforms, organizations, higher echelon units, etc.), (3) improving the identity of an entity by detailed analysis (including geo-temporal, multi-source, semantic disambiguation, and other analyses), or (4) identifying significant activities implied by connected events. In all cases, persist the results of any refinement.<br />4. Pattern recognition and validation (composition, disposition, activity)<br />There are three primary entity patterns of interest: composition (what makes up an entity, such as a unit's owned equipment and subordinate units), disposition (how a group of entities are either physically or notionally arrayed/deployed), and activity (what smaller events can or have aggregated into a larger activity). For these types of patterns, recognize patterns in the existing fused data, and support user validation of those patterns as pattern models.<br />5. Pattern detection and analysis<br />For pattern models either provided by earlier analysis or derived from #4 above, provide the capability to match (detect) the pattern models in the existing fused data and alert users to the data matching the model. User configuration to specify the level of matching desired should also be supported.<br />6. Course of Action (COA) development and assessment<br />Courses of Action are patterns of potential activity/movement by forces (with their patterns of composition and disposition) to accomplish their given mission(s). Support generation/development of possible COAs (in term of patterns) and assessment of alternative COAs against the existing fused data.<br />7. General Data Analysis<br />Support general analytics on the datastore, such as (1) generation of graph metrics (centrality(s), density, connectedness, closeness, transitivity, and others) on selected subsets of the entities/relationship graph; (2) change detection over a selected subset of entities and relationships; (3) specialized analyses over aspects of the fused data (such as mobility/tracking, constructs or activity of communications/networks, geographic or cyber activity, semantic/sentiment analysis, battle damage aggregation, etc.).<br />8. Pedigree development and maintenance<br />Pedigree of data (either on a particular attribute, or on a collection of them) is defined in terms of accuracy (how well do we know a particular piece of data?) and credibility (how well do we believe a particular piece of data?). Based upon the accuracy and credibility of the information sources, derive an initial pedigree for extracted entity and relationship data. Based upon the pedigrees of the extracted components, derive the fused attributes and maintain the fused pedigree value for a correlation/combination action.<br />Response<br />We are asking industry to provide a response to this RFI that includes:<br />&bull; Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the effort, which includes a 1-2 month effort (e.g., installation, integration, testing, and demonstration). Please include any applicable license fees to test/demonstrate the solution. The government will provide relevant data for testing/demonstration purposes.<br />&bull; Propose a commercial software licensing approach that minimizes license management costs and leverages GOTS and COTS products availability under DoD enterprise license vehicles.<br />&bull; Articulate how your solution applies to the tactical enterprise at various domains and echelons.<br />&bull; Describe the risk areas from a cost, schedule and technical approach with your rationale.<br />Responses to this RFI are to be unclassified and received no later than 25 May 2018. All interested parties shall respond in as clear manner as possible to each of the areas listed above. Information is preferred in soft-copy form in Microsoft Word and shall not exceed 10 pages.

<DESC><div>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a modification to the Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) Data Transformation Services (GDTS) II contract for additional services under CLIN 2002 (Software Design, Code, Integrate, and Test). The GDTS-II contract, covering the baseline GDTS functionality for data sources, was solicited under full and open competition and awarded in December 2015 to Raytheon Company, 1737 East CityLine Drive, Richardson, TX 75082. The NGA believes Raytheon is the only source reasonably available to satisfy the requirements. Pursuant to FAR 6.3021(a)(2)(iii), the &ldquo;services may be deemed available only from the original source in case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in &ndash; (A) substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s requirements.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The modification is to support the File-Based Upgrade for developing, integrating, and testing software updates to the GDTS software baseline across all three security baselines in one semi-annual release to improve security and sustainability of the system. The performance of work requires technical expertise and experience in System Engineering, Software Development, Security Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A), and Program Management along with experience and a thorough understanding in NGA test processes, interfaces, and formats that include Data Source Description Document, Mapping Systems Interface Control Document (MICD), MICD Addendum 1, Military Standard (MIL-STD) 2500C, Motion Imagery Standard Board (MISB) Standards, National Support Data Extensions for the National Imagery Transmission Format (STDI-0001), Compendium of Controlled Extensions for the National Imagery Transmission Format (STDI-0002), Implementation Practices of the National Imagery Transmission Format Standard (STDI00005), National Imagery Transmission Format Version 2.1 Commercial Dataset Requirements Document (STDI-0006), and National System for Geospatial-Intelligence Product Description Document (NSGPD). The period of performance for this requirement, under the current option year, will be for six months.&nbsp;</div>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT<br />The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (for a Base and Four Option Year Contract) with Experimental Pathology Laboratories, Inc., 45600 Terminal Drive, Sterling, VA 20166-9400, using the procedures in FAR Part 13, and in reference to 41.U.S.C. 253(c)(1), to provide secure room temperature storage of paraffin blocks and wet formalin fixed tissues from marine mammal cases submitted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Program network members, especially during Unusual Mortality Events (UMEs), to further our understanding of health, health trends and diseases of marine mammal populations in the wild and to provide chain-of custody (COC) for law-enforcement investigations. <br />
<p>The NMFS, Office of Protected Resources works throughout the United States and abroad to detect, investigate, and respond to marine animal health and emergency response issues. Specifically, the archiving and storage capabilities of Experimental Pathology Laboratories, Inc. will be used for health and disease investigations of stranded and live captured wild marine mammals including UME investigations.</p>
<p>The Experimental Pathology Laboratories, Inc. is uniquely qualified to assist with the secure room temperature storage of paraffin blocks and wet formalin fixed tissues for marine mammals. They have significant expertise and experience in archiving and storing paraffin blocks and wet formalin fixed tissues including maintaining samples in limited access areas under chain-of-custody (COC) for law-enforcement investigations. They also have the ability to pull samples from storage for additional research on cases as needed.</p>
<p>The Experimental Pathology Laboratories currently house existing paraffin block and wet formalin fixed tissues from marine mammals from recent UME and Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) investigations. Relocation of these samples would be extremely costly and could potentially result in damage/loss and chain-of-custody violations for law-enforcement violations rendering the samples compromised for investigations.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 493120, Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage, with a business size standard of $27.5 Million. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A 100% small business set aside solicitation will be issued under this notice on or about 9 May 2018 and will remain open for 5 calendar days after issuance. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Wendy.Culbreth@noaa.gov no later than the due date for quotes listed on the solicitation when posted.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(b) Inclue the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.

(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<BR><BR>(a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause—

“Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code” means—

  (1)  A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or

“Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number” means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

“Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number” means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.

“Registered in the SAM database” means that—

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 

  (2)  The Contractor’s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 

  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record “Active”. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.<BR><BR>“System for Award Management (SAM)” means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes—

  (1)  Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;

  (2)  Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number—

    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or

    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.


  (2)  The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:

    (i)  Company legal business name.

    (ii)  Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

    (v)  Company telephone number.

    (vi)  Date the company was started.

    (x)  Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d)  Reserved.

(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.<BR><BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—

      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 

      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and

      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 

    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

The specified treatment will be the foliar application of herbicide mixtures from backpack sprayers to target vegetation using a shielded directed spray technique.<br />Contractor Responsibility: The Contractor shall provide everything--including, but not limited to, all equipment, supplies, transportation, labor, and supervision--necessary to complete the project, except for that which the contract clearly states is to be furnished by the Government.<br />Project Location and Description.<br />Location: The project is located on the Amador Ranger District of the Eldorado National Forest. The location of the work sites and other information pertinent to each treatment unit is contained in the Contract Maps and Supplemental Specifications. The Amador Ranger District office is located at 26820 Silver Drive, Pioneer, CA 95666, approximately 18 miles east of Jackson, CA on State Highway 88. All work sites are within approximately 1 hour travel time from the district office.</p>
<p>Accessibility: Work areas are generally accessible by standard pickup. Four-wheel drive vehicles may be beneficial in improving the access points of any given treatment unit. It is the Contractor's responsibility to reach the work site when it is ready for treatment. The Contracting Officer will determine the access routes which may be used.</p>
<p>Description: All treatment units are regeneration stands resulting from the 2004 Power Fire. They range from 4,000' to 7,000' in elevation. Aspect varies, but is predominantly south-facing. Slope varies, and contains significant steep (&gt;35%) areas. The stands have received varying combinations of treatments since the fire, including but not limited to mechanical site preparation, tree planting, hand cutting of woody brush, and precommercial thinning. They have not received previous herbicide treatment. Woody brush is generally large and dense. Woody brush species include but are not limited to deerbrush and whitethorn (Ceanothus spp.), whiteleaf &amp; greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), chokecherry and bitter cherry (Prunus spp.), gooseberry &amp; sierra currant (Ribes spp.), and bearclover (Chamabaetia foliolosa). Some stands have recent precommercial thinning slash. Trees in these stands consist primarily of planted conifers, but will include residual young growth and natural regeneration which may differ in size and species from the planted trees. All conifers, planted and natural, within the treatment units must be protected from herbicide.</p>
<p>Item 1 consists of areas in which the woody brush has been cut by hand within the last 3 years. The target vegetation is generally dominated by quickly regrowing deerbrush, but includes all woody brush species.</p>
<p>Item 2 (OPTIONAL) consists of areas where the woody brush has not been pre-cut. The target vegetation is generally dominated by whitethorn and/or manzanita, but includes all woody brush species.</p>
<p>Treatment prescriptions vary by stand within each item. For descriptions of the differing treatment prescriptions, see Supplemental Specifications, "Herbicide Prescriptions". For stand specific information, see Supplemental Specifications Data Table.</p>
<p>Boundaries of treatment units will be designated by description by the Contracting Officer's personnel on site at the time of treatment. Boundaries will generally be identifiable features on the ground, such as property lines, roads, ridges, drainages, or the residual tree line. Boundaries may also be indicated with blue and white striped flagging.</p>

Inspections and Acceptance<br />FAR 52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998) <br />This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es): www.arnet.gov/far/<br />FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 1) CLAUSES<br />2.246-4 Inspection of Services--Fixed-Price (AUG 1996)<br />3.1 Quality Control Plan - Contractor Quality Control:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide an approved Quality Control Plan describing methods to insure that the material produced comply with the applicable specifications of the specifications. In addition to the requirements in FAR 52.212-4, the Contractor shall maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government. The intended purpose of the Contractor performing self-inspection is quality control of work being performed, thereby allowing the Contractor to identify and correct any quality deficiencies while the work is in progress. Prior to requesting an inspection or payment, the Contractor shall make available to the Government all of their inspection records of the work performed.</p>
<p><br />3.2 Specific Inspection Procedures<br />Government Inspections<br />Government inspections are for the purpose of satisfying the Government that the services are acceptable and do not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for maintaining quality control.<br />The Contracting Officer's Representative or designated inspector will conduct all inspections. The Contractor (or designated representative) is encouraged to be present to observe inspections. Summary results will be made available on request.<br />Compliance Inspections. Visual compliance inspections will be made on a periodic basis. Such inspections are not final and do not constitute acceptance by the Government. <br />Final Inspections. Final (formal) inspections for payment will be made on completed sub-items only. Contractor shall request final inspections in writing and give the Forest Service at least two working days advanced notice. Inspections will be completed within four working days after the notice is received. If the work is not ready for inspection at the time specified by the Contractor, the cost associated with the inspection attempt may be charged to the Contractor.<br />3.7 Disputed Inspection. <br />The Contractor may request re-inspection without rework if the results are unacceptable. Re-inspection must be requested in writing within 48 hours after receiving written notice of the inspection results. Re-inspection will be accomplished within five working days after receipt of the contractor's written request.<br />The same sampling and inspection procedures will be used, but new samples will be taken. The inspection pattern will be shifted so that new samples will not overlap previously inspected samples. Results will be rounded to the nearest whole percent.<br />If re-inspection results are within five percentage points of the first inspection, the original inspection result will be used in determining acceptability and payment. If re-inspection results are greater than five percentage points above or below the first inspection, the re-inspection results will be used.<br />If the re-inspection results are within five percentage points of the first inspection, the Contractor shall pay the actual costs of the re-inspection.<br />3.8 Re-inspection after Rework. Where rework after a failed inspection may improve the inspection results, the Contractor may rework the area and request (in writing) a second inspection. The Government will charge to the Contractor the cost of this additional inspection. Re-inspection will be accomplished within five working days after the notice is received. The results of the second inspection will be final, and no further rework will be permitted. Areas not ready for re-inspection at the time specified by the Contractor will not be re-inspected, and the results of the first inspection will be final.</p>
<p>Methods of Measurement.<br />Acreage was measured on a horizontal plane using a Global Positioning System.<br />Estimated acreage: Actual acreage worked will be measured by the method(s) indicated above.<br />Sampling:<br />Plots. At least one percent of each treatment area will be sampled by a random series of plots distributed over the entire area. Plot size will be: 1/50 acre</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer representative/inspectors will make visual inspections while work is in progress for compliance with the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Contracting Officer may make a systematic inspection using 1/50th acre (16.7 foot radius circle on a horizontal plane) plots to calculate an inspection quality based on application coverage and crop tree damage. Plots will be selected randomly and will not overlap. Sufficient plots will be taken to achieve a 1% sample of the treatment area (i.e. 1 plot for every 2 acres). Results will be recorded on inspection forms.</p>
<p>The quality of application coverage will be determined by observing the indicator dye or colorant on the target vegetation surfaces. To determine this, the inspection plots will be divided into four (4) quadrants on cardinal directions (North, South, East and West). Each quadrant will be examined for coverage. If more than 90% of the target vegetation surfaces within the quadrant have been treated to specifications, it will be considered acceptable. See also Section J, Exhibit A, Application Coverage.</p>
<p>To determine the percent satisfactory coverage, the number of acceptable quadrants will be divided by the total number of quadrants examined, then multiplied by 100 to give a percentage. For example, out of a total of 30 plots examined (120 quadrants), 112 quadrants received acceptable coverage:</p>
<p>112 / 120 x 100 = 93%</p>
<p>Tree damage will be determined by inspecting each crop tree on the inspection plot. Crop trees will have unacceptable levels of damage if the following occurs:</p>
<p>1. Herbicide mixture or physical damage affecting more than 25% of the green crown.<br />2. Evidence of any amount of herbicide or physical damage on the terminal leader.<br />3. Any physical damage to the bole or stem of the tree.</p>
<p>Tree damage will be determined by dividing the number of damaged trees by the total number of trees in all inspection plots. Percent of damaged trees in excess of 5% will be deducted from the inspection quality.</p>
<p>To calculate inspection quality, inspection plots will be grouped by stand, and then stands will be grouped in order of treatment until the total number of plots equals or exceeds 30. An inspection quality percentage will then be calculated for each such group. Results will be rounded to the nearest whole percent.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE INSPECTION QUALITY CALCULATION: Inspection of two stands yields 25 and 15 plots respectively, which are then grouped to exceed 30 plots. In the total of 40 plots, 152 of 160 quadrants are acceptable, and 12 of 200 crop trees are damaged. The overall inspection quality would be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Application coverage = 152 / 160 X 100 = 95%</p>
<p>Crop tree damage = 12 / 200 X 100 = 6% - 5% = 1% deduction</p>
<p>Inspection quality = 95% - 1% = 94%</p>
<p>Inspection results will be available to the contractor upon request.</p>
<p>E.3 Acceptance<br />Work will be deemed acceptable when the government's visual inspections show acceptable performance and sample plot data indicate a work quality of 90% or higher.<br />3.6 Re-inspection after Rework. Where rework after a failed inspection may improve the inspection results, the Contractor may rework the area and request (in writing) a second inspection. The Government will charge to the Contractor the cost of this additional inspection. Re-inspection will be accomplished within five working days after the notice is received. The results of the second inspection will be final, and no further rework will be permitted. Areas not ready for re-inspection at the time specified by the Contractor will not be re-inspected, and the results of the first inspection will be final.</p>
<p>3.9 Final Cleanup</p>
<p>Before final acceptance, all areas occupied by the Contractor in connection with the work shall be cleaned of all contractor's rubbish, excess materials, temporary structures, and equipment, and all parts of the work area shall be left in a neat and presentable condition.</p>
<p>4. Administration<br />4.1 Payments and Deductions. Payment will be made for fully acceptable work at the prices bid in the schedule of items. In the event of extended non-work periods because of adverse weather, the Contracting Officer may authorize progress payments for partially completed sub-items on a case-by- case basis. In accordance with the inspection clause, payment may be made for less than fully acceptable work at a reduced price. Other exceptions are noted below:</p>
<p>Payment will be made in full if inspection results are 90 percent or higher. If inspection results are below 90 percent, a deduction will be made equal to 2 percent for every 1 percent below 90. For example, if inspection results are 87 percent, the bid price would be reduced by 6 percent. No payment will be made if results are less than 80 percent.</p>
<p>4.2 Liquidated damages will be charged as follows:<br />Trees determined to be "damaged" will be charged for at the rate of $ 3.33 per tree. Such charges will be deducted from earnings. The number of trees to be charged for will be calculated as follows: Total number of damaged trees from the inspection record, multiplied by the reciprocal of the plot size, times the number of acres in the pay item, divided by the total number of plots taken, plus trees determined to be damaged under care of trees specifications.<br />RETAINAGE (applicable to service contracts where work accomplishments are measured in units other than time) The following supplements Clause 52.232-1, Payments:<br />The Contracting Officer may retain up to 10 percent of the invoiced amount if the contractor is behind schedule at the time the invoice is presented. "Behind schedule" means that the percentage of work completed is less than the percentage of time used.</p>
<p>4.3 Government-Furnished Property <br />The Government will provide the following item(s) of Government property to the Contractor for use in the performance of this contract. This property shall be used and maintained by the Contractor in accordance with the provisions of the "Government Property" FAR clause contained elsewhere in the contract.<br />Clean backpack sprayers for wash down of accidently sprayed conifer seedlings.</p>
<p>4.4 Contract Release. <br />Before final payment will be made the Contractor shall sign a release of all claims against the Government arising by virtue of this contract, other than claims, in stated amounts, that the Contractor has specifically excepted from the operation of the release. A release may also be required of the assignee if the Contractor's claim to amounts payable under this contract has been assigned under the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940 (31 U.S.C. 3727 and 41 U.S.C. 15).</p>
<p>4.5 Invoices. <br />Payment will be made from Contractor's invoice. After February 28, 2014 all payment requests must be submitted electronically through the US Department of the Treasure's Internet Payment Platform System (IPP).

The Government assumes no liability for injury occurring to Contractor personnel or to third parties, or for loss, damage, or destruction involving third parties' property as a result of the Contractor's operation. Except that the Government is liable for such loss, damage, or destruction resulting from the negligent or wrongful act(s) of Government employee(s) acting within the scope of their employment.</p>
<p>5. Evaluation.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items. (OCT 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />technical capability<br />past performance<br />Price<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, approximately equal to cost or price. <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the unique entity identifier is maintained with the entity designated at www.sam.gov. for establishment of the unique entity identifier throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the unique entity identifier to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the unique entity identifier does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. <br />(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.204-7004	Alternate A, System for Award Management (Feb 2014)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a)	Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1)	A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2)	A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1)	The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2)	The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011	Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a)  Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b)  If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.	SUPPLIES/SERVICE	QUANTITY	UNIT	UNIT PRICE	AMOUNT<br />0001	Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse	20	EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.	SUPPLIES/SERVICE	QUANTITY	UNIT	UNIT PRICE	AMOUNT<br />0001	Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse	20	EA	 	 <br />0002	Monitor	20	EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048		Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>

<p>(1)  "Defense items," defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part 120.</p>
<p>(2)  "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b)  The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c)  The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d)  Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1)  The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2)  The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>(e)  The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010	Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a)	26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b)	When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1)	The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2)	A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p>(1)	A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>

<p>(d)	Any DoD determination under this clause is not subject to appeal under the Contract Disputes Act.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.  Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.  Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.   Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).  The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.  The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.  The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.  The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.  This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications.  Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico.  Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.  Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility.  Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.  RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.  Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 13 and the format in FAR Subpart 12.603, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being requested, and a full-written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) as a result of this solicitation. A BPA is not a binding contract, but an agreement; thus prices must be set prior to orders being placed against the BPA. Additionally, either party has the right to terminate or re-negotiate an agreement provided a 30-day notification is given. Finally, the establishment of a BPA does not commit the government to making an award. BPA periods of performance are usually for five years or sooner if either party terminates the agreement or the master BPA dollar limit is met. The Government is issuing W912TF-18-T-5001 as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-97 effective 06 Nov 2017. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement 721110, $32.5 million small business size standard.<br />The USPFO for NH Joint Contracting Office, 302 Newmarket St, Newington, NH 03801 seeks area hotels capable of providing up to 50 rooms for double occupancy and 15 rooms for single occupancy. The Government intends to enter into a BPA for five years (1 June 2018 to 30 May 2023) and the agreement shall be reviewed annually. The performance work statement (PWS), attachment 1, provides a full listing of the qualifications potential offerors should meet in order to be considered for award.<br />Offerors should also review the description of agreement in attachment 2 prior to submitting quotes. If interested in establishing a BPA with the New Hampshire Air National Guard, offerors shall submit the attached quotation sheet (attachment 3) no later than the closing date of this solicitation. In doing so, vendors shall also specify the quantity of rooms available for unit training assembly (UTA) weekends and weekdays as availability may fluctuate monthly.

Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their<br />own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to<br />assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill,<br />injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for<br />reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family<br />to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or<br />stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections<br />under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.41 per hour or $176.40 per week or $764.40 per month</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.13 per hour, or $165.20 per week, or $715.87 per<br />month*</p>
<p>*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA-<br />covered contract also covered by EO 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal<br />Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any<br />paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor, 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (See 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin<br />Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,<br />Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and<br />Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another<br />day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)<br />(See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor<br />prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final<br />determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which<br />shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day<br />of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure<br />to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested<br />parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the<br />date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act<br />and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are<br />included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy<br />of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See<br />29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties<br />requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage<br />determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).</p>

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<p>EVALUATION PROCEDURE/BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>1. This acquisition will utilize the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedure to make a best value award. A decision on the technically acceptability of each offeror's proposal will be made. For those offerors which are determined to be technically acceptable, award will be made to the offeror who submitted the lowest overall price. While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the technical go/no go process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgement is implicit throughout the evaluation process. The Government intends to make an award based on initial proposals received. If further questions are required, the contracting officer may contact the offeror or offerors. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements. By submission of its offer, the offeror accepts all Solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offerors shall be treated equally except for their prices.</p>

<p>c. Offeror must have one year minimum experience in broadcasting Television (TV) programs.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer
conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
1. Past Performance- To demonstrate acceptable past performance, the Offeror shall provide
documentation of satisfactory performance on past or current contracts of a similar type, size, scope, and
complexity, performed within the last three (3) years including references, with names and contact
information of the references who can verify such past performance. Past performance information of key
personnel may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance. In the case of an Offeror
without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not
available, the Offeror will be evaluated as neutral on Past Performance, providing the Offeror supplies a
certified statement with their offer that no past performance information is available. Neutral past
performance is not negatively scored but may have a negative impact in the overall consideration for
award. The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references
provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other
sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The Offeror is cautioned that while
the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past
performance rests with the Offeror. Limit past performance documentation to four pages.<BR><BR>2. Technical Capability- Technical Capability is defined as the ability to perform all performance
requirements as listed in the attached PWS, while maintaining quality and timeliness. To demonstrate
acceptable technical capability, the Offeror shall provide documentation demonstrating this ability in the
form of a brief plan of how they will meet the requirements of the PWS.
3. Price- All proposals submitted will be evaluated for Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.
The Government will issue an award to the Offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the
Government but not necessarily the lowest price. If all things are equal, the Offeror which is most
advantageous to the Government may also be the lowest price determined to be reasonable IAW FAR
12.209. Offerors are encouraged to propose their best price. The Government will evaluate offers for
award purposed by adding the total price all Line Items. The resulting contract from this solicitation will be
a firm-fixed price contract.
(b) Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to Price.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful
offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without
further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an
offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.
(d) It is not the intent of the Government to enter into negotiations. It is incumbent upon the Offeror to
submit sufficient information for the Government to determine satisfactory Past Performance, Technical
Capability, and Price reasonableness. Failure to submit sufficient information for the Government to
determine Technical Capability, Past Performance, or Price may result in the rejection of your proposal.

An award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price (IAW FAR 52.2122-2(b)), of proposals
meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.<BR><BR>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>This solicitation is being issued as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>Solicitation W912LQ-18-Q-0022 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-97, effective 06 Nov 2017. This procurement is being issued unrestricted under NAICS code 312113.</p>
<p>The Virginia Army National Guard (VAARNG) requires ice and reefer trucks for multiple events during the period&nbsp;June 1 - August 31, 2018.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the vendor whose quote is the lowest price, including an evaluation factor for multiple awards, and is an approved ice vendor in the Commonwealth of Virginia according to the Worldwide Directory of Sanitarily Approved Food Establishments for Armed Forces Procurement. Multiple awards will be considered. An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be used to determine if it is in the government's best interest to make more than one award. Line items will be grouped as identified below for purposes of evaluating multiple awards. As multiple awards may be made, vendors are not required to quote on all groups. However, all requirements per group must be priced or marked as NSP (not separately priced) in order to be considered.&nbsp; NOTE: Should no vendor, otherwise eligible for award,&nbsp;be able to provide all items within a group, the government may make an award(s) from this notice without further advertisement.</p>
<p>This solicitation requires an active registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to the RFQ closing date and time.. Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov. NOTE: Recent changes to SAM require entities to provide a notarized letter before a new registration will be activated; therefore, interested vendors should not delay registering in this mandatory system.</p>
<p>The performance work statement (PWS) included as an attachment to this announcement, or subsequent amendment, will be made a part of any resulting award.</p>
<p>All questions shall be submitted in writing and received prior to 4:00 p.m. ET, May 11, 2018. Questions are to be sent via email to nathan.m.whitaker.mil@mail.mil.</p>
<p>Quotes are due not later than the time and date specified on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov. Email quotes to nathan.m.whitaker.mil@mail.mil. Quotes submitted other than via email will not be considered.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, the KM Coordinator position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working in a dynamic organization dedicated to individual and institutional learning. OTI's success now and in the future depends in large part on its ability to achieve an overarching organizational goal: the effective transfer and ongoing analysis of knowledge and experience - comprised of values, management processes, lessons learned, best practices, standards, and innovations - in real time, with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include: OTI staff in the field and headquarters; OTI's implementing partners around the world; USAID Missions overseas; other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington; other U.S. Government agencies and branches; other donors; other transition, stabilization and reconstruction practitioners; host government and/or other local counterparts; and the U.S. public. All of the above increases OTI's level of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>To this end, the OTI ABC Team supports a model of organizational learning across the office that ensures:<br /> <br />1.     Increased transparency and accountability between the headquarters and field teams;<br />2.     Increased opportunities for peer-to-peer dialogue;<br />3.     Easier access to content and learning resources for a variety of stakeholders;<br />4.     More guidance available in online format; and<br />5.  Provision of tools to surface and apply OTI's programming lessons to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of OTI programs.<br /> <br />The KM Coordinator supports OTI's mission to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs by supporting the capture, curation, and dissemination of research and program learning through product development and by maintaining knowledge management platforms for OTI and implementing partner staff. ABC supports learning and innovation through the application of technology - including OTI's knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools - to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance. ABC will ensure the effective integration of lessons and knowledge into OTI's learning and training resources. ABC coordinates closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Hanford Mission Essential Services Contract (HMESC) Procurement

May 4, 2018
The DOE EM has reviewed the industry feedback received for the alternate cost proposal/analysis method consideration under the RFP, Solicitation No. 89303318REM000007, for the HMESC procurement, and has determined to proceed with the alternate cost proposal/analysis method for the Final HMESC RFP, still anticipated to be released in the spring of 2018.  DOE has also determined to proceed with the alternate cost proposal/analysis method model for the upcoming Central Plateau Cleanup Contract (CPCC) procurement. Please see the attached letter.


March 1, 2018:
The Contracting Officer's Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) Final Analysis for the Hanford Mission Essential Services Contract is hereby posted. 


December 12, 2017:
The DOE EM is continuing to explore alternative approaches to determine whether potential efficiencies exist for Offerors in preparation of proposals for the Hanford Mission Essential Services Contract (HMESC) procurement and/or future procurements, while also ensuring that DOE receives sufficient cost information to perform the required evaluation. Therefore DOE is providing Offerors with an alternate cost model for consideration and feedback.  DOE requests that industry provide objective input (favorable comments, recommended changes, and non-favorable comments) on both cost models (cost model in Draft RFP and Alternate Cost Model) by January 19, 2018.  DOE will analyze industry input, and take this into consideration for the final RFP.

Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.<br />(b) Accordingly, any offeror responding to this solicitation must comply with established HHS EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. The complete text of the Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards.<br />(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are stated in the clause at 352.239-74, Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility.<br />In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT supplies meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must submit an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining whether proposed EIT supplies conform to applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows offerors or developers to self-evaluate their supplies and document-in detail-whether they conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard, and any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template are available under Section 508 policy on the HHS Web site http://www.hhs.gov/web/508.<br />In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must provide enough information to assist the Government in determining that the EIT services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards, including any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues.<br />(d) Respondents to this solicitation must identify any exception to Section 508 requirements. If a offeror claims its supplies or services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and it is later determined by the Government, i.e., after award of a contract or order, that supplies or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.<br />(End of provision)<br />Element 12. IAW HHSAR 352.239-73(b) ELECTRONIC INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY NOTICE (DEC 2015), offeror shall submit its methodology to meet Section 508 requirement. Offers shall not be considered acceptable without addressing and meeting this requirement. <br />C.1.1 Accessibility by Individuals with Disabilities<br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C 794d), as amended by P.L. 105-220 under Title IV (Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1988) and the Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Technology (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36CFR part 1194s) require that all EIT acquired must ensure that:<br />&bull; Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and <br />&bull; Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from an agency have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.
<p>This requirement includes the development, procurement, maintenance, and/or use of EIT products/services. Therefore, any proposal submitted in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT Accessibility Standards. Further information about Section 508 is available via the Internet at http://www.section508.gov.</p>
<p>A. Indian Health Service (IHS) Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Privacy and Security Requirements</p>

Security Assessment and Authorization (SA&amp;A) Process<br />1) The Contractor (and/or any subcontractor) must comply with IHS/HHS and FedRAMP requirements as mandated by federal laws, regulations, and IHS/HHS policies, including making available any documentation, physical access, and logical access needed to support the SA&amp;A requirement. The level of effort for the SA&amp;A is based on the system's FIPS 199 security categorization and IHS/HHS security policies. The Contractor must obtain a FedRAMP certification within 30 days of the contract-award date.</p>
<p>a. In addition to FedRAMP certification, the contractor must develop and complete an agency SA&amp;A package to obtain an agency ATO prior to system deployment/service implementation. The agency ATO must be approved by the IHS Authorizing Official (AO) prior to implementation of system and/or service being acquired.</p>
<p>b. CSP systems must leverage a FedRAMP accredited third-party assessment organization (3PAO).</p>
<p>c. For all acquired cloud services, the SA&amp;A package must contain the following documentation (IHS SA&amp;A deliverables): System Security Plan (SSP), Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M), Security Test and Evaluation (ST&amp;E), and Security Assessment Report (SAR). Following the initial ATO, the Contractor must review and maintain the ATO in accordance with IHS/HHS policies. The Contractor must use IHS-provided templates.</p>
<p>2) IHS reserves the right to perform penetration testing on all systems operated on behalf of the agency. If IHS exercises this right, the Contractor (and/or any subcontractor) must allow IHS employees (and/or designated third parties) to conduct Security Assessment activities to include control reviews in accordance with IHS requirements. Review activities include, but are not limited to, scanning operating systems, web applications, wireless scanning; network device scanning to include routers, switches, and firewall, and IDS/IPS; databases and other applicable systems, including general support structure, that support the processing, transportation, storage, or security of Government information for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>3) The Contractor must identify any gaps between required FedRAMP Security Control Baseline/Continuous Monitoring controls and the contractor's implementation status as documented in the Security Assessment Report and related Continuous Monitoring artifacts. In addition, all gaps must be documented and tracked by the contractor for mitigation in a POA&amp;M document. Depending on the severity of the risks, IHS may require remediation at the contractor's expense before issuing an ATO.</p>
<p>4) The Contractor (and/or any subcontractor) must mitigate security risks for which they are responsible, including those identified during SA&amp;A, and continuous monitoring activities. All vulnerabilities and other risk findings must be remediated by the prescribed timelines from discovery: (1) critical vulnerabilities no later than thirty (30) days and (2) high, medium and low vulnerabilities no later than sixty (60) days. In the event a vulnerability or other risk finding cannot be mitigated within the prescribed timelines above, they must be added to the designated POA&amp;M and mitigated within IHS-designated timelines. IHS will determine the risk rating of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>5) Revocation of a Cloud Service. IHS has the right to take action in response to the CSP's lack of compliance and/or increased level of risk. In the event the CSP fails to meet IHS and FedRAMP security and privacy requirements and/or there is an incident involving sensitive information, may suspend or revoke an existing agency ATO (either in part or in whole) and/or cease operations. If an ATO is suspended or revoked in accordance with this provision, the CO and/or COR may direct the CSP to take additional security measures to secure sensitive information. These measures may include restricting access to sensitive information on the Contractor information system under this contract. Restricting access may include disconnecting the system processing, storing, or transmitting the sensitive information from the Internet or other networks or applying additional security controls.</p>
<p>D. Reporting and Continuous Monitoring<br />Following the initial IHS ATO, the Contractor (and/or any subcontractor) must perform the minimum ongoing continuous monitoring activities specified below, submit required deliverables by the specified due dates, and meet with the system/service owner and other relevant stakeholders to discuss the ongoing continuous monitoring activities, findings, and other relevant matters. The CSP will work with the agency to schedule ongoing continuous monitoring activities. Continuous Monitoring activities should be in alignment with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-137 and the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide.<br />1) At a minimum, the Contractor must provide the following artifacts/deliverables on a monthly<br />basis:<br />a. Operating system, database, web application, and network vulnerability scan results;</p>
<p>b. Updated POA&amp;Ms;</p>
<p>c. Any updated authorization package documentation as required by the annual attestation/assessment/review or as requested by the IHS System Owner or AO; and</p>
<p>d. Prior to any configuration changes to the system and/or system components or CSP's cloud environment that may impact IHS's security posture. Changes to the configuration of the system, its components, or environment that may impact the security posture of the system under this contract must be IHS approved.</p>
<p>E. Configuration Baseline<br />1) The contractor must certify that applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) configuration baseline. The standard installation, operation, maintenance, updates, and/or patching of software must not alter the configuration settings from the approved IHS configuration baseline.</p>
<p>2) The contractor must use Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)-validated tools with configuration baseline scanner capability to certify their products operate correctly with IHS-defined configurations and do not alter these settings.</p>
<p>F. Incident Reporting</p>
<p>The Contractor (and/or any subcontractor) must respond to all alerts/Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) provided by HHS Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRC)/IHS CSIRT teams within 24 hours, whether the response is positive or negative.</p>
<p>FISMA defines an incident as "an occurrence that (1) actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information or an information system; or (2) constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. The HHS Policy for IT Security and Privacy Incident Reporting and Response further defines incidents as events involving cybersecurity and privacy threats, such as viruses, malicious user activity, loss of, unauthorized disclosure or destruction of data, and so on.</p>
<p>A privacy breach is a type of incident and is defined by Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) as the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence where (1) a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information or (2) an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information for an other than authorized purpose. The HHS Policy for IT Security and Privacy Incident Reporting and Response further defines a breach as "a suspected or confirmed incident involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII)."<br />In the event of a suspected or confirmed incident or breach, the Contractor (and/or any subcontractor) must:<br />1) Protect all sensitive information, including any PII created, stored, or transmitted in the performance of this contract so as to avoid a secondary sensitive information incident with FIPS 140-2 validated encryption.</p>
<p>2) NOT notify affected individuals unless so instructed by the CO or designated representative. If so instructed by the CO or representative, the Contractor must send IHS approved notifications to affected individuals in accordance with IHS-specific timelines, processes, and formats.</p>
<p>3) Report all suspected and confirmed information security and privacy incidents and breaches to the IHS Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT), COR, Contracting Officer (CO), IHS Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) (or his or her designee), and other stakeholders, including incidents involving PII/Protected Health Information (PHI), in any medium or form, including paper, oral, or electronic, as soon as possible and without unreasonable delay, no later than one (1) hour, and consistent with the applicable IHS and HHS policy and procedures, NIST standards and guidelines, as well as US-CERT notification guidelines. The types of information required in an incident report must include at a minimum: company and point of contact information, contract information, impact classifications/threat vector, and the type of information compromised.

<p>I.	The solicitation will include work on buildings and land located on the 200-acre Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) campus. Scientists and staff at the facilities slated for Deactivation and Demolition (D&amp;D) historically performed radiochemistry research, as well as most of the buildings have previously hosted radioactive isotopes, beryllium, or hazardous chemicals. Reconnaissance level characterization has shown that there are distributed radiological and chemical contaminants in the building structures, drains, concrete, and footprint area soil. Historically, buildings have enough asbestos in siding, roof and floor tiles and lead paint to require special handling. Facilities may also partially overlay a groundwater plume with Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) contamination that is subject to regulation by State of California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and local environmental agencies. With this work, LBNL will prepare the site for future industrial use redevelopment.</p>
<p>The contract vehicle contemplated is a Master Agreement. This establishes the terms, conditions, and pricing between the parties under which Task Orders (collectively hereinafter "Orders"). The Awardee may be asked to provide the Goods and Services to the University through Task Orders (Orders).  Each Order will include a detailed scope of work, the pricing structure for the work, the schedule for completion of the work, and any special conditions that might apply to the specific Order, such as liquidated damages and bond requirements.  The University will be responsible for inspection and acceptance of the work under each Order.</p>
<p>The Awardee will be responsible for providing construction management and general contractor services, as required on each Order, to perform Services and provide Goods. Orders may include but are not limited to:</p>

This capability will benefit the Library and the library community by providing cost effective document delivery for those libraries who are our partners in Interlibrary Lending. System functionality is maintained by periodic and on-demand maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair of designated proprietary and COTS systems, of which Konica-Minolta PS7000 is an example.</p>
