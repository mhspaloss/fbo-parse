In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>FAR 52.203-18 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS OR STATEMENTS-REPRESENTATION (JAN 2017)</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

A.4.1 MOWING, TRIMMING & EDGING

 (a) SCOPE: 

The Contractor shall be responsible for mowing, edging, and trimming all grass within the Cypress Hills National Cemetery and the Union & Mount of Victory plots located within the private Cypress Hills Cemetery. Both sites encompass approximately 18.0 acres of lawn area. 

(b) NCA STANDARDS: 

(i) Standard 2.1c: 95% of turf in visually prominent areas is maintained within one inch above the range of that which is professionally recommended for that type of turf and region. 

(ii) Standard 2.6: Turf surrounding a headstone or marker is trimmed to its recommended height. 

(c) PROCEDURES: 

(i) Equipment: The Contractor shall use rear-discharge mowers only. Riding mowers may be used if they are not operated within two (2) inches of headstones, markers, monuments, tree trunks or other vertical surfaces. Commercial grade power trimmers and power edger will be used to trim grass from around headstones, monuments, markers, etc. 

(ii) Cutting blades on mowing and trimming equipment must be kept sharp so that grass tips are cleanly cut and not torn or damaged. The height of grass is what is measured to get the correct cutting height. The cutting height of all mowing equipment shall be set to maintain a turf height of three inches (3.0"   3.5 ). At no time will more than one and a half inches (1.5") of new growth be removed during any single mowing. 

(iii) Mowing: The Contractor shall mow all turf areas beginning on April 15th or when turf has come out of winter dormancy and is actively growing. Mowing shall be accomplished on a weekly cycle (or as otherwise directed by the COR). If grass clippings are evident, the Contractor shall remove and dispose of the clippings at no extra cost to the Government. Mowing shall conclude on November 30th. 

(iv) Trimming: In conjunction with mowing, trimming of un-mowed grass areas will commence on April 15th or the first workday thereafter. The base of headstones, trees, monuments, markers, buildings walls, fences, signs and other vertical surfaces shall be trimmed weekly (or as otherwise directed by the COR). The trimming shall conclude on November 30th. 

Note: All un-mowed grass around headstones, monuments, markers, and other vertical surfaces shall be trimmed to keep the grass at the prescribed three-inch (3.0") height standard. Special care will be taken not to scalp between or around headstones and other vertical surfaces. 

(v) Edging: From April thru November, all streets, curbs, walkways, tree wells, shrub and flower beds shall be edged at a minimum of once monthly (or as otherwise directed by the COR). Edging shall provide a clear zone 1/2  wide by 1  deep with all vegetation removed from joints and cracks. Damage to asphalt / concrete shall be avoided. 

(vi) Memorial Day & Veterans Day Ceremonies: Unless otherwise requested by the COR, edging of cemetery grounds shall be performed within one (1) week prior to the Memorial Day weekend, and one (1) day prior to Veterans Day (November 11th). 

(vii) Any clippings deposited on roadways or other non-turf grass areas will be removed the same day as the mowing event that produced them. Any clippings deposited on sidewalks or at public visitor areas including at the Committal Shelter areas will be removed at same time mowing work is occurring. 

(viii) Contractor shall be familiar with and utilize different mowing patterns. Changing direction and patterns reduces turf wear providing a cleaner cut. Contractor shall clean all mowing and trimming equipment before unloading at the cemetery. This will minimize the possibilities of weed contaminates to cemetery turf from outside mowing areas. The contractor shall take the utmost care not to damage headstones, markers, floral or commemorative items, structures, survey monuments, irrigation equipment, etc. while performing mowing services. 

(ix) The Contractor will remove and replace all floral or commemorative items, etc. to their proper place while performing mowing services. The Contractor shall repair or replace all damaged items caused by the contractor at no additional cost to the cemetery as directed by the COR. 

(x) New seed/sod may be present at any newly buried gravesites, second interment gravesites, and repaired gravesite locations. New sod or seed will be hand mowed until it is fully established to the point where it will not be damaged by riding mowers. All mowing around trees will be accomplished in a manner that prevents a  ringing pattern  around the tree and associated damage to turf. Contractor shall vary wheel-width patterns and mowing patterns after each mowing to prevent and avoid wheel rutting from occurring. 

(xi) Turf in burial and public areas should be maintained at a height within one-inch range of that which is professionally recommended for the recommended grass type for that geographic region. Optimally, the height should be no more than half an inch above that range. For example, the height of Kentucky Blue / Perennial Rye grass should be between 3.0  and 3.5 . Grass is trimmed on borders. 

(xii) Edging: Edge all curbs, walkways, roadways permanent building / structure lines, tree wells and shrub beds within the cemetery area. COR will conduct random inspections of edging weekly.

All walkways, roads, and parking areas will be swept prior to interment services or on a weekly basis. 

Storm Clean-Up (wind, rain, hail, snow, ice, etc.): Cemetery should be checked and cleaned up next working day following the storm unless the extent of the storm prompts civil defense authorities to declare emergency movement only. Should this occur, clean-up should be done as soon as emergency restrictions are lifted. 

A.4.3 HEADSTONE CLEANING 

(a) SCOPE: Work consists of making sure that headstones are clean and free of any objectionable debris or staining. 

(b) NCA STANDARDS: 

(i) Headstones, markers & niche covers are clean, free of debris and objectionable accumulations. 

(c) PROCEDURES: 

(i) All temporary markers, floral, commemorative or other types of decorations (arrangements) causing interference with the cleaning of upright headstones /markers will be carefully and orderly moved from and upon completion of the cleaning of the headstones / markers, moved back to the gravesite by the Contractor. 

(ii) Cleaning Techniques will demonstrate a clear understanding of, and the sensitivity to, such environmental issues as ground water contamination, wetlands, etcetera and will be consistent and fully compliant with all applicable Federal, State and County laws, ordinances and regulations. General requirements for application of the cleaning product: 

1. As of June 2012, D/2 Biological Solution is the only authorized cleaner of marble headstones and markers at national cemeteries. General background on the use of this product can be found at the following website, but information in that report shall not be submitted for requirements in the contract: http://ncptt.nps.gov/wp-content/uploads/Best-Practices-Final.pdf. 

2. Clean water will be used to wet the stone prior to washing, to apply the cleaning product and to rinse the stone after washing. Once the stone is wet, cleaning techniques with water will include low pressure water spraying with the wand affixed with a fan tip. The distance between the fan tip and the headstone surface shall be a minimum of 12 .

3. When water under pressure is used, such pressure will not be greater than 500 psi and work will be accomplished in a manner that does not cause any etching of the stone surface to occur. A test cleaning will be done in an inconspicuous area of a headstone (based on age and or style) and approved by the COR prior to cleaning all like headstones and markers. The older the headstone or marker the more likely that power washing can cause damage, lower psi (up to 200 psi) is recommended. 

4. Hand scrubbing may be used as needed. If manual agitation is necessary to remove soiling, only a soft bristle (synthetic or natural) brush shall be used; metal or stiff plastic shall not be used because it can scratch the stone. 

5. Rinsing: Thoroughly rinse the headstone or marker surface using clean, clear water under low pressure or without pressure. 

6. Site disturbance: If water used in cleaning should soften the soil around the base of the headstone or marker so it is loosened, care will be taken not to tip the headstone out of plumb or alignment. 

7. Care will be taken to protect the turf area from damage. Any turf damaged by the Contractor will be restored at Contractor s expense. Upright headstones will be set and anchored firmly in place with no movement from forces subjected by the COR or inspector after cleaning has been completed. 

(iii) APPLICATION OF D/2 BIOLOGICAL SOLUTION 

1. After wetting the headstone or marker in accordance with paragraph (ii) above, apply a heavy spray application of  undiluted D2 Biological Solution  cleaner to all sides of the headstone. Do not dilute the cleaner with water. 

2. Allow D/2 to soak into the stone for 20-30 minutes. Then rinse the product from all headstone or marker surface using clean, clear water under low pressure or without pressure. 

A.4.4 FALL LEAF CLEANUP 

(a) SCOPE: Work consists of making sure that all leaves from deciduous trees that accumulate throughout the cemetery through the fall season are picked up and removed to provide a neat and clean cemetery appearance. 


(b) PROCEDURES: 

Due to the high number of deciduous shade trees on the cemetery property, there are a great number of leaves and leaf debris that need to be cleaned up and removed from the cemetery during the fall and winter. 

Beginning weekly October 15th through December 30th, the Contractor will remove all leaves from the cemetery. Leaves will be hand raked, vacuumed, or blown by backpack style blower or a walk-behind push type machine from all turf areas and along cemetery fence lines onto the roadways and then collected and properly disposed of from the cemetery grounds and the immediate area outside the cemetery. Also, any accumulation of mulched leaves on the turf shall be removed from the cemetery. Windrows and piles of leaves in the developed land that have been accumulated due to the Contractors leaf removal operation - particularly on turf or along roads, plazas and walks shall be removed within three (3) hours of their formation. The Contractor shall remove all leaves that have fallen on turf, roads, walks, shrub beds, plazas and the areas behind the lodge along the cemetery wall - and in the gutters of all buildings and the areas between the buildings. Equipment and vehicles weighing over 6,000 lbs. (2721.55 kg) will not be permitted on the turf for leaf removal - unless done so at the discretion of the COR. 

As leaves on certain cemetery trees (particularly Oaks) may not begin to be dropped or fall until during the winter months after December 30th, the Contractor will schedule a final weekly leaf removal beginning March 15th to remove all remaining leaves before the beginning of the upcoming mowing season. 

A.4.5 TREE REMOVAL / STUMP GRINDING / DEADWOOD TREE PRUNING 

Removal and pruning of all trees shall be accomplished under the direction and guidance of an ISA Certified Arborist provided by the Contractor. All trees shall be topped prior to falling and all limbs over 3 ½  in diameter must be lowered to the ground by ropes. At no time should any branches, tree limbs or sections of the trunk be dropped to the ground or on any headstones. The Contractor will be responsible for any damage to the turf, roads or headstones caused by dropping parts of the tree directly to the ground. 

Deadwood pruning will consist of the removal of all deadwood and broken branches that poses a potential risk which could result in personal injury or property damage. All broken, hanging, dead or otherwise potentially dangerous limbs will be removed to improve the structural integrity of the tree. 

All stumps shall be ground to a minimum of 4" below soil level, or to the lateral roots or to a 6  depth, if possible. The Contractor shall never grind the stumps to the depth that would interfere with the roots of any adjacent tree(s) that the Government intends to retain. All grindings will then be removed from the cavity of the stump. Stump cavities will be filled with clean topsoil, firmly compacted and evenly graded. After grading has been completed the top soiled area will have grass seed (70% turf type tall fescue & 30% Kentucky blue grass) evenly applied and graded. 

All wood chip particles and debris from the tree removal shall be cleaned up thoroughly and removed from the cemetery. The Contractor shall take every precaution to prevent any falling branches or trees from damaging any headstones, roadways, adjacent plant material or structures. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for repair and or replacement to any damaged turf, headstones or other property. 

To insure protection of headstones that are in close proximity to trees being pruned or removed, the Contractor will use covers to place over the headstones while the work is being performed. These covers will be provided by the Contractor. 

Utility Lines Compliance: Where pruning / stump grinding / tree removal conflicts with existing utility service lines (above or below ground), cemetery personnel and the appropriate utility company shall be notified by the Contractor. The Contractor shall obtain all necessary permits and cooperate with the utility company to avoid any damage or liability. 

Debris & Waste Removal: Removal of debris and waste away from the cemetery grounds shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. At the end of each day, the Contractor will remove all pruning / trimming cuts, tree limbs, dead branches, bush / shrub / hedge clippings and other debris from the cemetery site resulting from the work. The Contractor shall ensure at all times that debris and waste generated by the Contractor is kept clear of vehicular and pedestrian traffic throughout the site. NOTE: The Government shall not provide receptacle(s) for disposal of debris related to this contract. 

Communication & Coordination of Work with COTR: Contractor shall participate in regular meetings with Government personnel and other Contractors at the cemetery to coordinate contract work schedules and contract related issues. Communication with the COR is strongly encouraged. Burial activities at NCA shall take precedence over contract work activities. Work activity and noise cannot disturb Burial Services. Trucks and workers are prohibited from passing through the service area during this period. 

Cemetery Activities: To cause the least possible interference with cemetery activities, contract personnel will stop (cease) all work in areas where burials are taking place. As a general "rule-of-thumb", work should not take place within 1,000 feet of an ongoing committal service or ceremony. The Site Manager will re-direct work throughout the rest of the Cemetery   so that productive use of labor and equipment is assured, and downtime is avoided. If the Contractor fails to re-direct employees away from an event in a timely manner, the COR may then do so. 

A.4.6 SNOW REMOVAL 

The Contractor will be responsible for the removal of snow from all roads, sidewalks, walkways (including sidewalk that runs parallel to the cemetery along Jamaica Avenue), steps, around the lodge, restrooms, committal shelters and flagpole. Removal of snow on all sidewalks, walkways & steps will be done using snow shovels or walk behind mechanical snow throwers. The use of small tractors fitted with snow plows will not be permitted on sidewalks. Snow on cemetery roads will be removed with a truck mounted snow plow. 

The Contractor will be notified by the COR when to begin the removal / treatment of these areas for snow. Treatment of these areas will also include weather occurrences that include freezing rain, ice and hail. 

The Contractor will apply the proper chemical (calcium chloride only) to all the required surfaces (sidewalks, walkways, steps, building entrances) after complete removal of snow has been accomplished. The product to be applied will be provided by the cemetery and will be applied according to proper standards and specifications. Rock salt only will be applied via a truck mounted spreader to all cemetery roadways after plowing has been completed. 

Contractor shall take precautions to prevent damage to buildings, roadways, sidewalks, curbing, trees, headstones and markers by equipment used to remove snow and ice. 

Contractor is responsible for repairing any damage caused by equipment in the performance of snow and ice removal. 

The Contractor will be expected to remove snow for a maximum of ten (10) occurrences as needed / directed by the COR. An individual occurrence of snow removal begins when the Contractor is notified by the COR to start snow removal operations and ends once snow / freezing precipitation has stopped falling and all required areas are free of snow and or ice and safely passable for employees and visitors. If Contractor employees complete the removal process and have all required areas cleared as expected and freezing precipitation (snow, freezing rain) begins again, then this would constitute a second occurrence for snow removal. 

Contractor personnel are expected to begin snow removal operations within two (2) hours after being notified by the cemetery / COR that snow removal is needed. The only reasons that Contractor personnel should be hindered from performing the snow removal operations would be in the case of extreme temperatures / weather conditions that could negatively affect the health and welfare of contract personnel or if a  State of Emergency  is declared by either local or state government requiring that only emergency / essential personnel are allowed to travel on local roads. 

A.4.7 RAISING AND LOWERING OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FLAG 

SCOPE: Work shall consist of raising and lowering the United States of America Flag. The flag must be lowered and raised when determined by Presidential proclamation or by the New York State Governor. 

REQUIREMENTS 

Upon Presidential proclamation or by direction of the New York State Governor for any specific occasion or occurrence calling for the flag to be lowered at half-staff, the Contractor will lower the flag for the specified time determined and then raise it to full staff upon completion of the designated time. 

A.5 CONTRACT MANAGEMENT
