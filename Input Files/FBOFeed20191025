<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Belvoir Division C is seeking sources on behalf of the Combat Capability Development Command (CCDC) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) to develop a Fully Digital Soldier Architecture (FDSA) for the Special Products and Prototyping Division (SPPD) Quick Response Branch (QRB). This program is in partnership with the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and Program Manager Soldiers, Sensors, and Lasers (PM SSL).</p>
<p>The intent of this Market Survey is to identify potential sources capable of developing FDSA prototype software. This software would primarily be in relation to currently in-development fully digital night vision goggle systems. All interested firms should consider responding to this RFI, even smaller firms, those firms not currently working in the digital night vision mission area, and/or firms that may only have expertise in some, even if not all, of the desired capabilities discussed below. The transition to digital technology for night vision devices offers many opportunities for overmatch capabilities which requires a paradigm shift to take advantage of. The objective of the FDSA effort is to develop a novel software paradigm to maximize the advantages of a fully digital suite of personnel equipment for dismounted Warfighters. The architecture must combine a fully digital visual augmentation system (VAS), Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) enabled end user device (EUD), tactical radio, and ancillary digital equipment (i.e. weapon sights, small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), etc) in order to provide capabilities not possible with analog systems.</p>
<p>Specifically, NVESD intends the FDSA program to demonstrate and evaluate the potential for a fully digital architecture to enhance the implementation of augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). This architecture should take advantage of hi-frame rate digital image feeds, 2-D and 3-D terrain data, and full color displays to enhance pose estimation, provide a more intuitive and ergonomic AR interface, and a more realistic VR experience.</p>
<p>A successful FDSA shall implement digital image processing to improve the quality of the image presented to the eye. Such processes may include by are not limited to noise reduction, filtering, foveated imagery, smart fusion, etc.</p>
<p>Further, FDSA should implement an intelligent toggling system that will modulate power and dataflow throughout the system. This architecture must result in demonstrable power savings while also enhancing user ingestion of information by displaying only channels that actively contain relevant information. This must include a user override that allows the system operator to easily take complete control of the system.</p>
<p>FDSA should allow individual users to customize their digital network, based on both their preferences as well as mission requirements. Customizable facets of the system should include degree of automation, end-state priority (up-time, detection, recognition, etc), and pieces of kit that constitute the network.</p>
<p>Any FDSA solution will need to have a positive impact on size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) conditions. . NVESD envisions FDSA as a system that combines with existing hardware to make it work more effectively and efficiently, reducing redundancy while and maximizing the benefit of digital equipment. However, NVESD acknowledges that additional hardware may be necessary or desirable to add functionality. If additional hardware is recommended by the proposing party, it will be integrated into the Warfighter load-out elegantly and ergonomically.</p>
<p>Hardware in the architecture may communicate wirelessly (optional) but must communicate via a hardwired connection. If wireless functionality is available, acceptable communication methods shall be via Bluetooth and/or WIFI (i.e. 802.11g) and/or via Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) and/or Ultra Wide Band (UWB). Hard-wired interfaces shall be USB 2.0 or newer. The tactical communications infrastructure shall be based around TAK. The radio shall be either wave relay radio such as an MPU-5 or wideband waveform such as a Harris 152A/163.</p>
<p>New technologies and capabilities frequently adds, deletes, or modifies a Soldier's tasks. New technologies affect how a Soldier performs tactical tasks; often inserting changes in job requirements, enhancing or degrading wearer confidence, and bringing changes to training requirements. A poorly designed FDSA has the potential for significantly increasing the workload on a user by adding both information-gathering and decision-making tasks to his existing workload. A poorly designed architecture, that reduces system runtime, induces motion sickness, increases workload and reading time, causes discomfort, overheats, or requires constant user input, will negatively affect individual performance and confidence. Rather the successful architecture should minimize the additional cognitive workload that it places on the wearer and maximize hardware performance.</p>
<p>The US Government is interested in obtaining data rights to proposed FDSA solutions to utilize, transition, and advance the military architecture of the future. This may include competitive future use and the ability to obtain integration/operation/maintenance/sustainment/upgrade services from third parties (i.e., Contractors other than the original manufacturer or developer). Responses to this RFI should address what the path forward is for the US Government to purchase data rights to FDSA solutions necessary to achieve Government objectives.</p>
<p>The following aspects of the FDSA design will be critically examined by NVESD.</p>
<p>&bull; The architecture should utilize available digital image channels to provide depth of field that (T) will identify the ground plane, (O) provide a close-range full depth map of the environment.<br />&bull; Use 2-D to 2-D, 2-D to 3-D, and 3-D to 3-D registration techniques to enhance the user pose estimate.<br />&bull; The architecture should improve the flow of information to the user.<br />&bull; The architecture should result in measurable power savings by implementing throttling methods.<br />&bull; The architecture should automate certain processes to reduce cognitive load on the user and enhance performance.<br />&bull; The architecture should be compatible with common personal equipment (for example, handheld GPS devices) for dismounts and be in full compliance with ICDs that are being developed by the US Army (to be provided no later than the start of any FDSA effort).<br />&bull; The architecture should be configurable by the user to suit mission needs and personal preferences.<br />&bull; The architecture should simplify the presentation of data entry and system control options.<br />&bull; The architecture-equipped display should not induce motion sickness, cause discomfort, or require constant adjustment.<br />&bull; The architecture-equipped system should not grow in size and weight, should not draw excessive amounts of power, should efficiently manage its thermal burden, and should be intuitive to use.<br />&bull; What data rights will the Government be entitled to if the Government decided to procure the solution described in response to this RFI?</p>
<p>The objective of the FDSA program is to demonstrate and evaluate the potential benefits of a fully digital system. Prototypes may not be fully functional if they adequately demonstrate the achievability of novel methods to enhance performance of both the user and the system.</p>
<p>These are the questions that the FDSA program will address:</p>
<p>&bull; Can advanced 3-D methods be feasibly implemented on a system born by a dismounted Warfighter to enhance user performance and ingestion of information?</p>
<p>&bull; Does the presence of a near-eye full color digital display enhance user experience of AR/VR?</p>
<p>&bull; Can power throttling significantly enhance system up-time?</p>
<p>&bull; Can distribution of processing burden be used to improve system performance?</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a White Paper due no later than 14 November 2019 22:00 PST, and submitted via e-mail only to joanna.m.jones8.civ@mail.mil. White Papers shall be submitted in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) format and should be limited to 10 pages, double spaced, 12 font.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI may mark proprietary information in the White Paper as such. However, by submitting a response to the RFI, the respondent agrees the Government may reproduce and use the information submitted, even if marked proprietary, to the extent necessary to evaluate the White Paper. Respondents are advised that the information submitted to the Government in response to this RFI may be released to non-Government support contractors. The following Government support contractors may assist the Government with reviewing White Papers submitted in response to this RFI: CACI, Inc; Polaris Alpha, (a Parsons Company); LKC Consulting, LLC. These support contractors are subject to DFARS 252.227-7025 (DFARS 227.7103-7 provides that requirement for use and non-disclosure agreements does not apply to Government contractors which require access to a third party's data or software for the performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.)</p>
<p>Section 1 of the White Paper shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum: Company name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated contracting points of contact. In addition, respondents shall provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.

8. GENERAL:

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements.  VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures comply with VA directive requirements.
 Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.  Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.  Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval.  The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above-mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COR.

Security Incident Investigation:
The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach.  Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

Liquidated Damages for Data Breach:
Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above.  Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data.  Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis.  Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);

Description of the event, including:

date of occurrence;

data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;

Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;

Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;

Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;

The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);

Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;

Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;

Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and

Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

Notification;

One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;

Data breach analysis;

Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;

One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and

Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-days  notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

Training:
All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

training and annually complete required security training;

Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and

Successfully complete any additional information security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document   e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]

The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.

Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until the training and documents are complete.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.203 which prescribes a mandatory requirement for a 15-day pre&#8208;solicitation notification. The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) intent to issue a solicitation for a full-and-open competition.
<p>The mission of the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Office of Safety (HSA) is to exercise leadership throughout the multidisciplinary highway community to make the Nation's surface transportation system safer for all road users. This is accomplished through HSA programs and initiatives, as well as activities of its partners, customers, and others (including other FHWA offices and Federal agencies, State and local government agencies, various public and private organizations and industries, the public, and when appropriate, other countries).</p>
<p>The objectives of HSA through this requirement involve reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries by reducing the number of crashes and mitigating the impacts during and after the crashes. HSA provides leadership, in coordination with our partners, to research, develop and deploy life saving strategies and programs. Areas of focus include: The Highway Safety Improvement Program, Intersection Safety, Local and Rural Road Safety, Pedestrian and Bicycling Safety, Roadway Departure Safety, Roadway Safety Data Program, and Speed Management as well as other initiatives. The Office of Safety also takes on safety initiatives and programs that provide support to FHWA's partners and customers associated with road, vehicle, and road user improvements. Improving road safety involves the coordination of the 4 E's (Engineering, Education, Enforcement and Emergency Medical Services) by employing a multi-disciplinary approach to addressing challenges.</p>
<p>HSA has a need for technical and general services to support its program, including policy/regulatory analysis, analysis of program delivery approaches, safety evaluations, data analysis, meeting support, course development and delivery, and marketing and communication strategies/activities.</p>
<p>The solicitation and all related documents will be released electronically via the Government Point of Entry (GPE) otherwise known as Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) or www.fbo.gov. As such, no written, telephonic or other type of request for an advance copy of the solicitation will be entertained. Potential offerors are encouraged to register on www.fbo.gov to receive any further information in reference to the subject action inclusive of any announcements, and/or amendments to the solicitation after its release.</p>
<p>The FHWA intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts as a result of the solicitation. The period of performance shall not exceed 60 months from the effective date of the contract. The NAICS Code for this effort is 561990 with a size standard of $15 Million.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. A Request for Proposals (RFP) is anticipated to be published in the near future. Once the RFP is posted, all interested, responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the FHWA.</p>

<p>Introduction<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the lead federal agency for the conduct of biomedical research both within the United States and internationally. Due to the prominence of the NIH in the field of biomedical research, its vast network of intramural and extramural researcher and its ability to mobilize intellectual and material resources to solve known and emerging health issues, the government has tasked NIH with mobilizing civilian bio-defense research. To support this research, there is an on-going need to have available high and maximum containment laboratory facilities (Biosafety Level 3 and 4) where research can be performed and, if necessary, intervene in the event of a regional or national emergency. An essential part of this bio-defense program is meeting the long-term need in safely managing and operating biological research laboratories. There is a continuing need to recruit and train qualified individuals who can ensure the safe operation of these facilities where research is conducted at the highest levels of containment. These individuals need to be trained in multiple safety disciplines including risk assessment, operations, engineering, and industrial hygiene. The Division of Occupational Health and Safety (DOHS), Office of Research Services (ORS), is the organization responsible for experience in the operation of maximum/high level biocontainment facilities. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) has supported the DOHS in providing a biosafety and biocontainment training program, at the professional level, to meet the growing national need for biosafety and biocontainment professionals. Through an NIH Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA), the NIH National Biosafety and Biocontainment Training Program (NBBTP) provides an intensive two-year fellowship specifically targeting biosafety. The current Program recruits and trains professionals from across scientific disciplines in the field of biosafety and biocontainment. <br />Description</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all of the necessary personnel and resources in order to oversee, manage, and improve all components of the NBBTP/IRTA.</p>

<p>1. Administration of NIH NBBTP/IRTA Two-Year Fellowship Program<br />2. NBBTP Scientific Advisory Board<br />3. Intellectual Property<br />4. Approvals<br />5. Branding<br />6. Travel<br />7. NBBTP Website<br />8. Meeting<br />9. Program Eligibility</p>
<p>The anticipated start date is on/or about February 16, 2020 with a 7-month Base and 4 one-year Options.<br />Instructions</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) anticipates soliciting quotations and subsequently awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for Anesthesia Systems for the Veteran Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Healthcare System (VANWIHS). Acquisition of these items are part of the initial outfitting and activation of the new Ambulatory Care Center (ACC) in Omaha, NE.

DESCRIPTION
A contract is needed for the ACC for below listed BRAND NAME ONLY GE Healthcare equipment.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/MANUFACTURERS CUTSHEETS
The contractor will be required to include manufacturer cut-sheets/specifications for items quoted.

**See attached STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
**See attached BRAND NAME J&A


ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as unrestricted.  The applicable NAICS code is 339112.  The solicitation will be issued on or about November 8, 2019 for approximately seven (7) calendar days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety. In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at jacquelyn.wise@va.gov AND michelle.rhodes@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The government is seeking potential sources with the capability to provide new ground based, geodesic radomes a global satellite weather system.<br />The Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) was awarded mission workload by the USAF to procure and install 18 foot and 26 foot radomes in support of weather systems located around the globe. There are multiple global satellite terminals world-wide that provide operational missions with tactical meteorological information for specific locations. The satellite sensors enable the ability for both satellites and meteorologists to detect weather conditions such as thunderstorms, volcanic ash, and fog which in turn relay the collected data to commercial and military aircraft.<br />The antennae for these systems is susceptible to damage by the weather and requires the protection of radomes. The geostationary antennas require an unobstructed equator facing view to the site's primary and secondary assigned geostationary METSAT. The polar antennas require a 360-degree unobstructed view. The indoor equipment requires a normal temperature controlled electronic equipment environment.</p>
<p>Users worldwide access the network data server directly via unsecure (NIPR) and secure (SIPR) communications using specialized software, providing robust imagery analysis capability. SIPRNet users also employ specialized software to access data re-hosted on Mirrored Data Servers (MDS) located at data centers. Multiple systems located throughout the world provide global geostationary coverage and extensive polar coverage. <br />These systems provides real-time imagery and model input data that directly supports all DoD services' wartime mission execution, resource protection, and training missions worldwide; Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), national agencies, and other U.S. Government agencies including the U.S. Forest Service and the National Weather Service (NWS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>

OBJECTIVES:  This requirement includes providing physical security services (armed, unarmed, and K-9) for all areas identified.  The mission of the protective force contractor is the physical protection of critical security interests to include Classified and Sensitive Information, Property, Classified and Unclassified Facilities and personnel.  A successful entity would be required to provide trained armed, unarmed, and K-9 security personnel to fulfill the functions of the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The primary functions required for an effort of this nature will include, but not limited to the following: 

 Armed, unarmed, and K-9 security services; patrols; entry(ies) control; badging; various post assignments; and reception service(s). This will include approximately 200 full time employees manning approximately 85 posts.

 Providing competent, trained, uniformed security and K9 officers who meet the standards for providing private guard services in the applicable locality as listed above. 

 Contract management, supervision, manpower (technically trained personnel to provide routine and emergency site security services protection and support services), training, screening, equipment, supplies, licenses, permits, certifications, insurance, pre-employment screenings, reports, files, and any other resources necessary to satisfactorily perform the requirements of this effort. All work performed must satisfy the requirements of all laws, regulations, DOE orders, directives, and guidelines. 

 Provide security services twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, and 365 days per year (24/7/365). The level of effort will be determined by the specific Security Condition (SECON) level the DOE is under at any time as well as response to short-term events such as other unforeseen non-emergency or emergency situations.

 Responsible for conducting adequate background checks to ensure that personnel hired are capable of obtaining and maintaining an L security clearance with the exception of key Personnel who will be required to obtain and maintain a Q clearance. The Contractor shall provide trained and qualified Basic Security Police Officer personnel to support all identified locations. 

 Company must be capable of obtaining and maintaining a Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) Facility Clearance and Contract Security Classification Specification (CSCS) clearance.

 Training shall be provided per the National Training Center certification guidelines, 10 CFR 1046, SPO I (as applicable), and all applicable DOE requirements.

Adequate care and transportation shall be provided meeting all applicable state laws. Canines shall be trained and certified by the DOE Canine Performance Testing Protocol Standard, DOE-STF-1225-2017. Explosive Detector Dog teams may also be trained and qualified consistent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (ATF) National Odor Recognition Testing Standard (NORT).  

The information gathered from this sources sought notice will be used by the Government in determining the appropriate type of contract (expected to be predominately fixed-price), period of performance, set-side requirements, and used to refine the requirements for these services.  NETL anticipates that a successor entity would provide the core competencies led by experienced key personnel backed by a corporate structure experienced in providing these type of physical security services.

<p>Background Information:</p>
<p>NIDA has published a notice of intent to publish a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), "Step Up for Substance Use Disorder (SUD): A Drug Target Initiative for Scientists Engaged in Fundamental Research."

In addition, NIDA will provide in-kind access to drug discovery and development expertise, business strategy and commercialization support, and assistance in the company/startup formation, as needed. For each project funded under this FOA, the NIDA will assemble an NIH expert panel called a Project Development Team (PDT) comprising of Program Official (PO), Science Officer (SO), the Principal Investigator/Project Director (PI/PD) and appropriate NIH expert consultants. Together, the team will create a credible thesis for how the PI/PD will address an important SUD issue in a transformative way, differentiate from other approaches, and create a path for progressively de-risking that opportunity.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION <br />The Electronic Warfare Integrated Laboratories (EWIL), code 45Q000E, at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), Point Mugu, California currently utilizes an existing Electronic Warfare Systems Integration Test Environment (EW SITE) radar environment simulator to support system performance evaluation and integration of various Electronic Warfare (EW) systems.
<p>DISCLAIMER <br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND <br />The EW SITE system was developed and manufactured by Textron AAI under a sole source contract with the United States Navy to test EW systems of the EA-6B, EA-18G, F/A-18, MH-60, E-2C, P-8A and F-35 (JSF) platforms, and corresponding systems and subsystems. The EW SITE provides digitally controlled Radio Frequency (RF), phase, amplitude, and time based modulations that represent threat radars.  Adding test assets to the EWIL provides a more robust threat environment in the form of a high pulse density, dynamic, simulated flight environment.</p>
<p>This requirement will provide a follow-on Single Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) to an existing Single-Award IDIQ (N6893616D0001) with Textron AAI Corporation.  The IDIQ with Textron AAI was not a small business set-aside and the contract was awarded using the 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) statutory authority to permit other than full and open competition.  Ordering on the current IDIQ ends in January 2021.  Requests for information associated with N6893616D0001 will be addressed through the NAVAIR Freedom of Information (FOIA) website at http://foia.navair.navy.mil.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES<br />This requirement will provide for the development of EW SITE systems and sub-system components for domestic and FMS customers in the NAWCWD radar environment simulator to support system performance evaluation and integration of various EW systems.  This will result in expanded capabilities and allow the EWIL to continue to efficiently develop and test current and future EW systems and capabilities in support of aircraft platform integration and test.  EW SITE system supports System Configuration Sets (SCS) from multiple platforms and provides consistency with the Advanced Weapons Laboratory at China Lake, CA.</p>
<p>The EW SITE components shall be compatible with the government's existing EW SITE LITE system delivered under contracts N68936-09-C-0138, N68936-13-C-0161 and N68936-16-D-0001.  The same Configuration compatibility with existing EW SITE system components is required to enable sharing of hardware components between existing threat simulators and leveraging of existing government-developed threat scenario software.  The EW SITE components shall simulate threat and friendly radar systems, communications, and Data Link systems for performing systems integration and test on EA-6B, EA-18G, F/A-18, MH-60, E-2C, P-8A and F-35 (JSF) platforms, and corresponding systems and sub-systems.</p>
<p>Required Hardware:</p>
<p>HARDWARE A2PATS SYSTEM	QTY<br />Synthetic Simulator Instruments (SSIs)	93<br />RF Switch Matrices	13<br />Integrated EW Cab	5<br />Stimulus Cab	2<br />Spares	8<br />A2DSG	11<br />A2DRI	12</p>
<p>This contract will also provide incidental services for on-call and on-site maintenance, repair and system upgrades, including replacement parts for existing systems as well as the newly acquired systems.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP):

Introduction:

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate contractor actions while implementing this SOW.  It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed objective on the Service Delivery Summary (SDS) in the custodial contract.

The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish.

This QASP is based on the premise the government desires to maintain a quality standard in operating, maintaining, and repairing facilities and that a service contract to provide the service is the best means of achieving that objective.

The contractor, and not the government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  The role of the government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.

In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality.  The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions.  The first major step to ensuring a  self-correcting  contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success.

Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program.

The COEs have significant homeland security-related science, technology, engineering, and mathematics capabilities to provide technical services to DHS including: subject matter expertise, laboratories, engineering and other testing facilities, data bases, computer models, computer software and hardware, analytical tools, etc.</p>
<p>The COEs are directly aligned with one or more of the DHS Components, creating linkages between DHS and other customers, as well as providing enduring multi-disciplinary research, development, testing, evaluation, education and training capabilities for DHS and the Nation. The COEs are authorized by Congress and chosen by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) through a competitive selection process. The designation of "Center of Excellence" is awarded to a university that brings together leading experts and researchers from other institutions, agencies, laboratories, think tanks, and the private sector to conduct multidisciplinary research and education for homeland security solutions.</p>
<p>The S&amp;T OUP's mission is to maximize DHS's return on investment in university-based research and education. OUP funds grants and cooperative agreements to the COEs to establish fundamental research and education programs in specific multi-disciplinary subject matter areas at each COE. DHS S&amp;T expects the universities that comprise the COEs to obtain additional sources of funding beyond OUP's base funding in order to support more directed research, development, testing, evaluation, education and training. Other S&amp;T Divisions and DHS Components frequently need to access the capabilities created by the COEs at the lead or partner universities, e.g. for directed research, analysis, technical services, both unclassified and classified, as well as DHS-specific education and training that cannot be performed under S&amp;T's grants and cooperative agreements. Through this RFI, DHS S&amp;T is pursuing funding strategies to meet emerging requirements.</p>
<p>1.2 Discussion</p>
<p>DHS S&amp;T seeks comments on the use of a BOA to accommodate DHS requirements for COE research, analysis, and technical services (unclassified and classified), as well as DHS-specific science and engineering education and training. DHS S&amp;T proposed to award a BOA to the current and future COE research lead university, to be renewed once after five years, and again at the end of its period of performance, renewals being subject to suitable COE progress in research, development, test, evaluation, education and training. OUP will determine the need for a BOA for the COE research lead by matching university capabilities with DHS's requirements and needs (S&amp;T will address high priority requirements first).</p>
<p>The Center of Excellence for Cross-Border Threat Screening and Supply Chain Defense (CBTS), a new DHS COE, was established in 2018. A BOA enables DHS components to access the capabilities, experience, research results, technology, models and data that the COEs have developed with DHS funding.<br />Characteristics:<br />o Versatile umbrella agreements between a federal agency (DHS in this case) and performing institutions (the lead university from the COE)<br />o Enables contracting officers within the funding agency to issue task orders to the performer that are within the scope of the BOA<br />o Designed to address the needs of DHS for specific research questions with deliverables on an identified cost and schedule performance<br />o Awarded for a five-year period of performance</p>
<p>The task/delivery orders issued under the BOA will be issued non-competitively to the BOA recipient. The total estimated annual value of all orders issued under each BOA is one to five million dollars ($1M-$5M). Experience indicates that current projects have been in the range of $25,000 to $1,000,000 in value. The value of task orders under a new BOA may be lower or higher. DHS S&amp;T anticipates that the COE research lead university will use BOA subcontracts with current or new organizations to access the best possible skills, knowledge, and capabilities needed to address each task order.</p>
<p>The DHS Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) S&amp;T Acquisition Division will issue and administer the BOA. DHS Components' contracting offices will issue and administer their task orders under the BOA, subject to a determination by the S&amp;T contracting officer's representative (COR) that the requested goods or services are within the scope of the BOA. The OPO will publish and issue an ordering guide to explain to ordering officers at all DHS Components how to issue task orders under the BOA. Task orders issued under the BOA will be predominantly firm fixed price. However, the BOA will contain pertinent terms and conditions that will facilitate the issuance of fixed price or cost reimbursement type task orders as determined by the ordering contracting officer of the relevant DHS component.</p>
<p>Designated ordering officers at DHS offices and Components will be able to issue task orders under the COE BOA for unclassified or classified research, scientific or technical analyses, and technical services related to homeland security challenges and solutions. Orders will fit within the broad scope of COE capabilities and may include:</p>
<p>a) Creating technologies and models<br />b) Utilizing facilities and technologies<br />c) Providing subject matter expert review, presentation, or testimony<br />d) Testing and evaluation<br />e) Conducting analyses or assessments<br />f) Developing and delivering education and training materials<br />g) Performing other relevant services within an existing COE scope of work.</p>
<p>CBTS will research and develop solutions, protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations that detect, assess, and respond to known and unknown biological threats and other hazards that could adversely impact the Nation's people, agriculture, and economy. CBTS will aid DHS in reducing risks posed by biological threats and other hazards encountered at borders, ports of entry, and within the global supply chain. By researching the countering biological threats in supply chains, CBTS will assist DHS operations that protect and mitigate threats to the global supply chain and reduce the risk of exposing people and infrastructures to new and evolving biological threats. Task orders issued under the BOA will fall within this scope. <br />This Center will support DHS by improving its operational capabilities that contribute the Nation's layered defense. CBTS will work with S&amp;T Offices, such as the Offices of Science &amp; Engineering, and Mission &amp; Capability Support, and DHS Component agencies (e.g. United States Coast Guard (USCG), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD), and the Office of Intelligence &amp; Analysis (I&amp;A)).</p>
<p>2.0 RESPONSES REQUESTED</p>
<p>a) Mandatory Responses/Questions:<br />1) Describe your university's/organization's knowledge, experience, and capacity to administer FAR-based contracts and, in particular, BOAs.<br />2) Describe your university's/organization's willingness to accept a FAR-based BOA and task/delivery orders under the BOA in fulfillment of future DHS research, analysis, and technical services requirements.<br />3) Does the award of a BOA impose a burden on your university/organization and on your partner organizations that you cannot accommodate given your institution's current skills, capabilities, experience, and resources? Please explain.<br />4) Which FAR-based contract type is preferred for orders issued under a BOA, if awarded to your university/organization for COE-related research, analysis, and technical services? [For example: Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Time and Materials (T&amp;M).] Please rank order, from most preferred to least preferred, the contract types listed above.<br />5) Are you willing and able (having the necessary facilities, practices, procedures, etc.) to accept and perform sensitive but unclassified (SBU) task orders under a FAR-based BOA? <br />6) Are you willing and able (having the necessary facilities, practices, procedures, etc.) to accept and perform classified task orders under a FAR-based BOA?<br />7) Describe your understanding and management practices for advancing technologies in the disciplines identified in Section 1.2. This includes describing processes in use at the submitting organization that manages the advancement of research through commercialization and market deployment.<br />8) Describe the kinds of research, analysis, and technical service projects that your COE/organization might perform for DHS Components under the aforementioned BOA. Include project examples.<br />9) What other questions or concerns should DHS S&amp;T consider with respect to implementing this BOA contracting approach?<br />10) Since research performed under this BOA will address DHS mission needs, the availability of the results of such research for publication might be limited. Does this present an issue?<br />11) Are there any issues regarding intellectual property rights that DHS should consider as it prepares its BOA for issuance? DHS expects to use the FAR clause on data rights 52.227-14. Pursuant to that clause, DHS expects to review scientific articles prior to publication to ensure that DHS's security &amp; mission needs are considered.</p>

ADDENDUM B   VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE

APPLICABLE PARAGRAPHS TAILORED FROM: THE VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE, VA HANDBOOK 6500.6, APPENDIX C, MARCH 12, 2010

GENERAL

Contractors, Contractor personnel, Subcontractors, and Subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

A Contractor/Subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, Subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

All Contractors, Subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for Contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates (e.g. Business Associate Agreement, Section 3G), the Contractor/Subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. 

The Contractor or Subcontractor must notify the CO immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the Contractor or Subcontractor s employ. The CO must also be notified immediately by the Contractor or Subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

Information made available to the Contractor or Subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the Contractor/Subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of VA. This clause expressly limits the Contractor/Subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the Contractors/Subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the Contractor must ensure that VA information is returned to VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of Contractor and Subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

Prior to termination or completion of this contract, Contractor/Subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the Contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a Contractor/Subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the Contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA CO within 30 days of termination of the contract.

The Contractor/Subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 

The Contractor/Subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on Contractor/Subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the Contractor/Subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

If VA determines that the Contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the Contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated Business Associate Agreement (BAA) must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.05, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 

The Contractor/Subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

The Contractor/Subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the Contractor/Subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA prior written approval. The Contractor/Subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA CO for response.

Notwithstanding the provision above, the Contractor/Subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the Contractor/Subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that Contractor/Subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA CO for response.

For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require Assessment and Authorization (A&A) or a Memorandum of Understanding-Interconnection Security Agreement (MOU-ISA) for system interconnection, the Contractor/Subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COR.


INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT


Information systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities shall comply with all VA directives developed in accordance with FISMA, HIPAA, NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems. This includes standards for the protection of electronic PHI, outlined in 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C, information and system security categorization level designations in accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200 with implementation of all baseline security controls commensurate with the FIPS 199 system security categorization (reference VA Handbook 6500, Risk Management Framework for VA Information Systems   Tier 3: VA Information Security Program, and the TIC Reference Architecture). During the development cycle a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must be completed, provided to the COR, and approved by the VA Privacy Service in accordance with Directive 6508, Implementation of Privacy Threshold Analysis and Privacy Impact Assessment.

The Contractor/Subcontractor shall certify to the COR that applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the VA Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), and the common security configuration guidelines provided by NIST or VA. This includes Internet Explorer 11 configured to operate on Windows 7 and future versions, as required.

The standard installation, operation, maintenance, updating, and patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the VA approved and FDCC configuration. Information technology staff must also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default  program files  directory and silently install and uninstall.

Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.

The security controls must be designed, developed, approved by VA, and implemented in accordance with the provisions of VA security system development life cycle as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems, VA Handbook 6500, Risk Management Framework for VA Information Systems   Tier 3:  VA Information Security Program and VA Handbook 6500.5, Incorporating Security and Privacy in System Development Lifecycle.

The Contractor/Subcontractor is required to design, develop, or operate a System of Records Notice (SOR) on individuals to accomplish an agency function subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, (as amended), Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and applicable agency regulations. Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of criminal and civil penalties.

The Contractor/Subcontractor agrees to:

Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies:

The Systems of Records (SOR); and

The design, development, or operation work that the Contractor/Subcontractor is to perform;

Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and

Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph (c), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a SOR.

In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the Contractor/Subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.

 Operation of a System of Records  means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records.

 Record  means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and contains the person s name, or identifying number, symbol, or any other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph.

 System of Records  means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.

The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as  Systems ), throughout the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods. This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hot fixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware. The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems.

The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than _____days. 

When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within _____ days.

All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure. Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the CO and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.

INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE

For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, Contractors/Subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The Contractor s security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA network involving VA information must be in accordance with the TIC Reference Architecture and reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.  For Cloud Services hosting, the Contractor shall also ensure compliance with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). 

Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.

Outsourcing (Contractor facility, Contractor equipment or Contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires A&A of the Contractor s systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Assessment, Authorization and Continuous Monitoring of VA Information Systems and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (Government facility or Government equipment) Contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection security agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.

The Contractor/Subcontractor s system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA CO and the ISO for entry into the VA POA&M management process. The Contractor/Subcontractor must use the VA POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the Government. Contractor/Subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with Contractor/Subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the A&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, and Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new A&A would be necessary.

The Contractor/Subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COR. The Government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using Government personnel or another Contractor/Subcontractor. The Contractor/Subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.

VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or Contractor/Subcontractor owned equipment or software on the VA network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for Government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.

All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the Contractor/Subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the Contractor/Subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the Contractors/Subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to VA for sanitization or destruction or the Contractor/Subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.

Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:

Vendor must accept the system without the drive;

VA s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or

VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.

Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for VA to retain the hard drive, then;

The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and

Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.

A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The Contractor/Subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the Contractor/Subcontractor has access.

To the extent known by the Contractor/Subcontractor, the Contractor/Subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the Contractor/Subcontractor considers relevant.

With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the Contractor/Subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The Contractor, its employees, and its Subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The Contractor/Subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the Contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the Contractor/Subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.  However, it is the policy of VA to forgo collection of liquidated damages in the event the Contractor provides payment of actual damages in an amount determined to be adequate by the agency.

The Contractor/Subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
Description of the event, including:
date of occurrence;
data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Breaches Involving Sensitive Personal Information, as appropriate; and
Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the Contractor shall be responsible for paying to VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

Notification;
One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
Data breach analysis;
Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING


On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the Contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day s notice, at the request of the Government, the Contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a Government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The Government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		3612-00-NIB-0010<br />Name:		3D Printer Filament, Nylon, Natural, 1kg of 1.75 mm<br />Description:	Nylon filament on spools for durability, minimal shrinkage, a vast range of chemical resistance, and printable at temperatures as low as 250C-255C.

Filament is black and 1kg of 1.75 mm. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		3612-00-NIB-0007<br />Name:		3D Printer Filament, Polylactic Acid, Natural, 1kg of 1.75 mm<br />Description:	Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament is a bio-plastic material for applications that require a tight dimensional accuracy.

Filament is natural and 1kg of 1.75 mm. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		3612-00-NIB-0006<br />Name:		3D Printer Filament, Polylactic Acid, White, 1kg of 1.75 mm<br />Description:	Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament is a bio-plastic material for applications that require a tight dimensional accuracy. SKILCRAFT PLA Pro has high heat resistance and is easy to print. PLA is also environmentally preferred for its odorless quality and naturally degradation when exposed to the environment. Filament is white and 1kg of 1.75 mm. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		3612-00-NIB-0005<br />Name:		3D Printer Filament, Polylactic Acid, Black, 1kg of 1.75 mm<br />Description:	Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament is a bio-plastic material for applications that require a tight dimensional accuracy. SKILCRAFT PLA Pro has high heat resistance and is easy to print. PLA is also environmentally preferred for its odorless quality and naturally degradation when exposed to the environment. Filament is black and 1kg of 1.75 mm. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		3612-00-NIB-0004<br />Name:		3D Printer Filament, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, Natural, 1kg of 1.75 mm<br />Description:	Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) filament on spools for printing strong, temperature-resistant 3D parts. ABS combines the strength and rigidity of polymers with the toughness of rubber. ABS is hard, glossy, tough, and has electrical insulation properties. Filament is natural and 1kg of 1.75 mm. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		3612-00-NIB-0003<br />Name:		3D Printer Filament, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, White, 1kg of 1.75 mm<br />Description:	Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) filament on spools for printing strong, temperature-resistant 3D parts. ABS combines the strength and rigidity of polymers with the toughness of rubber. ABS is hard, glossy, tough, and has electrical insulation properties. Filament is white and 1kg of 1.75 mm. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		3612-00-NIB-0002<br />Name:		3D Printer Filament, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, Black, 1kg of 1.75 mm<br />Description:	Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) filament on spools for printing strong, temperature-resistant 3D parts. ABS combines the strength and rigidity of polymers with the toughness of rubber. ABS is hard, glossy, tough, and has electrical insulation properties. Filament is black and 1kg of 1.75 mm. UOI is EA.</p>
<p><br />Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Philadelphia, PA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			3612-00-NIB-0010<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	MakeShaper 727559902486; NYLON NATURAL</p>
<p>NSN:			3612-00-NIB-0008<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	MatterHackers MCR8GQZT; 3D SYSTEMS 3D PRINTER NYLON FILAMENT - B</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than November 8, 2019 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>The closing date for this intent to award notice is November 8, 2019 at 4:00 pm ET. Anticipated award date is on or about November 11, 2019. Point of contact for this intent to award notice is sheena.d.jordan@uscg.mil.</p>

<CONTACT>DeAnna L. Mannel, Contract Specialist, Phone 916-557-6690, Email deanna.l.mannel@usace.army.mil - Melissa A. DeNigris, Contract Specialist, Phone 9165575137, Email Melissa.A.DeNigris@usace.army.mil
<DESC>This is a <strong>PREQUALIFICATION OF SOURCES</strong> announcement, issued in accordance with DFARS 236.272 and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Acquisition Instruction (UAI) 5236.272. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Respondents will be notified of the results of the Prequalification of Sources Selection.
<p><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Sacramento District is seeking to create a Prequalified Sources List (PSL) for levee improvement cutoff wall construction within the Sacramento Valley. The objective of the Prequalification of Sources process is to identify and select responding firms that demonstrate the capacity and capability to successfully support critical USACE cutoff wall construction projects and thus establish a PSL. Identifying and selecting prequalified sources will be based solely on the responding firm's ability to meet the specific criteria that assess the firm's bonding capability, capability to concurrently complete large construction projects, previous experience completing a large cutoff wall construction project, financial accounting capabilities to support potential Government fixed-price contracts, and past performance. The selection process will be objective in that responding firms either meet or fail to meet the criteria. Failure to meet any one of the criteria may result in non-selection. The criteria were designed to ensure selection of clearly qualified contractors with experience and capability relevant to the anticipated requirements, provide competition, and minimize subjectivity in the Government's assessment.</p>
<p>The PSL will be available for use while other acquisitions are underway for similar requirements. The PSL will be reviewed annually to ensure a legitimate need exists. Presently, the Government anticipates at least four contract actions over approximately the next four years. The PSL will be used as a vehicle to solicit several stand-alone "C" type construction contracts where the high-end of any single contract is not expected to exceed $100M at this time. This, however, does not preclude the Government from soliciting and awarding a contract in excess of this amount if determined to be in the Government's best interest. After the PSL is established, the Government intends to proceed by issuing solicitations using FAR Part 14 procedures (i.e., Invitation for Bid (IFB)). However, the Government reserves the right to issue solicitations using FAR Part 15 (i.e., Contracting by Negotiation (i.e., Best Value using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable up to and potentially including Trade-Off)) when determined to be in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>The SPK projects that are likely to be constructed under stand-alone contracts that will be advertised to the firms on the PSL include cutoff walls using conventional, Deep Mix Method (DMM) / Deep Soil Mixing (DSM) / Cutter Soil Mixing (CSM) / One Pass Trenching (OPT) / or Trench Cutting Re-Mixing Deep Method (TRD) methods and conventional materials including soil bentonite and/or slag cement-cement bentonite. Projects will be located within the Sacramento Valley with a particular focus on levee improvements on the Sacramento and American Rivers.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for procurements offered to firms on the Prequalified Sources list is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Construction, which has a small business size standard of $39.5M.</p>
<p><strong>Bonding Requirements:</strong> Pursuant to the Miller Act, Performance and Payment bonds shall be provided for each project awarded under the PSL. Notice to Proceed (NTP), will not be issued until after the successful bidder or offeror provides sufficient bonding to cover the work required as communicated under the project solicitation.</p>
<p>To be considered qualified for the PSL, firms must meet the following minimum requirements (additional information on required responses is detailed in the attached questionnaire including standards of acceptance):</p>
<p>The Contractor's company, subcontractor, joint venture partner (JVP), or merged company (MC) must have experience in cutoff walls used for seepage control within the last ten (10) years from this announcement. Multiple headings on any one contract must be considered as one construction project experience.</p>
<p>1. Conventional slurry supported cutoff wall construction project experience must include using long-reach excavators or clamshells and include at least two (2) soil bentonite (SB) cutoff walls and two (2) slag cement-cement-bentonite (SCCB) completed cutoff wall projects. For each of the four (4) projects the following cutoff wall standards must have been met to demonstrate sufficient capability:</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of 50 feet deep;<br />&bull; A minimum of 24-inches wide;<br />&bull; A minimum of 500 feet long;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec for SB cutoff walls;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec for SCCB cutoff walls at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements; and<br />&bull; The SCCB cutoff wall must have had a minimum unconfined compressive strength of 50 psi at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements.</p>
<p>2. Deep Mix Method (DMM) cutoff wall construction project experience must include in-situ soil mixing methods classified as: Wet Rotary Shaft (WRS), Wet Rotary End (WRE), Wet Rotary and Jet End (WJE) or Wet Vertical Panel (WVP), as described in the Federal Highway Administration manual Deep Mixing for Embankment and Foundation Support. This experience must also include completed construction of at least two (2) DMM cutoff wall projects including, but not limited to, Deep Soil Mixing (DSM) / Cutter Soil Mixing (CSM) / One Pass Trenching (OPT).</p>
<p>3. Trench Cutting Re-Mixing Deep (TRD) method cutoff walls. This experience must include setting up and operating the batch plant and delivery system to the cutoff wall location, and all associated work with constructing the cutoff wall. For each of the two (2) projects the following cutoff wall standards must have been met to demonstrate sufficient capability:</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of 75 feet deep;<br />&bull; A minimum of 24-inches wide;<br />&bull; A minimum of 500 feet long;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec; and<br />&bull; A minimum unconfined compressive strength of 50 psi at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements.</p>
<p>4. Earth Embankment Construction Project Experience. The Contractor's company, subcontractor, JVP, or MC must have experience in completed construction of at least one (1) project that included placing at least 50,000 cubic yards of engineered fill for flood control levee, earth dam, or earthen embankment for water retention or conveyance, completed in the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>5. Cutoff Wall Construction Project Experience Supporting Data. Example projects provided must include documentation such as contract document excerpts, not to exceed 5 pages, for each project submitted which demonstrate cutoff wall length, width, depth, permeability, and strengths requirements, as appropriate, and laboratory and testing data for cutoff wall permeability and strengths, as appropriate. Additionally, each example project must include a point of contact that may be reached if needed to verify the data.</p>
<p>6. Cutoff Wall Construction Project Experience Submission. Prequalification will be based on the cutoff wall method submitted and approved. This could include one or both of the cutoff wall methods described.</p>
<p>7. Single bonding capability of at least $50M and aggregate bonding capability of at least $200M.</p>
<p>8. Past Performance information that demonstrates satisfactory or above ratings for the projects used to demonstrate previous experience.</p>
<p><em>Certification/statement that all responses to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire are accurate and complete by a principal of the firm.</em></p>
<p><em>An individual's experience gained through employment with previous companies may qualify as the firm's experience provided the individual was substantially involved in the construction of a cutoff wall. Such substantial involvement must be clearly documented in the Capability Statement. For individual-based experience the following additional information must be provided for each individual comprising the firm's experience:<br />&bull; Identify the specific requirement / project.<br />&bull; Identify the scope of the project.<br />&bull; Identify the individual's title and role on the project.<br />&bull; Describe the scope of the individual's labor effort on the project.<br />&bull; Describe how the individual's experience constitutes "substantial involvement."</em></p>
<p><strong>On Ramp Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to utilize an On Ramp concept, to maintain sufficient competition among the PSL by adding additional contractors to the list annually. This will be done by requesting and evaluating capabilities in a manner consistent with this original announcement. The Sacramento District will implement the following opportunity to add additional PSL holders: <br />1. An On Ramp notice will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). The notice shall identify by name, the contractors who have already been added to the list. The notice shall contain the description of the prequalification requirements.<br />2. The potential contractors shall be required to meet the same capabilities established in the original PSL notice for each factor that was established. The evaluation and admission of sources will be on the same basis as the evaluation of capabilities used for the original PSL. <br />3. The announcement of a new On Ramp notice shall be made annually. <br />4. Immediately upon on-ramping, each selected contractor is eligible to bid in response to any solicitation utilizing the specified PSL procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Process:</strong></p>
<p>1. The Government will provide all of the firms on the Prequalified Sources List notification of its intent to advertise a requirement via a Presolicitation Notice. The purpose of this notice is twofold. In addition to signaling the Government's intent to advertise a requirement, this notice will also be used for subcontracting opportunities. The notification will include a brief summary of the requirement, and a request for each firm to provide the Government with a positive or negative statement of interest in proposing on the project. <br />2. The firms will be provided a closing date by which they must respond positively or negatively to their interest in competing on the specific project. In addition to indicating an interest in the project, small businesses on the Prequalified Sources List must also provide proof of sufficient bonding capacity. If the solicitation is issued as a small business set-aside (see para. 3 below), then proof of bonding capacity will have been used to demonstrate that the small business concern can responsibly compete.<br />3. After the specified closing date for receipt of interest, the Government will consider whether the "rule of two" is met per FAR 19.502-2(b) to determine if the project must be set aside for the small businesses on the list. If the "rule of two" is<br />met, then an IFB solicitation will be issued and if proceeding as a small business set-aside, only prequalified small businesses would be eligible for a contract award.<br />4. Per FAR 36.103(a), Contracting Officers shall use sealed bid procedures for a construction contract if the conditions in 6.401(a) apply. Therefore, the Government will consider if:<br />a. Time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;<br />b. The award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;<br />c. It is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding offerors about their bids; and<br />d. There is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid.<br />5. SPK expects that these conditions will be met for most if not all contract actions contemplated for use with the PSL. However, in the event that one of these conditions is not met; or if it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to consider entering into discussions with offerors, then the Government reserves the right to issue Requests for Proposals (RFP) and follow procedures prescribed in FAR Part 15.<br />6. As it is expected that most if not all contemplated projects will proceed as FAR Part 14 acquisitions, the date of bid opening will generally be 30 days after issuance of an IFB.<br />7. The bid results will be made available to all bidders (i.e., those contractors on the PSL that actually submitted a bid - but not those contractors on the PSL that did not bid).<br />8. Upon identification of the apparent-low bid, the bid will be reviewed for conformity to the solicitation requirements (i.e., responsiveness) and contractor responsibility must be considered.<br />9. After an affirmative determination of contractor responsibility is made per FAR<br />9.104. The Government will proceed with contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Defense (DoD) Secure Access File Exchange (SAFE):</strong> Solicitations will be distributed via DoD SAFE to those contractors that indicated a positive interest in the project at hand and intent to bid using DoD SAFE.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Engineer Research and Develop Center (ERDC) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Oceanweather, Inc., 350 Bedford Street, Suite 404, Stamford, CT 06901-1742, to provide wind fields (and where identified pressure and mean monthly ice concentration fields) for the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific and Western Alaska at pre-defined domains, grid and time resolutions for the period 01 January 2018 through 01 January 2019. Along with interpolated ERA5 wind fields for all pre-defined WIS domains for the period 1 Jan 2015 through 1 Jan 2018. The resulting wind, pressure and ice fields will be provided on external hard drives, documentation describing the file format and any evaluation performed on the final meteorological estimates to point-source, marine sites (buoy data). All wind/pressure specifications used in the Wave Information Study (WIS) have all been developed by Oceanweather, Inc. Therefore, Oceanweather, Inc. is the only responsible source capable of providing the wind/pressure inputs. Oceanweather, Inc. has over the past three decades supplied all wind/pressure inputs for the WIS effort and changing contractors would present a significant risk to the Government as the entire wind/pressure archives would have to be regenerated, and the entire WIS re-run. Long-term wave climatology needs to remain consistent and results from another contractor would therefore be of little to no use. The intent of this procurement is to award on a sole source basis under simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Robyn.D.Wells@usace.army.mil no later than 12:00 pm CST on 12 August 2019. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. The NAICS code is 541690 and the business size standard is $15 million.

<DESC>The USACE Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Contracting Office intends to issue a sole source award to C2 Innovations, Inc., 159 Memorial Drive, Unit H, Shrewsbury, MA 01545, to supply the SeaOx autonomous crawler system not later than 30 September 2019. The SeaOx crawler base specs are as follows: 15 in track, 5 x 5 ft footprint; 4 batteries and charger; Xbee radio, SPC electronics, pressure sensor, Ublox, processor; 3-axis FOG, AHRS, Encoder, RTK integration; Silvus MIMO radio with RG buoy; and Time release buoy recovery system. Three day training of the system shall also be provided. <br />This procurement action is exercised as sole source pursuant to authority of FAR 13.5 (a) This subpart authorizes the use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $7 million ($13 million for acquisitions as described in 13.500(c)), including options, if the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the supplies or services sought, and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items. Contracting officers may use any simplified acquisition procedure in this part, subject to any specific dollar limitation applicable to the particular procedure. The purpose of these simplified procedures is to vest contracting officers with additional procedural discretion and flexibility, so that commercial item acquisitions in this dollar range may be solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded in a simplified manner that maximizes efficiency and economy and minimizes burden and administrative costs for both the Government and industry (10 U.S.C.2304(g)) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C.3305, 3306, and chapter 37, Awarding of Contracts. (b) When acquiring commercial items using the procedures in this part, the requirements of part 12 apply subject to the order of precedence provided at 12.102(c). This includes use of the provisions and clauses in subpart 12.3.<br />This Notice of Intent is for information purposes only. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.<br />This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334511 with a Small Business Size Standard of 1,250 employees. All sources eligible to provide the requirement must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide the requirement as outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received within 5 calendar days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining this product through a sole source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Interested parties may submit their capabilities statement for consideration by the Government to Robyn.D.Wells@usace.army.mil.<br />

<DESC>Funding Opportunity Title: Modular, Autonomous, Float Bridge and Raft for Next Generation Tactical Wet Gap Crossing Prototype <br /><br />Announcement Type: Request for Whitepaper (RFWP)<br /><br />Project Announcement Number/Funding Opportunity Number: GSL-19-0001<br /><br />Dates <br />-- Posting Date: 25 Oct 2019 <br />-- Closing Date: 8 Nov 2019 - 1200 PM EST<br /><br />Anticipated Individual Awards: Multiple Awards are anticipated.<br /><br />Types of Instruments that May be Awarded: Firm Fixed Price project level agreement.<br /><br />ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:<br />Participation in this RFWP, and to receive an award under this PA, will require a membership in the SOSSEC Consortium. SOSSEC, Inc. is the Military Engineering Consortium Initiative (MECI) Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement (OTPA) awardee/recipient. Joining the SOSSEC Consortium is a very quick process. New members will be asked to review the Consortium membership agreement and pay a membership fee. The MECI OTPA is an Agreement between the Government (US Army Corps of Engineers-ERDC) and SOSSEC, Inc. SOSSEC, Inc. acts as a mentor and intermediary, supporting companies that bid solutions. For further information about SOSSEC or how to join, please contact Linda Sasser, (603) 458-5529, lsasser@sossecinc.com.<br /><br />NOTE: The below paragraphs are only excerpts from the full Project Announcement. For the full Project Announcement, please contact Linda Sasser, SOSSEC, Inc, (603) 458-5529, lsasser@sossecinc.com.<br /><br />Introduction:<br />This Project Announcement (PA) is a two-step closed project announcement. This announcement is being issued to solicit whitepapers only at this time from SOSSEC Consortium Members. The intent of this notice to promote opportunity to potential vendors. Participation in the forthcoming RFWP is required for potential future Request for Project Proposal (RFPP). Upon receipt of whitepapers, the Government will evaluate through a scientific review process in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria to determine which whitepapers will be selected for potential RFPP.<br /><br />Overview<br />The Government seeks whitepapers for prototyping effort for a system of interacting floating bridge modules with the following prototype subsystems: 1) 3D printing capability for scaled independent floating bridge module hulls 2) docking mechanism to support autonomous assembly in riverine flows up to 6fps 3) inter-bay connection mechanisms capable of supporting scaled MLC60 loads in both multi-bay raft and full-closure (bridge) configurations (Note: connection mechanism may be the same as the docking mechanism or a secondary structural connection) and 4) hardware and software for onboard, programmable navigation of bridge modules supporting both autonomous navigation of individual modules and autonomous organization/self-assembly behavior. (Note: No on-shore coordination system should be required).<br /><br />Background<br />The Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) is envisioned as an autonomous, tracked, armored vehicle with a target MLC of 50. In order to realize the competitive advantage of an autonomous combat vehicle, a fast, reliable, and high-throughput capability is required for wet gaps of moderate to large width. While existing assault and tactical bridge assets can partially fill this role, these systems currently require significant manpower and emplacement time. These requirements do not match the desired mobility of the overall NGCV system, particularly in austere and degraded battlefields.<br /><br />Requirements<br />Autonomous rafting in currents up to 6fps<br />a. A 3D printable hull capability for scale models to allow for rapid prototyping of hull forms and testing in ERDC flumes and basins.<br />b. Computer vision (e.g. onboard lidar/sonar), GPS, and other guidance systems to support remote operation, autonomous navigation, and GPS-based positioning of raft configurations.<br />Autonomous self-assembly and emplacement of full-closure float bridge.<br />a. Docking mechanisms for docking in currents up to 6fps.<br />b. Connection mechanisms capable of supporting MLC 60 tracked vehicles across multiple bays, maintaining acceptable levels of freeboard and deflection from the straight/level configuration. <br />c. Programmable autonomous navigation system supporting both remote and autonomous navigation and self-assembly.<br /><br />The Government intends to award a follow-on sole source production contract to an offeror who provides a successful prototype. The completion of a successful prototype does not guarantee the award of a follow-on production contract.<br /><br />Period of Performance: <br />The total period of performance is estimated to be twenty-four (24) months from effective date of award. Phase 1 is approximately twelve (12) months and Phase 2 is approximately twelve (12) months.<br />Funding: Phase 1 total funding for this PA is approximately $420,000 (including SOSSEC Fee). There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value. Phase 2 funding is TBD.<br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />3909 Halls Ferry Road<br />Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199 <br />United States

<DESC>1. Notice of Intent to Sole Source: W81XWH-19-R-0007<br /><br /><br />2. Sole Source Title: Marshall BioResources - Gottingen Mini Pigs<br /><br /><br />3. Agency: The requesting activity is the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD)<br /><br /><br />4. Contracting Office: U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD<br /><br /><br />5. Location: USAMRICD, Edgewood Campus, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD21010<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />6. Description: The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price supply contract to Marshall Farms Group, Ltd, doing business as Marshall BioResources located at 5800 Lake Bluff Rd (DUNS 049223340; Cage Code 000m2). The statutory authority permitting the acquisition of this requirement by other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 1901. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) citation is 13.501(a)(ii) For a proposed contract exceeding $700,000, but not exceeding $13.5 million.<br /><br /><br />7. Background: The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) has a mission to discover and develop medical products and knowledge solutions against chemical threats with the vision of strengthening our nation and our world by rendering chemical threats medically harmless. USAMRlCD has a requirement to procure a validated strain of swine, Gottingen, for completion of mission-critical research currently being conducted. <br /><br /><br />8. Scope and Purpose: USAMRICD requirement is for a Blanket Purchase Agreement cover 12 month periods for a total of 5 years for the procurement of Gottingen Mini Pigs. In order to maintain ongoing research integrity, the Gottingen Minipigs&reg; strain must be used. Marshall BioResources is the only licensed North American vendor for Gottingen Minipigs&reg; which were developed in Germany. For the past several years Gottingen Minipigs (Marshall BioResources, NY USA) have been utilized in continued research projects at USAMRICD. The Gottingen Minipigs is the smallest Minipig available with limited inbreeding and high quality microbiological genetic background. They are accepted non-rodent models in pharmacology and toxicology. The animals are barrier bred and raised in special state-of-the-art barrier production facilities, and therefore free from any porcine infectious bacteria, viral or parasitic disease. The Gottingen Minipig is specifically bred for research purposes. The Gottingen strain of Minipig has full genetic background available and a large body of background data which can be used for quality control. The many similarities between pigs and humans makes this species an excellent model for disease research and the small size and microbiologically defined health status of the Gottingen makes it a unique swine model for toxicology. The small size is essential to enable animal handling and irradiation, reduce experimental variation due to inhomogeneous exposure to ionizing radiation, and minimize cost for new drug development.<br />Marshall Farms Group is the only known source that can provide the requested Gottingen Minipigs.<br /><br /><br />9. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: The NAICS code for this requirement is 112990, all other Animal Production. <br /><br /><br />10.

CLAUSES:
PROVISION FAR 52.212-1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition. 

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical with delivery as a sub factor and Past Performance. This will be a best value selection. 

1) Technically Acceptable - In order to be technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. 
Sub factor (a) Delivery - Offeror must be able to make the delivery date requested in the RFQ. Delivery date will be no later than January 10, 2020 which is 45 working days from anticipated award date, November 15, 2019. If award date is later than November 15, 2019 then the delivery date will be moved to 45 working days from the date of award. 

2) Past Performance - Please provide information on (3) past purchase orders similar to the scope and size of this requirement. 
The offeror's quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements similar in size, scope and complexity to the requirements identified in the RFQ. The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past projects.  The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An Offeror without relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable).   

The evaluation of Past Performance will reflect the consideration of all relevant agency/customer information that is available to the Government, including both the information received from the offeror's references and information obtained from other sources.

Technical, delivery, and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of provision)

For
Over Micro-Purchase Threshold but Not Exceeding the SAT ($250K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C250-20-AP-0163

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10, Cleveland VA Medical Center.
Network Contracting Office (NCO 10), 3140 Governors Place Blvd, Suite 210, Kettering, Ohio 45409. 2237 No: 541-20-1-250-0012.

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  
The EV1000 is a monitoring platform that displays both intermittent and continuous hemodynamic measurements related to the assessment of the essential components of oxygen delivery as well as the balance of oxygen delivery against consumption. The EV1000 system assists the clinician in assessing the patient s status and supports clinical decisions related to the optimization of oxygen delivery through the management of preload, after load, and contractility. In addition, the EV1000 can assess extra vascular lung water (EVLW) as an indicator of pulmonary edema.

Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used: 
The Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) of the Wade Park campus already has two of these devices. This request is for the purchase of additional units for exact match and continuity purposes at the Wade Park Campus. There is a shortage of these devices in the medical center and in the current situation, the Anesthesiology Service finds itself frequently borrowing these devices from SICU in order to monitor vascular patients during surgery. The Anesthesiology Service is requesting to acquire one of these devices in order to reduce the need to borrow from the SICU. 

Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  
Market research was conducted on GSA, VA NAC, AbilityOne, UNICOR, and VIP. The Vetbiz search using NAICS Code 339112 and keywords  Edwards Lifesciences  revealed one SDVOSB source. The 1st American Medical Distributors (1AMD), Inc., is the exclusive authorized federal distributor of Edwards Lifesciences products and services. 1AMD receives OEM direct prices and are authorized to negotiate on behalf of Edwards Lifesciences. 1AMD is fully trained with Edwards Lifesciences products. Additionally, due to the non-manufacturer rule, the SBA Class Waiver List was reviewed and found that there is no waiver for NAICS Code 339112 and PSC 6515. Based on the NMR and OEM authorized distributor list, the Rule of Two cannot be met. Edward Lifesciences only has one small business distributor.

Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<CONTACT>Thomas M. Pio, Purchasing & Supply Management Specialist, Email thomas.m.pio@usps.gov - Paige Lyne, Puchasing & Supply Management Specialist, Email jacqueline.p.lyne@usps.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a CCTV Upgrades project at the JFK Air Mail Facility located at 250 N. Boundary Rd, Jamaica, NY. 11430-1818. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $750,000 to $1,000,000 with construction completion within 210 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification/Evaluation Package with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must provide a copy of a General Contractors license as required by the State named in this solicitation, or copy of an application to obtain such license(s) to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation. <br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five consecutive years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification. An EMR in excess of 1.0 may be grounds for eliminating a firm from further consideration by the evaluation team.<br />(5) Company must submit information for three comparable security upgrade projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification / Evaluation Package will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2 of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON TUESDAY JULY 9, 2019, AT 11:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME AT THE USPS JFK AIR MAIL FACILITY LOCATED AT 250 N. BOUNDARY ROAD, JAMAICA, NY. 11430-1818 - BUILDING 14, MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Thomas Pio, Thomas.M.Pio@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn .P.Lyne@usps.gov or Robert Ramba, Robert.C.Ramba@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon Eastern Time on July 11, 2019.</p>
<p>Submit proposals via Emptoris, the USPS eSourcing venue. Registration in EMPTORIS is REQUIRED. Registration instructions are attached to this posting. Once you have completed the registration, please email the individuals listed above so an Emptoris invitation can then be sent granting you access to the solicitation and corresponding documents.</p>
<p>The link https:// https://uspsprod.emptoris.com for help with the eSourcing program, please contact the USPS eSourcing at esourcing@usps.gov or call 1-800-332-0317, options 4 and 5.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p><strong>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.</strong> Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p><strong>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.</strong> Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2).<br />If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><strong>Election of Forum.</strong> After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Section I-TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS-make updates to Focus Area 3 as shown below:</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Tactical Network Security/Information Assurance</p>
<p>&#61607;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate ability to securely share multiple forms of information (e.g., voice, video, text, files) among networks of differing classifications and releasabilities. Information exchanges are secured through a combination of data inspection to prevent data spills and propagation of cyber-attacks, data canonicalization to simplify these data inspection techniques, and novel methods to attest the provenance of trusted data in an assured manner.</p>
<p>&#61607;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop a more agile and robust information management capability that spans security domains, allowing for more seamless sharing with our coalition partners. The secure data sharing capability develops technologies to enable both information sharing and data exchange across multiple security domains (e.g. JWICS, SIPRNET, NIPRNET, coalition networks) and also push the state-of-the-possible in object&#8208;level protection at a level commensurate with enforcing mandatory access controls on a single, multi&#8208;level network.</p>
<p>&#61607;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Demonstrate a wide range of information exchange capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, secure, resilient, context-aware, federated and responsive to dynamic mission conditions and management policies. The technologies to support these capabilities include: mission-oriented architectures, Quality of Service policies, publish/subscribe/query mechanisms, semantic characterization, federation, machine learning, opportunistic resource scheduling, peer-to-peer protocols, and open system architectures.</p>
<p>&#61607;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Develop the tools necessary to provide global interoperability without global consensus with integration of DoD systems of both hardware and software using a Systems of Systems approach. New and preexisting technologies should be hosted in a wiki type knowledge base. This includes but not limited to Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Community Cloud. </strong></p>
<p>&#61607;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Research and implement cloud-based hosting to enable information sharing which will allow a wide range of information exchange capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, secure, resilient, context-aware, federated and responsive to dynamic mission conditions and management policies.</strong></p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> 2. Part I and Part II, Section IV.1, update the white paper due dates as follows:</strong></p>
<p>SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:</p>
<p>FY19 by 18 Jan 2019<br /><strong>FY20 by 16 Dec 2019<br /></strong>FY21 by 31 Jul 2020<br />FY22 by 30 Jul 2021<br />FY23 by 29 Jul 2022<br /><br />White papers will be accepted until 3 PM EST on 29 September 2023, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This BAA will close on 29 September 2023</span>.<br /><br />All offerors submitting white papers will receive notification of their evaluation results within 45 days of submission. Offerors should email the TPOC and the Contracting Officer listed in Section VII, for status of their white paper(s) after 45 days, if no such correspondence has been received.</p>
<p><strong>No other changes are made.</strong></p>

<DESC><p>NASA hereby clarifies its search for capabilities/qualifications, as follows:</p>
<p>NASA GSFC/WFF plans to award a contract to Equatorial Launch Australia (ELA) to provide a temporary southern hemisphere launch site for conducting scientific investigations and related services. ELA will be responsible for providing the basic launch range on or by January 2020, support infrastructure, permits and launch approvals while NASA will be responsible for providing and assembling all flight hardware (including the launch vehicle) as well as providing and installing a NASA-owned launcher. The awardee must have a lease for the launch site and demonstrated an ability to obtain agreements with land owners for accessing the payload and rocket landing sites prior to award on or about August 1, 2019.</p>
<p>The base period of performance will be on or about August 1, 2019 - February 29, 2020 and will consist of a planning phase; Option One is March 1, 2020-May 31, 2020 and will consist of the site set up phase and Option Two is June 1, 2020-December 31, 2020 and will consist of the launch support.</p>
<p>NASA/GSFC WFF intends to issue the award on a noncompetitive basis to ELA in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." ELA is the only known source that has a lease in place for the launch site and agreements in work for a landing site that will allow NASA to meet its launch schedule of July 2020.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on June 10, 2019. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html</p>

<DESC><p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is issuing this solicitation for the Consolidated Program Support Services (CPSS) Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)&nbsp;acquisition activity. The CPSS acquisition includes three separate Source Evaluation Boards (SEBs) for the following disciplines:</p>
<p>Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)<br />Project Coordination (PC)<br />Configuration and Data Management (CDM)</p>
<p>This posting includes the&nbsp;Final Request for Proposal (RFP) Amendment P00001&nbsp;for CPSS PP&amp;C.&nbsp;New questions or comments are conditionally permitted, provided they are limited to Amendment P00001 changes/information. Submission of questions or comments in relation to Amendment P00001 shall be submitted via email to the designated point of contact in accordance with Section L, Provision MSFC 52.205-90, <em>Designated Point of Contact.</em></p>
<p>This solicitation is for the CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition which is the follow-on competition for the existing Marshall Integrated Program Support Services (MIPSS) PP&amp;C task order and MIPSS Programmatic Subject Matter Expert (SME) task order.</p>
<p>CPSS PP&amp;C includes PP&amp;C integration, Earned Value Management (EVM), cost estimating, cost analysis, and scheduling. The PP&amp;C integration discipline includes programmatic services supporting managers and decision makers for all aspects of program performance including planning, budgeting, scheduling, cost control, EVM, full cost accounting and budgeting implementation, workforce tracking and analysis, and risk management. The EVM discipline provides support in the area of EVM processes, analyses, and assessments including the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) process per the NASA IBR Handbook, and surveillance and compliance activities per Electronic Industries Alliance EIA-748, Earned Value Management Systems, as well as training of EVM processes and tools. The Cost Estimating and Cost Analysis discipline provides support to program and projects in determining life-cycle costs (LCCs) and provides independent cost assessments of on-going projects. Within the PP&amp;C cost estimating and analysis discipline, support for resource data storage and retrieval library will be required. The Resource Data Storage and Retrieval (REDSTAR) Library is a physical and online storage location for documents containing cost, schedule, technical, and programmatic data on NASA and non-NASA projects, along with studies, cost estimates, and other documents of interest to the NASA cost estimating community. The scheduling discipline provides support in the areas of WBS and schedule development, maintenance, analysis, assessments to include schedule risk assessments, and training.</p>
<p>CPSS SME discipline provides highly qualified experienced SME support to program management including, but not limited to, mentoring, strategic program and project planning and alternatives analysis, program cost and schedule projections, project review, and special studies as requested by the Government.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition is a total small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C contract will provide Mission Service PP&amp;C support for MSFC and Johnson Space Center (JSC); however, it will include an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) component to provide additional PP&amp;C support service and SME support Service to MSFC and any other NASA Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical &amp; Service Support Centers, as identified in subsequent awarded task orders, and at such other locations as may be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. The CPSS PP&amp;C contract period of performance will include a one-year base period and four one-year option periods (to be exercised at the Government's discretion). The Mission Services and IDIQ portions of the contract&nbsp;are anticipated to be firm-fixed-price and the SME IDIQ effort is anticipated to be Time and Materials (T&amp;M). Performance-based deductions will apply to the contract in its entirety.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall possess an active Top Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) by the due date for receipt of proposals. Unpopulated Joint Venture (JV) offerors must have Top Secret FCLs for each member of the JV by the specified due date. Utilizing the CAGE code(s) provided, the Government will verify that the offeror possesses an active FCL using the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency's (DCSA) National Industrial Security System (NISS). No offeror will be considered for award that does not have a Top Secret level FCL in place by the due date for receipt of proposals.</p>

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice does not constitute a request for quote (RFQ).

Introduction: This pre-solicitation notice is to inform potential vendors that VA Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) intends to solicit quotes to provide a Holmium Laser for the Omaha Ambulatory Care Center (ACC) in Omaha, Nebraska.  The Government intends to award one contract for this requirement. Omaha ACC is a new facility currently under construction.  Reference the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for specific project information and requirements.  The SOW and other attached documents are final as posted.  Any changes will be made as necessary via amendments.  All items specified in the SOW shall be BRAND NAME or EQUAL to the brand name.

The solicitation is anticipated to be posted on www.fbo.gov on or about 10/28/2019 for approximately ten business days as a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside.  Solicitation posting and closing dates are subject to change as necessary, and amendments will be issued accordingly. 

Evaluation Factors: The Government will perform evaluations per FAR Part 13.  Partial quotes are not accepted.  The Government will award a contract based on the lowest technically acceptable evaluated price.  Quotes will contain salient characteristics/specifications detailed in the SOW including delivery and warranty information.  Items offered as  equals  of the brand name will be evaluated to verify that the  equal  items meet the salient characteristics identified in the solicitation.  This evaluation will be based on documentation the offeror provides with the quote. 

Delivery: The estimated timeframe for delivery is April-May 2020.  Delivery dates may need to be adjusted to accommodate the construction/facility activation schedule.  The delivery destination can be found in the SOW.

Question Submittal: Potential offerors are encouraged to submit questions regarding the requirement.  The cut-off time for questions are in the solicitation.  All questions must be submitted electronically to Arianne De Los Reyes at arianne.delosreyes@va.gov and Victoria Manigault at victoria.manigault@va.gov before the stated end date specified in the solicitation.  Failure to send questions to both individuals may result in the items not being addressed.  No phone calls will be accepted.  All replies to questions will be posted as an amendment.  

This pre-solicitation notice does not constitute a request for quote (RFQ).
