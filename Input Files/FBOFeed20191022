<DESC>The Department of Energy/Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) has a requirement for Centralized Helicopter Maintenance Services for its fleet of Bell 407 helicopters. The successful contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, facilities, materials, equipment, tools, emergency repairs and supplies necessary to provide Centralized Helicopter Maintenance Services including but not limited to the scheduled major inspections, overhauls, major alterations, major repairs, unscheduled major inspections, scheduled inspections, and annual inspections on WAPAs four Helicopters and their components. This includes the time between overhaul (TBO) inspections and replacement of retirement life items listed under the following type certificates: H2SW and E1GL, with latest revisions.  WAPA operates the following four Bell Helicopter Model 407 aircraft:

Registration #N617DE, Serial #53867 (based at Loveland, CO),
Registration #N618DE, Serial #53798 (based at Bismarck, ND),
Registration #N619DE, Serial #53410 (based at Phoenix, AZ),
Registration #N620DE, Serial #53885 (based at Chico, CA),

The Government intends to acquire commercial items and services using the provisions, clauses, and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, pursuant to the authority provided under FAR Subpart 13.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.

It is anticipated this requirement will be 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 488190 and the size standard is $35.0 million. The Government intends to award to the responsible small business contractor whose quote is determined to be the best value to the Government based upon technical, past performance, and price related factors.

The resulting acquisition vehicle will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a one (1) year base period and up to four (4) option years. The anticipated contract award minimum is $35,000.00 and maximum is $6,500,000.00 over the potential maximum five (5) year ordering period. It is anticipated that orders under the IDIQ contract will be awarded on a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.

In accordance with FAR 5.207, when the solicitation is available, all responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION <br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC), Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC) on behalf of the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM), Clinical Center (CC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate and award a contract without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name) to:</p>
<p>Omixon, Inc<br />One Broadway <br />Cambridge, MA 02142 <br />UNITED STATES</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</p>
<p>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 325413 with a Size Standard 1250.</p>
<p><br />REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2019-05, August 13, 2019. This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures at an amount not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p><br />STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br />1. Title: Omixon / Various Holotype Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) typing kits.</p>
<p>2. Background Information:  The Clinical Center is a clinical research hospital providing medical services for patients participating in human research protocols at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Clinical Center provides patient facilities, services for clinical investigations, research in related areas, and training programs for residents.  <br />The function of the Human Leukocyte Antigen Laboratory (HLA) of the Department of Transfusion Medicine, CC is to (1) provide clinical diagnostic laboratory testing for patients in the Clinical Center to facilitate possible transplant or enrollment into an appropriate protocol for the patient's particular condition; (2) to conduct clinical consultations for Clinical Center physicians in the management of patient care in regards to potential transplant scenarios; (3) to maintain accreditation through various accrediting agencies in order to provide quality results (4) to conduct research in the development of new diagnostic laboratory tests (5) to facilitate the support and development of protocols which involve HLA testing and the implications for patient care.</p>
<p>3. Purpose or Objective: The Omixon Holotype NGS kits provide the highest level of resolution available for HLA tying.  This enables our laboratory to provide the clinicians the most complete information when searching for donors for a hemapoetic stem cell transplant.  The higher the resolution, the better the chance of success for the transplant.</p>
<p>4. Period of performance: 12/1/19 - 11/30/20.  The HLA Lab shall request reagents "as needed basis" by contacting the sales department directly and referencing the PO #.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS (SCOPE OF WORK)</p>
<p><br />Reagent	Estimated quantity<br />SR1124v30 - Holotype HLA Test for 11 genes - QTY.	648<br />SR0124v30 - Holotype HLA Test for 1 gene	- QTY. 192<br />SR0524v30 - Holotype HLA Test for 5 genes	- QTY. 864<br />SR0724v30 - Holotype HLA Test for 7 genes	- QTY. 48</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</p>
<p>This system is on site and has been validated for use on CC patients.  It would be detrimental to the government to attempt to change systems and quite impossible as these instruments are proprietary and only distributed by Omixon, Inc.  With the continuation of using the same system will also help reduces the risk of a disruption in patient care. The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research.</p>
<p><br />CLOSING STATEMENT</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include a technical proposal, a cost-price proposal, the period of performance, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b)(1), the US Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a sole source fixed-priced Purchase Order. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Luminex Corporation, for the xTAG Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (RUO), and the Luminex 100/200 Calibration and Performance Verification Kit. This procurement is recommended to be processed without full and open competition. The GPP kits are being used to measure human exposure to multiple pathogens simultaneously in stool samples from a collaborative study between the US EPA and InterAmerican University in Puerto Rico, and to ensure reproducibility and consistency with ORD CIN's  work .  Therefore, EPA believes Luminex Corporation is the only vendor capable of providing the above referenced lab supplies. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available. Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored. The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please submit response to Cheri Taylor at taylor.cheri@epa.gov or to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Cheri Taylor, US Environmental Protection Agency, One Sabine Island Drive, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561. No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>Project Information: This project will consist of repairing and replacing levee shoreline protection and displaced Riprap in the city of Texas City, Texas. The first of three areas to be worked on for this project is a 1.4 mile stretch, east of the tide gate, of shoreline protection that was displaced due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey. The work in this area will included placement of Riprap material to fill in gaps of the stone protection and provide additional stone across the entire length of the shoreline protection. The second of three areas to be worked on is just west of the tide gate and consist of displaced stone protection and shoreline erosion. For this area, construction will consist of removal of existing stone and fill material along the shoreline followed by replacement of this material with new fill material and riprap. Fill materials in this location will need to be placed according to moisture and compaction specifications. The final area for construction activities is located right in front of the Mosses Lake Tide Gate. In this area, on the northern side of the structure, riprap of the appropriate sizing will be placed in the channel bottom and slopes to increase the armoring protection and fill in any gaps in stone protection. Fill and stone materials removed from these area will need to be disposed of properly offsite following any federal/state laws. In areas where fill material is required, soils needed to complete the final grading will be transported to site from commercial barrow source. The reconstructed levee surface will then be sodded to restore vegetation coverage. Stone needed for the shoreline protection will need to be trucked to site from an offsite staging area.

<DESC>Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice<br />Description:<br />NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the 3D Woven Thermal Protection System products in support of the Mars Sample Return (MSR). This potential procurement is to pursue highly reliable sample return missions that require an Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV) that will use robotic systems and a Mars ascent rocket to collect and send samples of Martian rocks, soils, and atmosphere to Earth for detailed chemical and physical analysis. The EEV will use robust thermal protection system materials with substantial ground and flight test heritage in order to preserve the integrity of the returned samples.
<p>I. PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPISIS/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />This notice has two purposes:<br />1) To request information on capabilities of potential Offerors to provide the services described in the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW).

<p>II. SUMMARY OF PROPOSED WORK</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide research and development in the following requirements in support of the MSR EEV mission:<br />NASA Ames anticipates the fabrication of seven or more, 80-inch wide x 80-inch long panels of one of the following options: <br />1. Weave 1: Single layer 3D layer to layer weave of what NASA refers to as the Insulation Layer (IL).<br />2. Weave 2: A dual-layer Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) 3D layer-to-layer construction, consisting of both the Recession Layer (RL) and IL.<br />III. RESPONSES REGARDING POTENTIAL SOURCES - STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>Interested Offerors having the required specialized capabilities/qualifications to support all of the work described in the Draft SOW are asked to submit a capability/qualification statement of 10 pages or less. There is no required font size and/or type designated for this Capability/Qualification Statement. Figures, exhibits, and diagrams should be readable.

<p>1) Company name, address, CAGE code, DUNS number, and point of contact including phone, e-mail, and website (if applicable).</p>
<p>2) Whether your company is Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a)set-aside Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, HBCU/MI, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business for NAICS code 541715 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences), size standard 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>3) Whether your company plans to participate in this procurement as a Prime or a Sub-offeror.</p>
<p>4) Your company's capability in each of the technical domains. For each technical domain, indicate what percentage of the technical domain you would perform.</p>
<p>5) A list of relevant work performed in the past three (3) years, including contract type, contract number, technical description, dollar amount, period of performance, and a customer reference name and telephone number.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses. A multiple award or single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract may also be considered.</p>
<p>IV. RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH</p>
<p>The Government is soliciting contracting approaches for 3D Woven procurement that will enhance competition and provide business opportunities. Therefore, the Government is requesting feedback in the following areas for consideration during acquisition planning:</p>
<p>1) Socio-economic considerations: ARC is interested in your comments on establishing subcontracting goals for Small Business, 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Small-Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), and Historically Underutilized Zone (HUBZone) Business, such as:</p>
<p>&bull; Are you contemplating proposing as a prime contractor or subcontractor? Why?<br />&bull; What SOW areas are you capable of performing?<br />&bull; Recommendation for other applicable NAICS codes. The NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 541715.</p>
<p>2) Incentives: In an attempt to determine the appropriate contract type (contract types for consideration, alone or in a hybrid combination, including Fixed-Price or Cost-Reimbursement contracts, such as FFP, FPI, FPAF, CPFF, and CPIF) for this particular procurement:</p>
<p>&bull; Which contract type or combination of contract types might be more appropriate (benefits and impediments),<br />&bull; How would that proposed contract type would affect costs and proposal development,<br />&bull; What types of fee, options, and/or other incentives would be appropriate for this requirement, and<br />&bull; How could those incentives be measured/assessed and what data would be needed?</p>
<p>3) Contract Period of Performance: Service contracts are typically limited to a maximum duration<br />of five years unless a deviation is approved.</p>
<p>&bull; Are five years the appropriate duration or would it be in ARC's best interest to seek a deviation for a contract period longer than five years? Why or why not?<br />&bull; Do you have any suggestions or recommendations regarding contract length, inclusive of all options, that would increase small business participation, improve contract performance efficiency, or result in better value to the Government?<br />&bull; Do you have any suggestions for the length of a base period and potential option periods, respectively?</p>
<p>4) Performance measurement: In a mixed-team (Government/Contractor) environment, how could<br />the Government measure factors such as:</p>
<p>&bull; technical/cost/schedule performance,<br />&bull; identifying opportunities for technical and administrative improvement, or cost<br />&bull; risks and risk mitigation,<br />&bull; employee and asset safety and security,<br />&bull; innovative best practices,<br />&bull; quality of service to users, or<br />&bull; responsiveness to changing requirements and budget?</p>
<p>5) Contract Content/Structure:</p>
<p>&bull; Do you have any suggestions or examples of restructuring, simplifications, and clarity in the description of the technical areas of the Draft SOW?<br />&bull; What other information that would improve understanding or clarity of requirements and terms and conditions?</p>
<p>6) Technical Information:</p>
<p>What type of technical information along with the SOW would you like to see with a potential solicitation (e.g., sample tasks)?</p>
<p>There is no limit on the page length to your response to this part.</p>

<DESC>Render Safe Sets Kits and Outfits (RS SKO) Sources Sought
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ) on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Close Combat Systems (OPM-CCS) is issuing this Sources Sought notice as a means of conducting market research to identify potential sources having an interest and industry technologies available to support/provide Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components for use in Render Safe Sets Kits and Outfits (RS SKO).  The result of this market research will contribute to determining potential alternative sources of supply, and the method of procurement, if a requirement materializes. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition, should the Government pursue a contract. Multiple awards may be made. All small business set-aside categories will be considered. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding submissions.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND<br />The RS SKO provides capabilities needed for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams to render safe US and foreign ordnance and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), enabling ground forces commanders to retain freedom of maneuver and secure lines of communications.  The kit equips the team with lowlight visual augmentation system, electronic countermeasures, buried IED detection, dismounted X-Ray imager, X-Ray generator, trace detection of explosives, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear agents, and drugs, unmanned aerial systems, power management, gamma and neutron search and detection, and render safe initiation.  The kit equips the three (3) EOD teams in a platoon.  This requirement is for sources of the components listed below only.  Assembly of the items into the final kit is performed under a separate effort and is not a required capability for this effort.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES<br />The Government estimate requires one hundred and seventy six (176) complete kits.  Additionally, components of the kit are required for EOD Team leaders assigned to advise the Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs) to maintain proficiency.  The capabilities needed include electronic countermeasures, dismounted X-Ray imager, and the X-Ray generator. Kit components and quantities are included in the charts below.  The intent of this Sources Sought is to assess the market and the technology available in surface use explosive ordnance disposal tools and equipment products that could be applied to meet this requirement.

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this RFI is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to it and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">DISCLAIMER:</strong> Reference herein to any specific commercial company, product, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not necessarily constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the United States Government or the Department of the Army (DA). The opinions of the authors expressed herein do not necessarily state or reflect those of the United States Government or the DA, and shall not be used for advertising or product endorsement purposes.</p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">PROPRIETARY INFORMATION:</strong> It is the responsibility of Industry, when providing any comments/responses, to properly mark such information that is considered proprietary or is otherwise restricted. The United States Government (USG) is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Nor is the Government obligated for like data in possession of third parties or for data which is afterwards placed in the public domain by the contractor or by third parties through no fault of the USG. Should the USG need to reproduce the protected data for distribution purposes between Government offices, all such data will be reproduced with restrictive legends in place.</p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none">The USG acknowledges its obligations under the Federal Acquisition Regulation 3.104-4 to protect confidential information provided to the Government (18 U.S.C. &sect;1905). Pursuant to this statute, the USG is willing to accept any trade secrets or proprietary restrictions placed upon qualifying data forwarded in response to this RFI and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following:<br /><br />-Qualifying data must be clearly marked PROPRIETARY and be accompanied by an explanatory text so that the Government is clearly notified as to exactly what data so qualifies.<br /><br />-Mark only data that is truly confidential.<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span><span style="FONT: 7pt "><br />-</span></span></span>Do not mark data that is already in the public domain or is already in possession of the USG or third parties on an unclassified basis.<br /><br />-Proprietary data transmitted electronically must have the PROPRIETARY legend on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail as well as at the beginning of the file. Proprietary information contained within the correspondence shall use the legends: "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<br /><br />Support Contractors: The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>

<DESC>THE INTENT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS TO IDENTIFY CAPABLE INTERESTED BUSINESSES, with the ability to perform the requirements described below.
<p>The scope of work requires the transportation and disposal of RCRA Hazardous wastes, non-RCRA wastes, Compressed Gas Cylinders, State-Regulated waste, Non-Hazardous Waste, and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) located in or around Corpus Christi Texas or within a 50 mile radius of any pick up point listed on this contract. All services necessary for the collection, storage, processing, removal, transportation, final treatment and disposal of waste shall be in accordance with all local, state, Army, Air Force, Department of Defense, Navy, and Federal laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The Class Deviation 2019-O0003 to clause FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting, issued by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) on 03DEC2018, will have a significant impact on set-aside options for this requirement. With Class Deviation 2019-O0003, the Offeror/Contractor agrees to not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Contractors may be subject to a minimum $500,000 fine if awarded a contract with this clause and don't meet the requirement. Based on our extensive history in procuring hazardous waste disposal services, we have identified the majority of RCRA TSDFs (Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities) in the industry as large businesses. Furthermore, all TSDFs used during the performance of this contract must be approved and listed on the Qualified Facilities List (https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Disposal/HazardousWaste/HazWasteDisposal/). Since waste disposal costs make up a large portion of the contract dollar value, there is a reasonable expectation that a small business would pay more than 50% of the cost of the contract to large businesses, given the lack of small business ownership of TSDFs.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit proposals on fbo.gov and award a Firm-Fixed Priced, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Services Contract. The contract is anticipated to have one 30-month base period, followed by one 30-month option period. There is no solicitation available at this time.</p>
<p>IF YOUR FIRM IS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE REQUESTED SERVICES, WITHOUT THE LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING, THE CAPABILITIES PACKAGE DETAILED BELOW IS NOT REQUIRED. In accordance with FAR 6.101(a), with certain limited exceptions, contracting officers shall promote and provide for full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding Government contracts. If your firm would like to respond to this Sources Sought, but has an inability to meet the limitations on subcontracting, please email the POC, without a capabilities package, simply with a Notification of Interest.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms must demonstrate their ability to perform the requested services, described above, by submitting a brief capabilities package (no more than three pages in length, single-spaced, 12-point font minimum). This documentation shall identify, at a minimum: <br />(1) Company name, office location(s), CAGE Code; <br />(2) Relevant experience with industrial cleaning services (ICS) and transportation and disposal (T&amp;D) of hazardous waste within the last five years, including any contract number(s), names of individuals responsible for the referenced contracts/projects, and current telephone numbers for those individuals; if you were a subcontractor, identify the work you actually performed as the sub-contractor; and<br />(3) A statement identifying your firm's ability to perform in accordance with FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (CLASS DEVIATION 2019-O0003). <br />(4) A listing of TSDFs your firm would use during the performance of this contract, identifying each TSDF as similarly situated or not as your firm.</p>
<p>The submittal package must be emailed to raymond.empie@dla.mil the submittal package must be received no later than 1400 EST on XX/Nov/2019. LATE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition is in the Government's best interest. If an unrestricted solicitation is issued, then the Class Deviation 2019-O0003 Limitations on Subcontracting would not apply. All responsible firms, including small businesses, are eligible to submit a proposal in response to an unrestricted solicitation.</p>
<p>A response to this sources sought will not be considered an adequate response to any forthcoming solicitation announcement. The Government WILL NOT provide a debriefing on the results of the survey. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this "sources sought" notice or any follow-up information requests. All information submitted will be held in a confidential manner and will only be used for the purpose intended.</p>

Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Webster Outlying Field (WOLF) Air Traffic Control Division has a requirement to provide Man-Portable (MP) Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) aid systems.
<p>This RFI is issued as part of a procurement strategy for the MPTACAN systems. This RFI description is:</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWCAD) Webster Outlying Field (WOLF) issues this Request For Information (RFI) for market research planning purposes in order to compile technical and operational data for defining a Man-Portable Tactical Navigation Aid (TACAN) system for use by the United States Marine Corps.<br />This Man-Portable TACAN system is to be employed by the Aviation Combat Element of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). A MAGTF is unique within our nation's Joint Force, providing integrated combat capabilities across land, air, sea, and cyberspace domains. MAGTF provides commanders with flexible, lethal, agile, and persistent capabilities to meet a wide spectrum of combat, combat-support, and special purpose requirements. To effectively employ aviation assets, the MAGTF and Joint Force Commander must ensure the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic with reliable and effective Air Traffic Control (ATC). The ability to provide this assured ATC to aircraft is a vital capability of MAGTF and Joint Forces. Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs) must be operational in all climatic conditions, terrain, and the unique geographic locations deployed. NAVAIDs are force enablers that will provide continuous all weather, enroute navigation, non-precision landing approach guidance, and departure ATC services to receiver-equipped friendly aircraft by providing range, bearing, and station identification.</p>
<p>The Man-Portable TACAN will provide enroute navigation information during initial entry tactical landing zone operations and be portable by one Marine. Man-portable is to be defined as capable of being carried by one person. Specifically, the term may be used to qualify: 1. Items designed to be carried as an integral part of individual, crew served, or team equipment of the dismounted Marine in conjunction with assigned duties; 2. In land warfare, equipment which can be carried by one person over long distance without serious degradation of the performance of normal duties.<br />The Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for the Man-Portable TACAN are as follows: <br />Weight (Critical Design KPP)</p>
<p>The Man-Portable TACAN (excluding power source) must be light enough for transport by one Marine; &le; 35 pounds Threshold (T); handheld, &le; 10 pounds Objective (O).</p>
<p>Range (Critical Design KPP)</p>
<p>The Man-Portable TACAN must provide Standard Service Volumes (SSV) Terminal Class (T Class) range an altitude boundaries (T); SSV Low Altitude Class (L Class) range and attitude boundaries (O) In Accordance With (IAW) the U.S. Standard Flight Inspection Manual, FAA Order 8200.1C.</p>
<p>Signal (Critical Design KPP)</p>
<p>NAVAIDs shall comply with MIL-STD 291 Standard Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) Signal and STANAG 5034 TACAN Policy T=O).</p>
<p>Frequency (Critical Design KPP)</p>
<p>The NAVAIDs will require multiple channels within a transmit frequency range of 962 to 1213<br />Megahertz (MHz), receive frequency range of 1025 to 1150 MHz (T=O) IAW MIL-STD 291 Standard Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) Signal</p>
<p>NAWCAD WOLF is interested in vendors who have performed similar efforts on other Government contracts. All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature in a white paper that shall not be longer than 10 pages.<br />Respondents to this RFI should provide a description of their equipment to include the following information:<br />Does a comparable Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) or a Non Developmental Item (NDI) exist that meets these requirements or will Non-Reoccurring Engineering (NRE) be needed? If NRE is needed, estimated time of how long.<br />Radio line of sight capabilities highlighting range (nautical miles) and altitude (feet)<br />Azimuth accuracy, range accuracy, and operating frequency range<br />System input power requirements and power consumption<br />System reliability based on actual usage if available (mean time between failures, mean time to repair should be provided at minimum)</p>

This announcement is to determine interest, availability and capability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned and Small Business concerns for this project. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued on or about May 2020. The project is expected to take approximately 3 to 4 months to complete construction. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.
<p>The Pleasant Point emergency shoreline protection involves constructing a stone revetment along 1,500 linear feet of shoreline, which endures a 20-foot tidal range, located in front of tribal housing and other tribal facilities on the Pleasant Point Reservation. The original revetment was constructed in the 1980s, but has since deteriorated. This project intends to rebuild the structure entirely by placing new 1-ton stones and associated cobble and gravel filter layers in order to protect the shoreline. The work for this project will also include the modification of up to 5 storm-water drains that will extend through the structure. Staging areas will be located on the Pleasant Point Reservation, which is owned by the Passamaquoddy Tribe (project sponsor). The Passamaquoddy Tribe has adopted Tribal Employment Rights Ordinance (TERO)<br />No. 1 at the Pleasant Point Reservation.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (i.e. HUBZone, small business, etc.), as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work components stated above. Please include at least two specific examples of the firm's experience performing the work requirements stated above and indicate whether they were self-performed.

Responses should also include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on stone structures. For subcontracted projects, please include the name(s) and addresses of the subcontractor. The projects must have been performed within the last seven years.</p>

Proof of bonding capability is required. Responses are limited to twenty pages. Responses are due by November 22, 2019.

<DESC>The Bureau of Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of The Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), intends to make award with FactSet Research Systems Inc., 601 Merritt 7, Norwalk, CT 06851-1091, on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for Subscription Services.
<p><br />The Office of Financial Research has a need to obtain data regarding trade credit networks and the associated supply chain in order to deepen understanding of the propagation of financial shocks in credit chains. In particular, trade credit networks between industrial firms may be another channel through which banks may be interconnected. In trade credit networks where firms borrow from each other, temporary shocks to the liquidity of some firms can propagate to where other firms also get into financial difficulty, resulting in large and persistent decline in aggregate activity, as formalized by Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and John Moore (1997, Credit cycles. Journal of Political Economy, 105:211-48). Disruptions in trade credit chains can arise, or existing stress in credit chains can become more severe, if suppliers facing liquidity problems reduce their trade credit to customers or stop offering trade credit to customers in distress even before they actually default. During banking crises, firms that rely on bank finance are likely to be squeezed by credit contractions. This may discourage their suppliers from extending them trade credit, which in turn may reduce their ability to extend trade credit to customers. All but 4 sources of financial relationship data focus on the more material portion of the supply chain relationship such as shipping, distribution channels, reseller agreements etc.</p>
<p>This financial/credit supply chain relationship is found in factoring agreements and credit relationships between suppliers, manufacturers, and wholesalers; all of which have relationships with the banks either through credit lines, direct loans or factoring agreements. The supply chain credit and financing relationships lend themselves best to analysis when looking at entire sectors or the entire economy. This requires bulk downloads of financial and credit information on thousands of firms within in a given sector. Lengthy historical information which covers at least the time period before the recession of 2007 to 2009 is also required in order to perform the necessary longitudinal analysis which examines financial shocks to credit chains. This area of inquiry became even more relevant and urgently required after the exit from the European Union (EU) of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the purchase order is anticipated to be one 12-month base period with two 12-month options.</p>
<p>The total estimated value of this purchase order will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Fiscal Service will consider written responses received no later than 10/31/2019. Responses must be submitted electronically to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, FactSet Research /Attn: BC - EDG. Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows your company is capable of providing the content described in this notice. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no written response is received by the aforementioned deadline that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, Fiscal Service will make award on a sole source basis to FactSet Research Systems Inc. Qualified Contractors must provide the following:</p>
<p>1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HUBZone, etc.). Please ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number, should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.</p>
<p>2. DUNS Number.</p>
<p>3. Specific details of the product(s) that your company offers in regards to this notice.</p>
<p>4. Whether your content is available through a Government contract vehicle or Open Market.</p>
<p>5. A brief capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) that includes a description of your company's standard line of business, as well as a list of customers to whom your company currently provides the specific required content.</p>
<p>The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:</p>

<RESPDATE>102819
<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Acquisition Specialist, Email knwood@fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole source, blanket purchase agreement (BPA) contract with Arc3 Gases, Inc., 1636 US-301, Dunn, NC, 28334 for the purpose establishing a blanket purchase agreement for Laboratory gases. The procurement is being conducted under FAR Parts 12 and 13.
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Laboratory Division has a requirement for gases to support its forensic science operations in the main FBI Laboratory Building and the FBI Operational Response Center. Specialized gases are used to operate scientific instruments and perform examinations in many Laboratory Division disciplines, including Chemistry, Explosives, Trace Evidence, Counterterrorism Forensic Science Research, DNA, Chem-Bio-Rad-Nuclear Sciences, and Firearms &amp; Toolmarks. A single type of gas can be used for multiple functions and a single instrument can use multiple types of gases. Some of those gases include, Acetylene, argon (high pressure, liquid, and ultra-high purity), carbon dioxide (research grade), carbon monoxide (research grade), compressed air, helium (high purity and ultra-high purity), hydrogen (research grad), methane (ultra-high purity), nitrogen (gas, liquid, and ultra-high purity), oxygen and ultra-zero air. Gases must be available for routine delivery on a weekly basis and in the event of an emergency, delivery is required within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Laboratory Division currently utilizes a Perma-Cylinder holding tank for Liquid Argon from Arc3 Gases, Inc. The ability to fill the current tank with up to 1,000 liters of argon is required. Arc3 Gases, Inc. is the only vendor permitted to fill their tanks; therefore they are the only vendor capable of meeting this requirement.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Arc3 Gases, Inc. is the only vendor capable of providing all of the required gases, the number of tanks required and the ability to fill the existing liquid argon tank.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 325120, Industrial Gas Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: Kemper Wood, email address: knwood@fbi.gov by Monday, October 28, 2019 (12:00 pm Eastern). Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Opportunity</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">is offering the opportunity to </span>license its Simrev software tool for commercialization and use.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Background</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Modeling and simulation during product development are costly and slow. Complex systems must be broken down into manageable pieces amenable to engineering analysis by individuals on workstations. An engineer often struggles to make changes to the product that affects parts outside of her domain. The need to distribute the system for analysis, and the subsequent lack of collaboration and communication, increases the cost of non-recurring engineering and introduces delays in time-to-market. Simrev (Simulation Revision) allows the application of software collaboration and design tools to engineering and product development. Enterprise management tools are products for the $375B TAM of software development compared to, e.g. $97B TAM for the Aerospace segment. Simrev is a bridging technology that allows physical products to be managed and designed with development practices from the software sector, including agile.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simrev is a python library imported into a user-generated program. As the program grows in capability and complexity, the engineered product matures. The &ldquo;software twin&rdquo; handles all changes to product configuration and is the portal to running supercomputing analysis and managing workflow for engineering simulation codes. Assemblies become program modules; parts, materials, boundary conditions, and contact interfaces become user defined classes or library-provided objects; and simrev and handles mesh export, input translation, and batch job submission. Simrev has been used to develop models that run in LLNL-developed analysis codes ALE3D, ParaDyn, NIKE3D, and Diablo.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simrev contains patent-pending technology where the version-control state of the software-twin can be mapped one-to-one with the results of the analysis. Simrev has been used on simulation campaigns totaling thousands of commits, processed with thousands of CPU-years, and resulting in hundreds of terabytes of simulated data.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Advantages</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Simrev is a value-added technology for end users who collaborate during product design and development who use advanced engineering simulation codes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The competitive benefits of LLNL&rsquo;s simrev include:</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">&middot;<span style="font: 7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Enabling all engineers to work on the same model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This reduces rework, speeds modeling development time, enables version control, and ultimately reduces the NRE/R&amp;D costs of product development.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">&middot;<span style="font: 7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Easier use of massively parallel computer horsepower for model development and simulations, either internal on high performance computing clusters in a company or available in the cloud. </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">&middot;<span style="font: 7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Allowing for quick turnaround to answer design questions and more resources for &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenario development. Accurate tracking of these &ldquo;bursts&rdquo; of creativity will lead to unexpected innovations in the product development process.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Potential Applications:</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Simrev could be adopted by an OEM supplier of modeling and simulation tools. By providing a new geometry kernel and analysis API to simrev, such tools could replace the current GUI with an &ldquo;Integrated Development Environment&rdquo; (IDE) while building the simulation model. An IDE would allow the transition of existing point-and-click simulation tool users to the software development paradigm. The analysis platform provider would then expand their proprietary model collaboration and revision management tool to a software development model that is compatible with a wide variety of enterprise management tools, unlocking customer value by finally placing modeling and simulation at the core of an enterprise decision making. Additional post-processing tools would then be implemented to close the loop on &ldquo;continuous development,&rdquo; by evaluating a product&rsquo;s physical and market fitness in the same way software is tested for bugs as it is deployed.</p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in; text-indent: -1.5in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development Status:</span></strong>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">Simrev is a functioning prototype that has been used to version control models distributed among working groups of 5-10. Atlassian enterprise management tools are used to plan model revisions, collaborate, and accomplish analysis goals. Simrev has been optimized to run models in LLNL&rsquo;s specialized engineering codes that are not distributed to the public. The first route to commercialization would be for a commercial partner to provide input translation to a commercially available analysis code and adapt simrev for analysis workload management in the cloud. Simrev uses the Cubit python API for meshing and geometry. This tool is commercially available as Trelis. The second route to commercial use is more immediate; a company may establish a business relationship with LLNL and use simrev to develop models for LLNL&rsquo;s codes, on our computational supercomputing platforms, including ALE3D for Industry (ALE3D4I, with GPU acceleration).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Both add a unique value that a commercial partner can offer to their own enterprise or their customers.</p>

<CONTACT>Taylor, Cheri
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b)(1), the US Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a sole source fixed-priced Purchase Order. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Luminex Corporation, for the xTAG Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (RUO), and the Luminex 100/200 Calibration and Performance Verification Kits . This procurement is recommended to be processed without full and open competition. The GPP kits are being used to measure human exposure to multiple pathogens simultaneously in stool samples from a collaborative study between the US EPA and InterAmerican University in Puerto Rico, and to ensure reproducibility and consistency with ORD CIN's  work. Therefore, EPA believes Luminex Corporation is the only vendor capable of providing the above referenced lab supplies. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.   Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored. The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please submit response to Cheri Taylor at taylor.cheri@epa.gov or to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Cheri Taylor, US Environmental Protection Agency, One Sabine Island Drive, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561. No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

WilliamsRDM, Inc. is a woman-owned small business and is selected because of its ability to fulfill the Government's requirement for highly specialized testers. Williams RDM, Inc., is highly specialized because it has the facility, specialized machines, and maintains the proprietary data utilized for the stand alone System Wrap Around Test (SWAT) cable testers.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">WilliamsRDM, Inc. will not provide the proprietary data associated with the SWAT cable testers, for the F-22 program, to other manufacturers. The Government has the rights to the proprietary data, however, the F-22 Program Office has not purchased the delivery of the data. Currently, the F-22 Program Office is working on a separate contract action to procure the delivery of technical data packages.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">Hill AFB, UT, along with the F-22 Program Office, intends to issue a new Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract award for procurement of ten (10) stand-alone SWAT cable testers. Solicitation documents are attached. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">The Stores Management SWAT system is a complex system of cabling that connects hundreds of individual pins from weapons system ports. This enables the software on the aircraft to test the aircraft weapons system signals and functionality. The tester for these cables is a sophisticated device, designed to test fifteen (15) separate cables with unique connectors, signals and pin configurations.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Mr. Dennis Burns, MMESO South Data Analyst, Contractor, Phone 210-536-6074, Email daniel.d.burns8.ctr@mail.mil - Mr. David V. Sheaffer, MMESO South Team Leader, Contractor, Phone 210-536-6075, Email david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Heating Blanket, Air Activated - Hypothermia Prevention. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1905-26_Heating_Blanket_Air_Activated-Hypothermia_Prevention are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Heating Blanket, Air Activated - Hypothermia Prevention products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1905-26_Heating_Blanket_Air_Activated-Hypothermia_Prevention. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 08 December 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MS-1905-26_Heating_Blanket_Air_Activated-Hypothermia_Prevention, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Heating Blanket, Air Activated - Hypothermia Prevention.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Heating Blanket, Air Activated - Hypothermia Prevention. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $1,827,960 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MS-1905-26_Heating_Blanket_Air_Activated-Hypothermia_Prevention who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br /></span>The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1. HEATING BLANKET, AIR ACTIVATED - HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION ACTIVE 4 PANEL / 42,251 /<br />2. HEATING BLANKET, AIR ACTIVATED - HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION ACTIVE 6 PANEL / 16,100 /<br /><br />Vendor may provide any or all of the optional items listed below following the same format as for requirement number 2.<br /><strong><br />Optional Items</strong> /<br />1. HEATING BLANKET, AIR ACTIVATED - HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION ACTIVE 1 PANEL /<br />2. HEATING BLANKET, AIR ACTIVATED - HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION ACTIVE 12 PANEL /<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information</span><br />3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span><br />MMESO South Data Analyst Contractor, Mr. Dennis Burns, 210-536-6074, daniel.d.burns8.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO South Team Leader Contractor, Mr. David Sheaffer, 210-536-6075, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil.

<SUBJECT>NASA Announcement of Opportunity for Third Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-3) Including a Proposal Opportunity for the Discovery Program Focused Mission of Opportunity: MMX Neutron and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer Investigation
<SOLNBR>NNH17ZDA004O
<RESPDATE>062017
<CONTACT>Dr. Thomas Statler, MMX Program Scientist, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, Phone (202) 358-0272, Email thomas.s.statler@nasa.gov - Dr. Jeffrey Newmark, Deputy Associate Administrator for Research, Science Mission Directorate, Phone (202) 358-0684, Email Jeffrey.newmark@nasa.gov
<DESC>On approximately March 22, 2017, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will be releasing the Third Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-3) Announcement of Opportunity (AO). Upon the release date, the full text of the solicitation will be available at NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com/). SALMON-3 is an omnibus NASA Announcement of Opportunity. The SALMON-3 AO provides a solicitation and procurement base for modest investigations, also referred to as Missions of Opportunity (MO), requiring space flight that advance the high priority science, exploration, and technology objectives of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, and the Space Technology Mission Directorate. This initial release of SALMON-3 includes one proposal opportunity for a Discovery Program Focused Mission of Opportunity Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) Neutron and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer Investigation.
<p>Concurrent with the release of SALMON-3, SALMON-2 (NNH12ZDA006O) is closed, and no more appendices will be added to SALMON-2.<br /><br />The SALMON-3 AO describes the common requirements for all MO proposal opportunities, as outlined in the AO body and common Appendices A-H. Subsequent Appendices (called Program Element Appendices, or PEAs) will document specific requirements for each proposal opportunity. At the time of AO release, Appendix I, the MMX Neutron Gamma-Ray Spectrometer Investigation, will be the only such proposal opportunity. Additional proposal opportunities will be added by amendment to the AO. Bookmarks within the document are provided to aid with navigation. Proposers interested in a single proposal opportunity may find the home page for that proposal opportunity by following the links found in the specific Program Elements link under "Solicitations" at NSPIRES. Note that once a specific opportunity has closed, it can be found directly on the "Closed Opportunities" part of the web site. Amendments to the SALMON-3 AO, including those to specific opportunities or the possible addition of new opportunities, may be found by opening "Amendments." The document is kept up to date and incorporates amendments in a clearly identifiable manner.<br /><br />The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Institute of Space and Astronautical Science is developing the MMX mission for launch in 2024. MMX will orbit Mars, visit the martian moons Phobos and Deimos, make close-up remote-sensing and in situ observations of both objects, and return a sample from Phobos. Pending a formal agreement, NASA may participate substantially in the MMX mission, in part through the provision of one science instrument. This solicitation calls for proposals for complete, Principal Investigator led (PI-led) science investigations requiring spaceflight instrument development. When deployed on the MMX mission, this spaceflight instrument will be used to conduct innovative, integrated, hypothesis, or scientific question-driven investigations addressing the mission's science goals.</p>
<p>Participation in SALMON-3 opportunities is, in general, open to all categories of organizations (U.S. and non-U.S.), including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and other Government agencies. However, for PEA I, only U.S. organizations are eligible to propose as the sole or lead organization. Non-U.S. organizations may participate as non-lead organizations collaborating with U.S. leads.</p>
<p>The SALMON-3 solicitation will be open from March 22, 2017, through March 18, 2022. Further information about the solicitation and each PEA will be available on the SALMON-3 Acquisition Page,<br />https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/salmon-3/index.html as it becomes available. A Pre-proposal Conference will be held on April 17, 2017, via Webex; see the MMX PEA additional information page at http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/mmx/ for exact date, time, agenda, and logistical information.</p>
<p>Direct questions specifically regarding PEA-I to: Dr. Thomas Statler, MMX Program Scientist, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546; Tel.: (202) 358-0272; Email: thomas.s.statler@nasa.gov (subject line to read "MMX AO"). Responses to all inquiries will be answered by email and also posted at the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) location of the MMX Program Acquisition website listed above; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.</p>

<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /> <br /> - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br /> - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br /> - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br /> - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br /> - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br /> - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong></div>
<strong>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></div>
</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.</p>
<p>Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The closest military facility is NAS JRB in Belle Chasse, located approximately 62 miles from MSU Houma. Since it takes about 87 minutes to arrive to NAS JRB, it is not feasible for MSU personnel to use the gym at any point during the workday without taking in excess of 174 minutes away from work. Therefore, gym memberships at a local commercial gym are required in order for MSU personnel to be able to abide by the Commandant's Mandatory Workout Policy. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a<br />contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic<br />Funds Transfer - System for Award Management, which indicates "All payments by the Government under this<br />contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)." Those not currently registered can obtain registration by<br />going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after<br />submission. Contractors will need to obtain a unique entity identifier for processing their registration. Refer to<br />www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.<br />Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be<br />selected.<br />ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration<br />will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the<br />notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update<br />W912QR20Q0001<br />Page 4 of 46<br />data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk<br />(FSD) will activate the entity's registration.<br />Effective June 29, 2018 vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to<br />the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the<br />GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM.<br />Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier<br />(known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to<br />begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no<br />cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors<br />should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).<br />PLEASE NOTE: SAM is completely free of charge for both registrants and</p>

Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 
Synopsis: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation/ 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE  
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for M&S Technologies, Inc. ® or equal Digital Visual Acuity System-LCD commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Solicitation number 36C10G19Q0145 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2009-06 dated October 10, 2019.
Requirement Description:
In order to ensure we are able to continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
The VA has a requirement to purchase M&S Technologies, Inc. ® or equal Digital Visual Acuity System-LCD and related equipment to deliver patient care at its VA medical facilities throughout the United States, U.S. Territories, Guam, and the Philippines.  M&S Technologies, Inc. ® or equal Digital Visual Acuity System-LCD Visual acuity testing systems are based on having the patient view a chart of optotypes, colors or patterns. A standard part of most exam lanes, visual acuity tests can take a number of forms. At their simplest, these tests can be preprinted cards or charts that can be hung or projected on a wall. However, newer digital visual acuity testing systems are built around computer monitors which allow the system to feature a large number of vision tests that can be accessed via remote control and set up for direct or mirrored viewing. Whether evaluating a new patient or conducting a post-op assessment, a visual acuity testing system can be an important part of a practice.
A Firm-Fixed-Price Requirements contract will be awarded in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications and schedule of this solicitation herein. Quotes shall contain the vendor s best terms for cost/price and technical capabilities of the M&S Technologies, Inc. ® or equal Digital Visual Acuity System-LCD and related equipment. The government reserves the right to award without discussions.  
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112   Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing, Product Service Code: 6515   Medical and Surgical Instruments, Equipment, and Supplies. The associated size standard is 1000 employees.  This procurement action set-aside 100% for Small Business concerns.  

This procurement is in accordance with FAR clause 52.211-6,  Brand Name or Equal  which requires that the vendor indicate each product that is being offered as an  equal  product. In accordance with FAR Part 13.106-2, the Government will perform an evaluation in an impartial manner using a comparative analysis of the quotes received. The Government intends to compare quotes to one another to select the product that is best suited to fulfill the requirement for M&S Technologies, Inc. ® or equal Digital Visual Acuity System-LCD BNOE and related equipment as identified in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  

The VA is looking to establish a one-year contract with two 12-month option periods. All interested vendors shall provide a quote for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule which includes the option years.  Delivery is FOB destination and requires delivery to VA medical facilities throughout the United States, U.S. Territories, Guam, and the Philippines.  Firm-Fixed-Price Orders will be placed against this contract in writing and will provide the exact delivery locations, delivery dates and exact quantities. 

The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition including attached addenda to the provision.

<DESC>On March 22, 2017, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released the Third Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-3) Announcement of Opportunity, and the full text of the solicitation became available on the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/. SALMON-3 is an omnibus NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO).
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The SALMON-3 AO provides a solicitation and procurement base (the common AO body) for modest investigations, also referred to as Missions of Opportunity (MO), requiring space flight that advance the high priority science, exploration, and technology objectives of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, and the Space Technology Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>The SALMON-3 AO describes the common requirements for all MO proposal opportunities, as outlined in the AO body and common Appendices A through H. Subsequent appendices called Program Element Appendices, or PEAs, document specific requirements for each proposal opportunity.&nbsp; At the time of this AO's release, Appendix I, the MMX Neutron Gamma-Ray Spectrometer Investigation, was the only proposal opportunity. Subsequently, additional proposal opportunities, PEAs J through O, have been added.&nbsp; A PEA-specific FBO notice highlights an opportunity to propose when NASA amends SALMON-3 to add a new or to revise an existing PEA.</p>
<p>This FBO notice announces that NSPIRES will post an amendment to SALMON-3's common AO body on or after October 22, 2019.&nbsp; Prior to the issuance of this amendment, NASA released PEAs I through O as amendments to the SALMON-3 AO; therefore, this amendment does not change PEAs I through O.&nbsp; PEAs released after the date of this amendment are subject to these changes unless specified otherwise in the PEA.</p>
<p>This FBO notice is not a complete or verbatim summary of the changes included in Amendment 17 to the common body of SALMON-3; therefore, it is necessary to visit NSPIRES and download the full version of the common AO body.</p>
<p>NASA is modifying SALMON-3 to make several changes to better align the common AO body to version 5.0 of the Standard Principal Investigator (PI)-led Mission AO Template found at <strong>https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/sao_templates.html</strong>.&nbsp; The amendment's changes range from simple updates, e.g., a new point of contact for SALMON-3's common AO body, to complex matters related to requirements, sections, and common appendices that the PEAs share.&nbsp; For example, for future PEAs that use the Two-Step evaluation process, several requirements are deferred to Step Two.&nbsp; For PEAs with a Single or One-Step evaluation process, deferrals are not possible.</p>
<p>Other changes include:</p>
<p>1.	Some NASA documents referenced in SALMON-3 have newer versions and the newer document references replace the older versions.</p>
<p>2.	Appendix H adds a note acknowledging that in December 2020 the Duns and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System will no longer be the official identifier (ID) for doing business with the U.S. Government and references the source-for-more information URL: gsa.gov/entityid.</p>
<p>Participation in SALMON-3 opportunities is, in general, open to all categories of organizations (U.S. and non-U.S.), including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and other Government agencies.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is necessary to visit NSPIRES and download the full text of the common AO body for the details of the types of limitations that NASA may place on a specific, contracted evaluation, assessment, or support organization.&nbsp; This FBO notice summarizes two types of limitation as:</p>
<p>1.	Full Limitation: NASA precludes a support organization from participating in any capacity in support of a respondent under this AO.</p>
<p>2.	Partial Limitation: Under appropriate circumstances and conditions that are specified in the SALMON-3 AO common body, or in a specific PEA, NASA permits respondents to contract with a NASA support organization for certain services.</p>
<p>The SALMON-3 common AO body lists the names of two NASA-contracted evaluation-support organizations, Cornell Technical Services (CTS) and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) and its subsidiaries and affiliates.&nbsp; Participation by these two organizations is subject to full limitation in proposed investigations as described in detail in the common AO body.  SALMON-3 also lists an independent program assessment organization, Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace).&nbsp; Aerospace's participation may or may not be subject to a full or a partial limitation.</p>
<p>Sometimes individual PEAs place other restrictions or limitations on categories of organizations, such as limiting non-U.S. organizations to collaborating only with a U.S. Lead.</p>
<p>The SALMON-3 solicitation is open from March 22, 2017, through March 18, 2022. Lapses in Government funding may impact some dates specified in the SALMON-3 AO, including some PEAs.&nbsp; In the event of future lapses to the NASA operations, proposers should visit NSPIRES, the official NASA source for the full SALMON-3, including all of its PEAs.&nbsp; NASA reserves the right not to make any additional awards or cancel this AO at any time.&nbsp; Address questions or comments concerning the SALMON-3 common AO body via E-mail to Dr. Michael H. New, Deputy Associate Administrator for Research, Science Mission Directorate, NASA HQ, Washington, DC 20546; E-mail: <strong>Michael.H.New@nasa.gov</strong>.&nbsp; In the subject line of such emails, please type "SALMON-3 Common AO Body."</p>
<p>Responses to inquiries will be given by E-mail and when appropriate posted to the SALMON-3 AO Questions and Answers, (QAs) located at <strong>https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/salmon-3/S3QAs.html</strong>.&nbsp; Anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.</p>

<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 11/01/2019 to 12/31/2019</p>

You are required to create a user account to register and/or update your entity records (i.e., Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, DUNs number, etc.) in SAM which were previously located in separate CCR and ORCA websites.  This information is necessary in order to receive award consideration.  All questions concerning this notice should be submitted electronically via email to the Points of Contact as indicated in this announcement.  All information pertaining to this announcement, including technical (or other) questions and answers will be provided to/through the Contracting Officer/Contract Administrator ONLY to ensure equal distribution of information to interested parties via Federal Business Opportunities (FebBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov.</p>

Developed technologies should function in austere environments to extend long-term missions by engaging single-use wastes and scavenged materials as feedstock, consequently decreasing the logistic burdens and risks associated with delivery of supplies.

<DESC>The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is to make strategic, early investments in science and technology that will have long-term positive impact on our nation’s national security. As part of this mission, DARPA makes high-risk, high-reward investments in science and technology that have the potential to disrupt current understanding and/or approaches. The pace of discovery in both science and technology is accelerating worldwide, resulting in new fields of study and the identification of scientific areas ripe for disruption. While DARPA’s existing investment strategy continues to yield success, in order to capitalize on these new opportunities, its approach to investing must include faster responses with more small, targeted investments. This new approach is called Disruptioneering. Disruptioneering will enable DARPA to initiate a new investment in less than 90 days from idea inception.

<p>Title:<br />Laboratory Developed Testing</p>
<p>Description(s):<br />Request for Information</p>
<p>Title: Laboratory Developed Testing<br />Introduction:</p>
<p>1. This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that a solicitation will be issued. This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation For Bid (IFB).</p>
<p>2. Please note that the collection of this requested information does not obligate the U.S. Government to incorporate any solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to procure services. Proprietary information should not be included in the RFI response. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is not liable to pay any costs associated with companies responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>3. All information received resulting from this RFI will be used by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) for acquisition planning and market research purposes only. However, your response may be releasable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). If you wish the DHA to consider any portion of your response as "confidential commercial information", you should clearly mark the portion as "confidential commercial information".</p>
<p>4. The Defense Health Agency (DHA), at its discretion, may request respondents to this RFI to elaborate on information in their written response. Respondents to this RFI will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided.</p>
<p>5. The DHA invites all interested parties to submit a written response to this Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is issued for the sole purpose of conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.</p>
<p>Background<br />The DHA is the DoD organization responsible for managing the TRICARE health care benefits. This includes integrating state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. Under DHA, the Enterprise Support Activities initiative was established with the goal to consolidate resources, standardization, and reengineer processes. These are essential elements in order to improve performance, decrease costs, and enable the Military Health System (MHS) to operate more efficiently as an integrated health system. As part of this goal, DHA is seeking information from industry to assist in the implementation and deployment of a comprehensive and commercially available Laboratory Developed Test Solution for the Military Health System (MHS). The Center for Laboratory Medicine Services office ensures regulatory compliance across the MHS Laboratories. They also advise, evaluate, establish policy involving laboratory standards and approve laboratory developed tests.</p>
<p>The Defense Health Agency's Clinical Laboratory Medicine Services will hold an Industry Day on December 4, 2019. This will be a virtual meeting. The purpose of Industry Day is to gather information from vendors that perform Laboratory Developed Testing (LDT). Tests presented during this event may be included in the battery of tests being evaluated during the next Defense Health Agency's Laboratory Joint Working Group.</p>
<p>Information Submission Instructions:<br />There will be 10 presentations and each presenter will have 40 minutes. The 40 minutes includes 5 minutes for preparation, 25 minutes for presentations, and 10 minutes for panel questions. Each individual vendor will be allocated one 40 minute time slot. A vendor may register for only one time slot. Time slots will be organized by similar test types. Registration will be available to the first 10 vendors. Additional industry days will be added to allow all vendors who register a chance to present their LDT. <br />Vendors should submit a summary of their submission in the format provided (see attachment) no later than (NLT) COB November 22, 2019. A summary should accompany each test presented. Vendors may submit a directory of laboratory tests their laboratory performs. All submissions and presentation information should be submitted to: Linda.M.Walker38.civ@mail.mil and Tatanya.L.Cooper.mil@mail.mil. Registration requests/and or questions concerning this event should also be directed to Tatanya Cooper, Tatanya.L.Cooper.mil@mail.mil or at: 703-681-7317.</p>

<p>Includes existing items within the production/commercialization phase (i.e. after design or development, and before widespread government adoption) as well as adaptations of existing commercial products.</p>
<p>The CSO solicitation process will include a multi-phased solicitation and evaluation approach: Phase 1 - Submission of the Written Solution Brief, Phase 2 - Oral Presentation (if applicable), and Phase 3- Request for Proposal. The CSO is considered a competitive process, intended to ensure that competitive procedures are used to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>Interested parties are highly encouraged to visit the GSA FEDSIM website<br />https://fedsim.gsa.gov/CSOsolutions.html to obtain more information regarding the CSO process and new opportunities. Specific projects and technical areas of interest will be posted via an open solicitation on the GSA FEDSIM website and may be updated at any time.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are hereby advised of the following:<br />Solicitation for solution briefs is not a guarantee that award and obligation of funds will be made.</p>

<a href="mailto:katherine.fogle@faa.gov">Click here to email Kahterine Fogle</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will conduct an industry day at FAA offices in Atlanta, GA, Fort Worth, TX and Seattle, WA on November 19, 2019 to welcome qualified vendors capable of providing all personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supervision for a broad range construction services. 

The purpose of industry day is to address the following: 

1. Provide program overviews and preliminary requirements. 
2. Vendor one-on-ones will have the opportunity to meet with FAA representatives to present their company information and provide feedback on the preliminary requirements. 
3. Gage the ability of the marketplace to provide regional and nationwide construction services.
4. Gage the interest of capable vendors that fall into the following categories: large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms that can provide a wide range of construction services. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses and other market research is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The FAA is considering issuance of a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to support the following two programs, but not all inclusive:

a. EnRoute Facilities Planning and Modernization Program supports EnRoute Air Traffic operations and service level availability through facility life cycle program management of the 21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), the Combined EnRoute Radar Approach Control Facilities (CERAPs) at San Juan and Guam and other FAA owned, operated, or sponsored facilities.

b. Terminal Facilities Office Planning and Execution Program supports the construction of new and replacement of Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities within the National Airspace System (NAS), and Surveillance, Weather & Radar facilities in addition to the modernization, sustainment, repair, maintenance and upgrading of these facilities throughout their lifecycles.  

Background: The mission of the FAA Terminal Facilities Planning and Execution Team and EnRoute Facilities Planning and Modernization Team is to modernize and sustain the air traffic control and radar approach facilities that comprise almost 400 million gross square feet. Many facilities in the NAS operate 24-hours per day and provide services critical to safety. The continued operation of all equipment in the NAS and the safety of life and property are paramount considerations in all work conducted under this contract.

BOA Scope of Work: Vendors shall furnish all personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supervision to accomplish a broad range construction services including, but not limited to design, design-build, build, new construction, repair, alteration, demolition, site work, excavation, cast-in-place concrete, masonry, structural steel, electrical, mechanical (including HVAC), painting, carpentry, roofing, millwork, road repair, and other specialty and general construction. All work will be ordered by the Contracting Officer using BOA Call Orders. Call Orders will identify the scope of work, schedule, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.

The FAA anticipates issuing BOAs for the following thresholds: 

1. SMALL BOA - REGIONAL 
• Projects ranging from $10K-$500K
• Regional Service Areas (Eastern, Central, Western)
• 3 vendors per Service Area

2. MEDIUM BOA - REGIONAL
• Projects ranging from $500K-$2M
• Regional Service Areas (Eastern, Central, Western)
• 3 vendors per Service Area

3. LARGE BOA - NATIONWIDE
• Projects ranging from $2M and greater
• 3 vendors 

The FAA requires prior FAA experience for some, but not all projects. The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The business size standard for this NAICS is $39.5 million.

**No telephone requests or questions will be accepted.** All requests to attend an industry day must be emailed to Katie Fogle @ Katherine.fogle@faa.gov no later than 17:00 MT on November 12, 2019. Please include the announcement number, title and location in the email subject line.

<DESC>This sources sought seeks technical capabilities and innovative ideas from industry that addresses the technical objectives and development of a Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) IV sensorcraft (i.e., a highly integrated instrument and small spacecraft).<br />
<p>BACKGROUND<br /><br />SAGE IV intends to take advantage of advancements in small satellite technologies to demonstrate the ability to match or exceed the measurements of the SAGE III payload (1.15 m3 volume, 329 kg mass, currently operating on ISS) in a 6U CubeSat form factor. Beyond this demonstration, the eventual goal is to deploy a constellation of four or more SAGE IV CubeSats for continuous monitoring of atmospheric aerosols, ozone, and other important constituents, and extensibility of the SAGE IV measurement concept to other planetary atmospheres will also be explored.</p>
<p>Earth Venture is a program element within the Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP) program consisting of a series of innovative, integrated, science-driven approaches to pressing Earth system science issues. The goal of NASA's Earth Venture mission portfolio is to provide frequent flight opportunities for high-quality, high-value, focused Earth science investigations that can be accomplished under a not-to-exceed cost cap and that can be developed and flown relatively quickly, generally in 4-5 years or less. For additional information on the Venture Class program, visit the ESSP website at https://essp.nasa.gov/.</p>
<p>The SAGE IV concept is expected to be classified as a "Class D" small satellite mission.</p>
<p>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking to lead in developing a proposal addressing the goals and objectives of Earth Venture, specifically focusing on the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) IV concept. This sources sought is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. Government Agencies. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other Minority Universities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses, and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply. Participation by non-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASA's policy of no exchange of funds, in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The technology focus of this sources sought is to finalize the current LaRC design and the subsequent assembly, integration, and testing (AI&amp;T) necessary to implement a constellation of low-cost, Low Earth Orbit, atmospheric occultation sensorcraft that meet or exceed the retrieval capabilities of SAGE II. The goal of this effort is to sustainably meet NASA's ongoing mandate to monitor ozone in the atmosphere and to provide data continuity for critical stratospheric aerosol measurements while simultaneously advancing the state of the art, overcoming the geographic sampling limitations of the SAGE series of heritage instruments, and preserving the continuity of the SAGE data products. This requires observing the solar disk during sunrise and sunset occultation events in spectral channels that range between the ultraviolet and infrared. A SAGE IV Pathfinder ground demonstration prototype was developed during a NASA-funded Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) effort. The IIP developed a flight concept and demonstrated a design that would satisfy requirements for a flight mission given certain performance requirements on flight detector and electronics as well as the spacecraft bus itself. As such, this sources sought primarily seeks out vendors that can provide the detector, the spacecraft bus, and/or AI&amp;T services both for the instrument into the spacecraft as well as AI&amp;T for the instrument itself.</p>
<p>NASA LaRC is seeking input from industry and industry teams that have experience in the capabilities outlined below:</p>
<p>A) Deliver Focal Plane Detector: The SAGE IV instrument will require a COTS space flight quality 2D PIN diode array with square pixels that should not exceed 35 &micro;m pitch, active area no smaller than 4 mm &times; 4 mm, and total focal plane assembly package size (excluding external focal plane electronics or harnessing but including hybridized control and data acquisition circuits such as an analog or digital readout integrated circuit) not greater than 50 mm &times; 48 mm &times; 20 mm. Additionally, the project seeks full potential well density &ge; 5000 electrons/&micro;m2, spectral sensitivity between ~350 nm and ~1050 nm (i.e., silicon responsivity spectrum), programmable integration time enabling time stepping between at least ~0.5 ms and ~20 ms, at least 12-bit readout electronics, and full frame readout rate of at least 20 Hz. Active temperature control being necessary for SAGE IV focal plane array temperature stability (desired stable to about &plusmn; 0.1 &deg;C at about 10 &deg;C in Low Earth Orbit), the project will require either an integrated (non-cryo cooled) active thermal control system or available surface area on the back side of the focal plane assembly for government bonding of a government-supplied thermoelectric cooler system. The typical detector element should be linear to at least 1% ideally between 1% and 85% of full well capacity, have dark current ideally at or below 0.5% of full well capacity at 10 &deg;C and 10 ms integration time, and exhibit read noise ideally at or below 0.02% of full well capacity. Vendors responding to this space flight detector capability shall also specify expected pixel yield per unit and first time yield (FTY) per run statistics, manufacturing process (e.g., flip chip bump bonding, polymer adhesive, or direct bonding), details of available development focal plane electronics, details of readout windowing capabilities, power dissipation, and expected figures of merit for both the detector (including but not limited to well capacity, relative spectral response, quantum efficiency, readout noise, detector flat field response, noise-equivalent power, and mean linearity and adjacent crosstalk percentage/MTF) and ROIC (including but not limited to integration efficiency, system gain, fixed pattern noise potential, quantization step equivalents, effective number of bits, and bit error rate, as applicable). ROM costing and schedule for delivery of 5, 10, or 20 space flight ready focal plane assemblies, end-item data packages including electrical and mechanical interface documents, drawings, and vendor test reports supporting performance requirements, and as applicable external focal plane electronics and harnessing shall be provided by vendors responding to this capability.<br />B) Deliver Spacecraft Buses: The SAGE IV project will require space flight quality CubeSat or small satellite spacecraft buses including structures and trusses for a likely 6U form factor (12U backup options also welcome) equipped with a solar panel electrical power system with &gt;75 W power available to the instrument and absolute attitude and determination control system (ADCS) that enables &lt; 5 arcminute absolute pointing accuracy. The bus must support at least 4U of government provided payload configured to the CubeSat form factor. The bus must accept real-time ADCS attitude commanding from the internal science payload (as its imager centroids its radiometric target) and be capable of a slew rate with respect to inertial space of 1.5&deg;/sec for an ideally 6 kg total package. The bus should provide GPS time, GPS PPS, and GPS ephemeris to the internal science payload, offer command and data handling systems including onboard data storage and downlink (aggregate data volume of ~1 Gigabytes per day), and enable timely transmission of health and status of the instrument and spacecraft (e.g., Global Star). The respondent should have the capability for AI&amp;T of a completed flight instrument into the spacecraft bus, have capability for orbit thermal modeling to design mission critical thermal control surfaces, have the ability to process space flight hardware and cite a contamination control plan, and be able to provide mission operations support. ROM costing and schedule provided should include all itemized AI&amp;T services offered as well as the delivery of a bus simulator engineering development unit early in the project cycle, delivery of 1, 2, or 4 space flight ready spacecraft buses, all offered end-item data packages including electrical and mechanical interface documents, drawings and schematics, and vendor test reports supporting performance requirements.<br />C) Instrument Design and AI&amp;T: The SAGE IV project is seeking respondents with the ability to provide engineering design and AI&amp;T services. The respondent should have the ability to work closely with NASA and other vendors to provide support in mechanical, structural, electrical, thermal, systems, and/or optical engineering to mature the laboratory SAGE IV Pathfinder design to a spaceflight ready instrument. The respondent should indicate any capacity to work closely with NASA and other vendors to support subsequent subsystem, system, and spacecraft level AI&amp;T, including environmental testing and spacecraft maneuver and conops testing.</p>
<p>Hardware should be a higher Technology Readiness Level (TRL) that is essentially "spaceflight ready." Earth Venture requires demonstration of TRL 6 by the Preliminary Design Review, where TRL 6 is roughly defined by a "system/subsystem model or prototyping demonstration in a relevant end-to-end environment (ground or space)." Since this is intended for a small spacecraft with a limited form factor (e.g., a 6U or 12U CubeSat), minimization of volume needs to be considered. AI&amp;T services should have a demonstrated history of success working with spaceflight missions.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to submit a capabilities statement detailing the ability to meet the requirements listed below.</p>
<p>1) Technical Capability: This criterion assesses the technical capabilities required for the performance of the development activity described herein with emphasis on the instrument components listed and sensorcraft AI&amp;T. Assessment will be made of the respondent's technical capability to build or complete similar spaceflight hardware or tasks, including but not limited to: (a) the respondent's ability to develop successful plans for meeting defined instrument and testing requirements, (b) the ability to deliver space flight hardware, and (c) the availability of key personnel skilled in similar space hardware and tasks. <br />2) Payload Accommodation: This criterion assesses the understanding of accommodating optical payloads. [Applicable to (B) and (C) only].<br />3) Facilities: This criterion assesses the respondent's facilities (e.g., clean room, fabrication, benchtop development, small spacecraft mass moments and attitude determination and control testing, and environmental and optical testing facilities, as well as mission/quality assurance and analysis/modeling capabilities as applicable). <br />4) Cost and Schedule Control: This criterion assesses the cost and schedule estimate for the space technology solution being offered. The cost and schedule management strategies for hardware development and delivery should be discussed, as applicable. Provide the cost and schedule drivers and assumptions, as applicable.

<DESC>Project Information: This project will consist of repairing and replacing levee shoreline protection and displaced Riprap in the city of Texas City, Texas. The first of three areas to be worked on for this project is a 1.4 mile stretch, east of the tide gate, of shoreline protection that was displaced due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey. The work in this area will included placement of Riprap material to fill in gaps of the stone protection and provide additional stone across the entire length of the shoreline protection. The second of three areas to be worked on is just west of the tide gate and consist of displaced stone protection and shoreline erosion. For this area, construction will consist of removal of existing stone and fill material along the shoreline followed by replacement of this material with new fill material and riprap. Fill materials in this location will need to be placed according to moisture and compaction specifications. The final area for construction activities is located right in front of the Mosses Lake Tide Gate. In this area, on the northern side of the structure, riprap of the appropriate sizing will be placed in the channel bottom and slopes to increase the armoring protection and fill in any gaps in stone protection. Fill and stone materials removed from these area will need to be disposed of properly offsite following any federal/state laws. In areas where fill material is required, soils needed to complete the final grading will be transported to site from commercial barrow source. The reconstructed levee surface will then be sodded to restore vegetation coverage. Stone needed for the shoreline protection will need to be trucked to site from an offsite staging area.

San Diego, CA 92108-3586
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Contracts Department, Orlando, FL announces its  procurement, on a sole source basis, technical services from Innovasystems International, LLC (Innova), 2385 Northside Dr Ste 300, San Diego, CA 92108-3586, for P-8A SHARP LMS 7.0 Installation on various Training System Support Centers  and Networks for the P-8A Poseidon Training Devices located at NAS Jacksonville, FL; TX; NAS Whidbey Island, WA; Boeing Dallas, Boeing St. Louis, MO, and Royal Australian Air Force Base, Edinburgh. These sites will all have SHARP LMS 7.0 installed without impacting usage and performance of their existing instances of SHARP LMS. Innova will also provide training on the deltas between SHARP LMS v 5.2 and SHARP LMS v 7.0 and assist with the transfer of courseware and syllabi from existing SHARP LMS v 5.2 servers to new SHARP LMV v 7.0 servers.
   

This requirement was procured in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under Title 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”.  As the current support contractor, Innova possesses the exclusive technical expertise and in-depth knowledge that is required in understanding and furnishing these services. Only Innova has the knowledge of the current state of SHARP LMS software code that is currently being utilized to permit the software to integrate seamlessly between the AAS and P-8A systems. Innova is the current provider for support to the P-8A training system for managing SHARP LMS.
Due to the critical time line to meet IOC, Innova is the only vendor positioned to supply their vast knowledge and experience with the SHARP code to prevent delays that would jeopardize the SHARP LMS v 7.0 update to the AAS and P-8A training systems.
