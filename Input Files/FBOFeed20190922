<CONTACT>Taylor, Cheri
<DESC>The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Qiagen, LLC, for an Annual Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) Software License with options over 5 years. This procurement is recommended to be processed without full and open competition. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Software is a web-based application that enables NHEERL's researchers to explore, understand, and discover relevant networks significant to their research results. Using a researchers gene or protein dataset in combination with Ingenuity's genome-scale knowledge base, the application generates multiple biologic networks with an associated functional analysis to facilitate biological understanding of the dataset. This is a unique Pathway Analysis software that allows researchers to view their data in terms of networks of pathways in an interactomic fashion. There are no pathway analysis packages on the market today that contains the depth of annotated pathways as provided by Ingenuity Pathway Software. This software is presently being used to support an ongoing research project at NHEERL.  Therefore, EPA believes Qiagen, LLC is the only vendor capable of providing the above referenced software. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available. Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored. The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please submit response to Cheri Taylor at taylor.cheri@epa.gov or to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Cheri Taylor, US Environmental Protection Agency, One Sabine Island Drive, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561. No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.
