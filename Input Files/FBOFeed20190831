<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>August 31, 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.0 Description</strong></p>
<p>1.1 The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is seeking information from the public regarding availabilities, capabilities and other pertinent marketplace data for developing animal models, and testing Medical Countermeasures (MCM) against pathogens that require containment in Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. BARDA seeks this information to strengthen its understanding of the current and future marketplace, enhance its ability to obtain quality services economically, and to efficiently and lawfully establish potential vendor source files and listings. The requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>1.1.1 Qualifications, experience and capability to 1) develop animal models for pathogens requiring BSL-4 containment and 2) test MCM against such pathogens.<br />1.1.2 Capabilities should include adequate facilities to develop small and large animal models for BSL-4 pathogens, CDC registration for Select Agent use, and the ability to conduct studies under quality systems.</p>
<p>1.2 <strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</strong>. This RFI is issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.215-3, <em>Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes</em>, and is solely for information gathering and planning purposes. The RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. BARDA intends to use responses to this RFI for planning purposes towards the possible establishment of a network of capable BSL-4 laboratories that would be able to develop and test diagnostics, develop animal models, and test MCM for pathogens requiring BSL-4 containment. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, BARDA is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents to the RFI are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFPs, if any are issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities/FedBizOpps website (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/">https://www.fbo.gov/</a>). It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the site for additional information pertaining to this RFI or potential requirement.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the BARDA, requires the establishment of animal models, for the development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) against Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threats, Pandemic Influenza, and Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID). The mission and priorities of the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) are articulated in the PHEMCE Implementation Plan (link: <a href="https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/documents/2017-phemce-sip.pdf">https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/documents/2017-phemce-sip.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), signed into law on December 19, 2006 and reauthorized in June 2019 under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPAIA), codifies HHS as the lead entity of Federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies and National Response Plan incidents, and specifies that one of the duties of the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is to oversee advanced research, development, and procurement of qualified countermeasures and qualified pandemic or epidemic products. Section 319L (a)(6): Advanced Research and Development subsection (b) "activities includes": ii) Design and development of tests or models, including animal models, for such testing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BSL-4 Pathogens and Need for Laboratory Capacity</span></p>
<p>BARDA is currently developing MCMs against multiple pathogens requiring BSL-4 containment (Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, and Marburg virus). There are a number of other pathogens that would require BSL-4 containment should BARDA be tasked with establishing MCM programs in the future (i.e. Nipah virus, Lassa virus, Hendra virus, etc.). The 2014 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy and Implementation Plan identifies Ebola and Marburg viruses as high-priority threats as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>There are currently no MCMs that are licensed for use against Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, or Marburg virus. The same is true for other pathogens that would require BSL-4 containment. Development of MCMs against these pathogens would require extensive non-clinical testing, as approval would likely occur via the FDA Animal Rule. The capacity of BSL-4 laboratories is limited in terms of numbers and availability. BARDA is seeking to establish a contracting mechanism that enhances this critical MCM infrastructure and provides the ability to rapidly engage BSL-4 laboratories via task order.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Requested Information</strong></p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.

This solicitation is a request for quotations (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2019-02.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 512110 with a small business size standard of $32.5 million.

The Department of Veteran Affairs Network Contracting Office 01 is seeking to purchase the services described in the following Statement of Work.

--------------------------------------------- BEGIN STATEMENT OF WORK -----------------------------------------

Title of Project: IMPROVE Clinical Program Video  

Background:  The VA Connecticut Healthcare System has a requirement for instructional video production (design, scripting, filming, and editing) of two short videos which highlight the IMPROVE initiative which seeks to minimize pharmaceutical risk in older veterans. This is a unique clinical program devoted to improving safety of medication prescribing in older veterans with polypharmacy, or multiple medications. These videos will be used to increase wider implementation of the IMPROVE clinical model to other Department of Veterans Affairs sites. 

Scope of Work:  Contractor will design produce the video in two parts:  
2 - 3 minute (Video 1) introduction to the IMPROVE Clinic; and 
8 - 10 minute (Video 2) overview of the clinic and how it works.   

Period of Performance:  4 months from date of award.

Type of Contract: Firm Fixed-Price

Place of Performance:  VA Connecticut, 950 Campbell Ave, West Haven, CT 

General Requirements
1)  Objective 
IMPROVE is the Initiative to Minimize Pharmaceutical Risk in Older Veterans. It is an interprofessional, experiential educational program for post-graduate primary care trainees to develop their knowledge and skills in addressing polypharmacy in older adults. 

2)  Target Audience 
The audience for both programs is professionals in the medical field. 

Video 1 is designed to appeal to doctors and healthcare executives who are interested in starting an IMPROVE Clinic. The video will provide an overview of how the program works, that it looks like, and the resources and support needed to operate successfully.  The video will present a message of the strong need for such a program, and the problems associated with polypharmacy. It should also indicate any success statistics as may be available. 

Video 2 is designed for trainees or participants who are involved in the program at the West Haven VAMC. This includes residents, nurse practitioners, and other hands-on professionals. The video will provide more detailed information about how the Clinic functions. 

3)  Approach 
The video should begin with a clear objective and message as well as a strong script. This project is envisioned as a voice-over narrative with visuals of the Clinic in action to demonstrate the interdisciplinary team and patient interaction. 

The footage recorded for Video 2   the more comprehensive program   will inform the scenes used in Video 1 e.g., the introduction or  marketing  video. 

Since it is important for the audience to see the Clinic in action, the production team will work with the Yale team to coordinate the recording of a typical day. Actual program professionals will be involved on the clinical side, actors will portray the patients and their families. 

The IMPROVE Clinic has four components, which can all be captured in a day: 
Pre-Clinic Conference 
Shared Medical Appointment 
Individual Visit 
Team Precepting 

In addition, there is a process by which patients are identified and scheduled which happens in advance of the Clinic day. This needs to be part of Video 2 as well.  It is suggested that a graphic technique be introduced in the video to enhance the visuals from the Clinic and further the understanding of the process by the viewer. 

4)  Production Procedure 
Task 1:  Pre-production Planning 
Start the production process with a meeting of the team who will be responsible for the approval of the final product.  This insures there are no surprises and that all personnel are of the same mind with respect to the goals and objectives of the video. 
At this meeting, or by phone, the scriptwriting begins.  Contractor will provide a writer who will work with a VA subject matter expert on the details to be included in the two videos.  
It is essential that the approval team review, correct, then ultimately approve the video script by consensus. 
The script must be finalized before filming so as to maximize time on shoot day. 

Task 2: Video Recording 
The video recording is budgeted for one day on location at the West Haven VA Hospital. 
A production team of up to 4 people on location with HD video camera and supporting lighting and sound equipment is expected. 
Contractor will supply all Patient stand-in actors.
A pre-shoot meeting and walkthrough will be held to go over the logistics of access to the VA Hospital, permissions required, and a visualization of locations to be used to prepare for any sound and/or lighting challenges. 
All Clinic participants must be scheduled for the recording day and  actors  will be brought in to play the role of patients. 
We will all respect HIPPA rules regarding patient confidentiality during the recording, and in post-production. 

Task 3:  Post-production and motion graphics 
Contractor will perform all editorial and graphic work. 
Based upon your needs we schedule the edit into one of our 3 fully staffed rooms. 
After completion of the editing process, the Contractor will provide to the VA a password protected rough cut for review. 
Contractor pricing should include for 1 round of revisions before the final cut is ready for distribution. 

Changes to Statement of Work
Any changes to this SOW shall be authorized and approved only through written correspondence from the Contracting Officer (CO).  A copy of each change will be kept in a project folder along with all other products of the project.  Costs incurred by the Contractor through the actions of parties other than the CO shall be borne by the Contractor.

<DESC>The Naval Supply (NAVSUP) Systems Command, Fleet Logistics Center (FLC), Jacksonville, FL intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Evoqua Water Technologies (EWT) for industrial water supplies for Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE). The Contractor shall provide delivery, pickup, and disposal of carbon and mixed bed resin tanks in sufficient quantities to ensure a reliable and continuous supply of high-purity water at FRCSE. SCU resin tanks have been analyzed and tested by FRCSE personnel, and they have been authorized for use in FRCSE’s wastewater treatment facility. EWT is the only source that can provide this requirement because they own the trademark and patent rights to SCU resin tanks, as confirmed in a letter submitted by the company dated 15 August 2019.


The applicable North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) code that this work falls under is 333318- Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1,000 employees. This notice of intent is for information purposes only. All sources eligible to meet this requirement must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence that clearly articulate the company’s ability to satisfy this requirement as outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response.  If no responses are received within four (4) calendar days after publication of this notice, to demonstrate comparable capability, then a sole source acquisition award will be made.
 Responses to this notice must be sent to tiffany.e.brown@navy.mil.
