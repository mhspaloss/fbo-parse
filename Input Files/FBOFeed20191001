<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the rights to use the data needed to purchase the parts from additional sources are not owned by the Government and cannot be purchased (CLIN 0001).

An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity (CLIN 0002). <br /><br />Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources and their suppliers under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources: Lockheed Martin Sippican, Inc. (Cage 16848). <br /><br />While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision may&nbsp;be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance, and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. <br /><br />The solicitation will be available in DLA DIBBS at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp. on or about 10/15/2019.</p>

<CONTACT>Timothy Shuman, Contract Specialist, Phone 2157379343, Email timothy.shuman@dla.mil - Carrie McKendry, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-737-4669, Email carrie.mckendry@dla.mil
<DESC>The DLA Troop Support intends to solicit for a full-line of produce support for DoD (Troop) customers and Non-DoD (USDA School) customers located in the State of South Carolina. This acquisition will be issued on a small business set-aside (100%) basis. A waiver of the Non-Manufacturer rule has not been requested for this acquisition because it is an acquisition for multiple items. In accordance with 13 CFR 121.406(e), if at least 50% of the estimated contract value of an acquisition for multiple items is composed of items that are manufactured by small business concerns, then a waiver of the Non-Manufacturer rule is not required. As such, for this acquisition, it is expected that items comprising at least 50% of the contract value will be manufactured by small business concerns. The contracting officer must be immediately notified if it appears as though this requirement will not be met. The total length of the contract will be five (5) years. It contains one (1) twenty-four (24) month tier, and two (2) eighteen (18) month tiers. Its estimated maximum total contract dollar value is $225,000,000.00. The delivery points require indefinite quantities of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables throughout the term of the contract. A more detailed listing of the delivery sites can be found in the solicitation. <br />All responsible sources may submit proposals that will be considered by DLA Troop Support. The Government will award a contract(s) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The source selection method for this procurement will be the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures and shall use the following to evaluate offers:<br />1. Technical Acceptability - A technically acceptable offer is an offer that takes no exceptions to the terms and conditions in the solicitation and complies fully with all submission requirements, including submissions relating to the two sub-factors listed below. A proposal that takes exception to solicitation terms and conditions or that fails to comply with all submission requirements may be deemed technically unacceptable and, thus, may be found ineligible, and removed from further consideration for the award. By submitting a proposal with no exceptions, an offeror is confirming it possesses the necessary facilities, equipment, technical skills and capacity to successfully provide all items required by this solicitation. The following sub-factors will be evaluated and must be found acceptable for a proposal to be eligible for award:<br />A. Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) License - The offeror shall possess and submit proof of a valid current PACA license.<br />B. Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Handling Practices (GHP) Audit - The offeror shall submit a valid, current USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate covering a full range of fresh fruits and vegetables for each place of performance identified in the offeror's proposal. The audit report must demonstrate a passing score, and specifically passing in the following parts: General, Wholesale Distribution (6) and Preventive Food Defense (7). In lieu of a USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate, the offeror may submit an audit report / certificate conducted by a recognized private independent third-party certifying company certifying to an industry recognized food safety standard that exceeds all aspects of the USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate requirements. The audit report(s) must demonstrate that a passing score(s) was/were received. NOTE: Offerors relying on a non- USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate must agree to have a USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate for each place of performance by the start of contract performance.<br />2. Pricing - Pricing is required for all items found in the Schedule of Items (for each Group, if applicable) and for all tiers. Failure to offer pricing for all items and for all tiers may result in a proposal being removed from consideration for award as technically unacceptable. The Government will perform an aggregate price analysis on all items found in the Schedule of Items (for each Group, if applicable). To determine an offeror's Evaluated Aggregate Price, the Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price will be added to the Aggregate Delivered Price. Please refer to paragraph (A) of this provision for further details regarding these price components. The award(s) will be made on the basis of the lowest Evaluated Aggregate Price (for each Group, if applicable) of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-price factors. The Government reserves the right to remove item(s) from the Schedule of Items or do a common item comparison if offerors do not submit pricing for all items. Prior to award, the offered prices of the presumptive awardee(s) will be evaluated on an individual line-item basis to determine whether each price is fair and reasonable using analytical techniques deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer in her/his complete discretion.<br />A. Price Components:<br />1. Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price:<br />Aggregate Distribution Price is obtained by first multiplying the proposed distribution price for each item in the Schedule of Items by the item's estimated quantity to calculate the total distribution price for each item. Then, the total distribution prices of all items will be added together to determine the total distribution price for tier 1. The total distribution price for each subsequent tier will also be calculated. The total distribution prices for all tiers will be added together to determine the Aggregate Distribution Price. The Aggregate Distribution Price is then multiplied by a weighting factor of 6 to arrive at the<br />Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price. Note: the weighting factor is applied only to the overall Aggregate Distribution Price (not on a line item basis), and is to be used for evaluation purposes only. The Government's use of a weighting factor of 6 for distribution pricing is done in order to more accurately balance the significance of the pricing components and their respective impact on any subsequent contract(s) issued under this solicitation.<br />2. Aggregate Delivered Price:<br />The Aggregate Delivered Price is obtained by first multiplying the proposed delivered price of each item in the Schedule of Items by the item's estimated quantity to calculate the total delivered price for each item. Then, the total delivered prices of all items will be added together to determine the total delivered price for tier 1. The total delivered price for each subsequent tier will also be calculated. The total delivered prices for all tiers will be added together to determine the Aggregate Delivered Price.<br />3. Evaluated Aggregate Price:<br />The Evaluated Aggregate Price is obtained by adding the Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price and Aggregate Delivered Price together.<br />4. For purposes of the Price Proposal Evaluation, Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price and Aggregate Delivered Price are considered equal. This equality is accounted for mathematically by applying a weighting factor of 6 (based on current Government data) to the Aggregate Distribution Price.
<p>Options are not included in this solicitation.<br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />Past Performance will not be used as an evaluation factor for this solicitation since technical problems are not anticipated. In accordance with FAR 15.304(c)(3)(iii), the Contracting Officer has determined that Past Performance is not appropriate due to the fact that all producers of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables are considered to be technically equal based on historical records of equal technical ratings for past performance. All known vendors have similar records of good delivery of quality items. Past Performance will be considered in a determination of responsibility for the successful offeror prior to award. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. See www.ams.usda.gov/services/auditing/gap-ghp/audit for details concerning program and certification.<br />Copies of the solicitation will be found on www.fbo.gov (FEDBIZOPPS) in a future posting and the DLA- EBS Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil. If not already registered, prospective offerors will be required to do so prior to viewing and downloading a copy of the solicitation. RFPs are in portable document format (PDF). In order to download and view these documents, prospective offers will need the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader. This software is available free at http://adobe.com. Solicitation issue date is expected to be in late October to early November 2019 and will be issued under FAR 15.101-2 Low Price Technically Acceptable (LTPA). The resultant award will be for an indefinite delivery contract, with a guaranteed minimum of 10% of the first year.</p>

<DESC>PROFESSIONAL SERVICES SUPPORT (PSS) 693KA9-19-R-00015

1.  Introduction/Purpose

The purpose of this market survey is to inform industry of the FAAs intent to award multiple new contracts as a follow-on to FAAs En Route Technical Assistance Support Services (ETASS) contracts. This action is required due to the expiration of the ETASS contracts on January 31, 2021. This announcement requests industry input and current marketplace information from both large and small business firms to assist the FAA in its acquisition planning for the forthcoming PSS Program.  
The ETASS vehicle has three incumbent contractors who support the ATO through one hundred and twenty active task orders. A primary objective of the Professional Services Support (PSS) procurement is to streamline the ordering process and reduce the number of task orders. The FAA intends to combine the task orders for each supported directorate and then issue multiple awards. Work orders will be issued as necessary to engage the contract holders and define specific deliverables, service levels, functional areas and skill requirements. The FAA seeks Industry comments on this approach as part of this market survey request.

The duration of the planned awards may be up to seven (7) years with a three (3)-year Base and two, 2 year options.  Task order awards are not anticipated to exceed five (3) years in duration, with added increments of time shown as priced options. Awarded contracts will use a shared ceiling.

The professional and technical support services acquired under this contract will assist in achieving agency strategic goals by providing mission critical support to the following PMO Directorates:

Program Control and Integration (AJM-1): Directorates focus areas include program control, cross-cutting analysis and integration, and special initiatives. Additionally, AJM-1 strengthens the relationships of Mission Support Services, Aviation Safety, and the NextGen organizations among other programs to ensure value for the operation and promised NextGen benefits for airspace users.

Air Traffic Systems Directorate (AJM-2): is responsible for developing, deploying and operating systems that deliver services to all segments of the NAS, including systems that support decision-making for traffic flow managers and systems that provide services directly to pilots for improved safety and efficiency.

Enterprise Services Directorate (AJM-3): develops, acquires, deploys, maintains, sustains, and improves navigation, communications, weather, and aeronautical information products and services for the NAS.  

Surveillance Services Directorate (AJM-4): focuses on the surveillance systems that provide the complete picture for operations taking place in the National Airspace. These systems range from traditional ground based radar to more advanced GPS based positioning systems.

The PSS vehicle will also support other directorates by providing knowledgeable resources to support the ATO objectives of safe, secure, efficient, responsive air transportation system to the nation and global aviation community.

PSS will replace an expiring ETASS contract that provides support services through distinct functional areas. The core functional service areas required under the PSS scope of work include the following:

<RESPDATE>101419
<CONTACT>Bret Muse, Contracts Administrator, Phone 5104866610, Email brmuse@lbl.gov - I am a Contracts Administrator for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and am contacting potential bidders for the ALS-U Removal & Installation Project for Pre-Qualification.  The project is estimated to have a cost of approximately $10 milli, Phone 5104866610, Email brmuse@lbl.gov
<DESC>Researchers at Berkeley Lab have been advancing the scope of human knowledge and seeking science solutions to some of the greatest problems facing humankind since this Laboratory was founded in 1931. Located at One Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, California on a 202-acre site in the hills above the UC Berkeley campus, with spectacular views of the San Francisco Bay, Berkeley Lab is a multi-program science lab in the U.S. national laboratory system, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through its Office of Science (SC). Berkeley Lab is managed and operated by the University of California under Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE").  Berkeley Lab is charged with conducting unclassified research across a wide range of scientific disciplines.
<p>The University seeks to remove existing large scientific research equipment and reinstall new upgraded equipment in Building 6 located on the Berkeley Lab campus. Specifically, the requirement is for a supplier to provide project management and engineering consultation services to design an optimized process for the removal of an existing storage ring and subsequent installation of a new storage ring for the ALS-U project. Additionally, as an option; the University seeks the services of a supplier to perform all scope activities for the removal and re-installation.</p>
<p>The ALS became operational on October 5, 1993. It is a DOE funded synchrotron user facility that provides for more than 2,000 users per year from around the world) access to the brightest beams of soft x-rays, and modest beams of hard x-rays and infrared light, for scientific research and technology development in a wide range of disciplines.</p>
<p>ALS-U is a planned upgrade of the ALS.  The ALS-U will occupy the same facility as the current ALS, only replacing the existing electron storage ring while leveraging approximately $500 million in existing ALS infrastructure and experimental systems. The new ring will use powerful, compact magnets arranged in a dense, circular array called a multi bend achromat (MBA) lattice. In combination with other improvements to the accelerator complex, the upgraded facility will provide bright, steady beams of soft x-ray light to probe matter with unprecedented detail.</p>
<p>During the upgrade the ALS will be unusable for a period of approximately 12 months with 2-3 months are notionally scheduled for removal, 5-6 months are notionally scheduled for installation and 3 months for testing and commissioning.

<p>Anticipated Issue Date: 8 Feb 2019 - Anticipated Closing Date: 8 Mar 2019 - 2:00 PM EST</p>
<p>This synopsis was originally posted under N0016418RJV32.</p>
<p>A solicitation will NOT be posted to Fed Biz Opps due to its sole source nature. The draft agreement will be issued directly to L3 Communications Integrated Systems L.p.</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT - Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement to execute a five-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) to L3 Communications Integrated Systems L.p. for support of all program phases of the Joint Signal Processing (JSP) System including Part Numbers SK14-0126-4, 536441-38, 74201-003, and SMR-5550I-02 utilized in a Multi-Mission System in support of PMA-290 Maritime Patrol Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA). This requirement includes repair, rework and maintenance, spares and replenishment, engineering support services, research and development, test and evaluation, redesign and modification, depot piece-part lay-ins, training, data collection, logistics support services, and travel (as required) to support part numbers/configurations.</p>
<p>The part numbers above include the individual SRAs, support equipment, special tools and tooling, packaging and handling equipment, test equipment and applicable system software/firmware.  Job Orders shall be within scope, issued during the ordering period, and be within the maximum total dollar value of approximately $13,500,000 over a five-year period.  Each Job Order will be synopsized.</p>
<p>The proposed agreement is for the supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, L3 Communications Integrated Systems L.p., 10001 Jack Finney Blvd, Greenville, TX 75402. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of software documentation, test fixtures/stations and technical data including quality/performance acceptance test procedures which prohibit any other source from directly manufacturing Part Numbers SK14-0126-4, 536441-38, 74201-003, and SMR-5550I-02 or performing the required engineering support and repair actions. Duplicative cost and delay are comprised from the cost to procure, re-tool, reverse engineer, generate acceptance test procedures, perform first article testing, acquire flight certification, underway for sub-surface platforms, and perform stress analysis, which would take a minimum of three to five years for development, production, and verification.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this draft agreement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact L3 Communications Integrated Systems L.p. directly.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the internet at https://www.sam.gov.<br />The anticipated agreement award date is First Quarter Fiscal Year Eighteen (19). A Solicitation will NOT be posted to Fed Biz Opps due to the sole source nature of the action. <br /> <br />The point of contact at NSWC Crane is Ms. Allyson Nicholson, Code 0233, at telephone (812) 854-4058 or e-mail: Allyson.nicholson@navy.mil.  The mailing address is: Ms. Allyson Nicholson, Code 0233, Bldg. 3373 Room 223C96, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5001.

NAVSUP FLCN Phila. intends to acquire professional and management services in support of the Naval Aviation Productions Process Sustainment (NAPPS) on behalf of the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA).
 These services will cover management of the aviation officer and enlisted aircrew training processes from initial accession through Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS) completion using Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) tools, concepts, and methodologies.  This enterprise focus requires linkages not only within the established training processes but across the myriad processes within and external to the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE). The contractor will sustain the NAPP production management process by supporting CNAF, CNATRA, USMC TRNGCMD, Training Air Wings and individual Task Groups.  

The contractor will support the members of the NAPT to implement changes, develop and analyze the metrics package provided, prioritize those barriers that require NAPT action, and provide support in development of barrier removal action plans and escalation packages to affect barrier removal in accordance with established NAPP practices.
Specifically, the contractor shall: Support the continued institutionalization and socialization of the NAPP vision and CPI tools across Naval Aviator and NAC training production; Participate as an active member of the Naval Aviation Production Team (NAPT) at all levels, providing Subject Matter Expertise (SME) and ensuring lessons learned and continuity are available to military leadership as they assume their roles in the NAPT; Aid and support production Barrier Identification and Removal efforts across the NAPP as identified by leadership and within resources assigned; Provide ongoing refinement and data quality assurance of an accurate set of production process metrics; Using this data, SME and process experience, deliver recommended process improvements through detailed analysis; Continue to develop, improve, maintain, and provide customer service and training on the proven NAPP tools in support of overall NAPP Training requirements; and Enhance production planning and coordination across the NAPP continuum including planning and execution of multi-year Integrated Production Plans (IPP) and resource requirements modeling using standardized Production Planning Factors (PPFs).

More details of the Governments requirement were contained in the draft PWS provided as a part of the Sources Sought synopsis associated with this procurement, posting number N631102019119.  

It is intended that this sole source action be processed as a modification to existing contract N0018915DZ005.  CNATRA requires a 12-month continuation of the services currently provided under N0018915DZ005 while the contractor re-writes the coding for the WebPPF database and the Naval Aviator Integrated Production Data Repository (NIPDR), an overarching database that was designed and program-coded by CACI.   It is not feasible for the recoding work to be separated from the professional and management services covered under the contract, as the databases need to remain operational while the recoding occurs.

<DESC>NAVSUP WSS is looking to establish a Requirements Long-Term Contract (LTC) for the procurement of Multimeter test equipment that meets the attached Purchase Description (PD). The Requirements LTC will have a 3-year base with two 1-year options. The estimated annual demand is 63 units.

There are two known large business concerns that can fulfill this requirement. Therefore, the proposed acquisition will not be set aside for small business.

It is anticipated that a commercial multimeter can be modified to meet the attached PD. Therefore, this requirement will be based on FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 15. 

The solicitation for this requirement (N0010419QLC76) will be released with additional information that outlines this requirement.
For instance, pricing is not requested since the offeror will be required to submit a Bid Sample that will be evaluated by the Navy Research Laboratory (NRL).
If the submitted sample units are determined technically acceptable by NRL, the vendor will then be asked to provide pricing. This two-step process will be used to determine the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA).

For further information about SOSSEC or how to join, please contact Linda Sasser, (603) 458-5529, <a>lsasser@sossecinc.com</a>.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE</strong>: The below paragraphs are only excerpts from the full Project Announcement. For the full Project Announcement, please contact Linda Sasser, SOSSEC, Inc, (603)458-5529, <a>lsasser@sossecinc.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>: This Project Announcement (PA) is a two-step closed project announcement.</p>
<p>This announcement is being issued to solicit whitepapers only at this time. The purpose of Step 1 whitepaper submissions is to identify potential project-level performers that may have promising technologies or approaches relative to the notional mission described below. Following government evaluation of the whitepaper submissions, the offerors that describe the most promising prototype solutions will be asked to submit proposals against a Step 2 request for proposals.</p>
<p>Upon receipt, the government will evaluate those proposals through a scientific review process in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria to determine which proposals represent the best value to the Government and should be awarded.</p>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: The government seeks a fieldable, directed energy (DE) based counter unmanned aircraft system (CUAS) for the purpose of area defense against group 1 and group 2 class unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and other airborne threats. Both high energy laser (HEL) and high-powered microwave (HPM) based CUAS systems are considered potential solutions.</p>
<p>The overarching government objective is to prototype near production representative, cost-effective DE system(s), integratable with current military battle management systems, that will provide detect, track, identify, and hard kill capability in a range of combat environments. Prototype system(s) will be ops and field tested to inform future production and program of record considerations.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: The 2017 USAF Directed Energy Weapons Flight Plan, signed by the SECAF and CSAF, supports operationalization of DE weapons. Additionally, previous Joint Urgent Operational Needs, Joint Emergent Operational Needs, and a 2018 HQ Air Force Materiel Command Capability Based Assessment, have described a pressing need to enhance military CUAS capabilities. Following an Air Force sponsored campaign of experiments examining the use of DE for CUAS, AFLCMC is conducting follow-on prototyping efforts and evaluating the potential fieldability of DE C-UAS systems. Depending on the needs of the Air Force, the government anticipates that a follow-on production contract or agreement may be awarded to the vendor(s) for this effort without the use of competitive procedures if the systems procured in this transaction are deemed operationally effective and suitable by the Air Force based on criteria and parameters of interest outlined in this document.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong>: The following capabilities/attributes are considered essential technical requirements which must be met for the prototype to be considered successful:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Capable of conducting operations from semi-prepared surfaces (dirt, grass, gravel, etc.) and/or mobile platforms</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Capable of operating without ground support (other than supplied power)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;System must maintain a continual (100% standby) defensive posture.&nbsp; Systems must be capable of sustaining an overall eighty percent (80%) Fully Mission Capable (FMC) rate under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), in a temperature range from 0-degrees to 50-degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Capable of detection, identification, targeting, and/or tracking group 1 and group 2 UAS systems from a distance of 10 km threshold, engaging group 1 and group 2 UAS systems from a distance of 1 km threshold, and destroying group 1 and group 2 UAS systems from a distance of 500 m threshold</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Capable of eliminating UAS systems at a rate of at least 5 per minute</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Capable of being employed by an operator with limited engineering or directed energy experience</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Capable of targeting, tracking, and eliminating target sets within an upper hemispherical field of view.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;Operationally controlled entirely by a single command and control (C2) system</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;Probability of effectiveness operator indication based on atmospheric conditions (a status indication based on atmospheric conditions for probability of effectiveness &gt;50% and &gt;75%)</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;Capable of performing system diagnostics and troubleshooting</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;Capable of day/night operational use.&nbsp; Capable of meeting acquisition requirements, U.S. Military operation use, and meeting U.S. Government releasability/exportability requirements</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong>: It is the intent of the government to award agreement(s) within 90 days of Request for White Paper release if possible. The period of performance is estimated to be 24 months.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The load arrestor is a structural strengthening device that supports the upper part of the ejection seat carriage when the crew member seat is subjected to forward structural (deceleration) loads that could cause seat carriage deflection. The Load Arrestor is a Military Unique and Critical Safety Item (CSI). It is highly specialized because it contains special characteristics which, if not conforming to the design and operation of the part, could result in severe injury to the aircrew or loss of life. The commercial industry does not use ejection seats and therefore does not have the same requirements for a load arrestor.<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />IMPEDIMENT TO COMPETITION: </span></span></strong></p>

<DESC><p>The United States (U.S.) Army Combat Capabilities Development Command - Soldier Center (CCDC-SC), Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), and US Army and Marine Corps' Product Managers will provide informative sessions on Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) camouflage at the upcoming "Joint Advanced Planning Brief for Industry (JAPBI)" on 6-7 November 2019 at Cherry Hill, New Jersey, hosted by Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support Clothing and Textiles. These sessions will introduce to upcoming changes to camouflage spectral reflectance requirements in the Near Infrared (NIR) as well as new SWIR requirements and test methodology to the textile industry. <br /><br />INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: The detection of US Warfighters is an ever increasing threat on the battlefield with the advent of cheaper and better spectral imagers. The emerging threat of the proliferation of SWIR sensors requires the development of advanced signature management technologies to keep our Warfighters protected and allow them to safely complete their mission. Material camouflage developments for the Warfighter has historically focused on the Visual (VIS) and NIR regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The emerging SWIR sensor threat now requires the development of SWIR mitigating materials. For the past few years, the Soldier Protection Survivability Directorate (SPSD) of CCDC-SC and NSWCDD have been focusing on the development of SWIR mitigated printing technology for textiles. This work has been sponsored by the US Army Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE), the US Army Product Manager Soldier Protective and Individual Equipment (PM SPIE) and the US Marine Corps Systems Command - Product Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PM ICE). CCDC-SC will lead in the transition, resourcing, and release of the SWIR apparent reflectivity values, as well as the characterization and measurement procedures. Changes to military specifications and purchase descriptions (PDs) for inclusion of the new requirements and test procedure will be implemented for specific US Army and US Marine Corps uniform materials and end items of interest.<br />&nbsp;<br />New SWIR and NIR target values and test methodology of US camouflage patterns have been established. This data establishes a single apparent reflectance target value in the SWIR and NIR spectrums for each color of the US Marine patterns (MARPAT) Desert &amp; Woodland) and US Army's Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) as well as solid colored Coyote materials . Substrate fabric types and styles include, but not limited to, Flame Resistant fabrics, Nylon/Cotton blended fabrics, and 500 Denier 100% Nylon fabrics, and webbings in camouflaged patterns and solid colors, as well as other fabrics of interest. A final "Summary Table of Validated SWIR/NIR Target Values" will be addressed as replacements for NIR spectral requirements within selected military specifications and PDs and will introduce new SWIR target values for military clothing and individual equipment. Validated SWIR/NIR Target Values will be available to camouflage printers and others in the military textile industry once a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is signed. Information related to target values are currently considered restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. The need to coordinate the signing of NDAs with interested companies is required before release of the SWIR/NIR Target Values.<br /><br />SESSIONS: Two sessions at the JAPBI have been established. One session will provide technical information on the background of SWIR camouflage, background (terrain) data collection used to establish the target values, and the apparent reflectance calculator to assess NIR/SWIR spectral conformance to new SWIR requirements and revised NIR requirements. Another session will focus on US Army's and USMC's acquisition strategy and schedule for requirement changes. Both sessions will have a limited time for Q&amp;A. There will also be an opportunity to schedule a meeting with Government personnel after the 2nd session on November 7, 2019.</p>

<DESC>Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers (COMFRC) is sponsoring an unclassified "Digitizing Production Execution: A Naval Aviation Readiness Challenge" technical information exchange opportunity with Industry on Wednesday, 6 November 2019. Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) Southwest, located in San Diego, CA, will host the event. The purpose of this information exchange is to provide the opportunity to dialogue with Industry on COMFRC's current and anticipated readiness challenges, and inquire into Industry's digital capabilities.
<p><br />FRCs provide Depot Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul, and Upgrade, In-Service Repair, and Manufacturing Services in support of fixed and rotary wing aircraft, aircraft engines, aeronautical components, and support equipment across the Naval Aviation Enterprise, at locations including but not limited to: FRC East in Havelock, NC, FRC Southeast in Jacksonville, FL, FRC Southwest in San Diego, CA, FRC Mid-Atlantic at Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana, VA, FRC West at NAS Lemoore, CA, FRC Northwest at Whidbey Island, WA, FRC WestPAC at Naval Air Field Atsugi, Japan, FRC ASE at Solomon's Island, MD, and FRC Reserve at Patuxent River, MD and their subordinate sites.</p>
<p>The FRCs encounter numerous challenges that would benefit from implementation of modern, digital solutions to improving efficiency and effectivity. At present the FRCs have poor visibility of workload as it moves across the production floor, a high risk of human error and quality defects due to manually dependent systems and processes, subdued environment for innovation, and difficulty maintaining consistency across hundreds of interconnected processes. Combined, these are negatively impacting the command's capacity to support 4th and 5th generation weapon systems. As a result, COMFRC is hosting this technical digital information exchange event to seek commercial industry options for a Production Execution System (PES) to fully digitize production execution (work orders, detailed work instructions, quality management, quality execution, scheduling, material tracking, cloud based data storage, etc.). This solution must integrate with unique Government functionality to specifically include but not limited to the existing Depot Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) system (i.e. the NAVAIR Depot Maintenance System (NDMS)) and recently procured Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), closed loop quality management system and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) system for data management, between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented architecture. The solution must also adhere to overarching DoD Information Assurance and IT Security Requirements. COMFRC is seeking innovative and cost-effective solutions from Industry to these aforementioned complex challenges as well as, opportunities for advanced technology, innovation, enhanced efficiency and compliance through common enterprise solutions across multiple locations.</p>
<p>Vendors considering attendance to this event should submit a three (3) to five (5) page Technical Capability Statement, via email to the POCs listed below, by 25 October 2019. The requested Technical Capability Statement shall be submitted using single-spaced text on 8 1/2 x 11-inch paper, with a minimum one-inch margin all around. Pages shall be numbered consecutively. A page printed on both sides shall be counted as two pages. Print shall be of a minimum 12-point font size or a maximum 10 characters per inch (10-pitch, pica) spacing. Bolding, underlining, and italics may be used accordingly. Graphic presentations, including tables, must adhere to the same font size and spacing requirements and be easily readable.</p>
<p>Please note the cover/title page and table of contents (if provided) will not count against your three (3) to five (5) page limits. Each acronym used shall be spelled out in the text the first time it appears in your technical capability statement.</p>
<p>Attached hereto you will find a list of vendor questions for consideration when preparing your technical capability statement. Please note Technical Capability Statement submissions will not be evaluated for contract award. Lastly, clearly indicate any proprietary data in your responses.</p>

<p><br />The FRCs encounter numerous challenges that would benefit from implementation of modern, digital solutions to improving efficiency and effectivity. At present the FRCs have poor visibility of workload as it moves across the production floor, a high risk of human error and quality defects due to manually dependent systems and processes, subdued environment for innovation, and difficulty maintaining consistency across hundreds of interconnected processes. Combined, these are negatively impacting the command's capacity to support 4th and 5th generation weapon systems. As a result, COMFRC is hosting this technical digital information exchange event to seek commercial industry options for a Production Execution System (PES) to fully digitize production execution (work orders, detailed work instructions, quality management, quality execution, scheduling, material tracking, cloud based data storage, etc.). This solution must integrate with unique Government functionality to specifically include but not limited to the existing Depot Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) system (i.e. the NAVAIR Depot Maintenance System (NDMS)) and recently procured Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), closed loop quality management system and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) system for data management, between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented architecture. The solution must also adhere to overarching DoD Information Assurance and IT Security Requirements. COMFRC is seeking innovative and cost-effective solutions from Industry to these aforementioned complex challenges as well as, opportunities for advanced technology, innovation, enhanced efficiency and compliance through common enterprise solutions across multiple locations.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A SOURCES SOUGHT that will allow the Government to identify interested sources capable of meeting the requirement. The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for quote (RFQ), Request for proposal (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted in response to the Sources Sought. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought, or otherwise pay for any information submitted by respondents to this request.

Said technical data package(s) and data rights are not available through the USG and must be obtained through Textron.</p>
<p>Potential sources are requested to submit a brief summary of their capabilities.</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">At the same time, the Regional Innovation Hubs will facilitate advocacy work and encourage debates around the enabling environment for producers and end-users by highlighting important issues that hinder innovations or the scaling of innovations of the supported innovators (e.g. missing regulations). For this purpose, they establish a report with local representatives of WE4F partners. In addition, they will link up with other bi- or multilateral donor programs to integrate innovations &ndash; where possible &ndash; into these programs.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Complex (FCC), Butner, North Carolina, intends to issue to the current contractor a firm-fixed price, sole source purchase order to Ricoh USA, 70 Valley Stream Parkway, Malvern, PA 19533. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, NC for the period October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020. The Federal Correctional Complex has a need for copier rental in the FCC Butner Medical Department. The Government has determined that Ricoh USA is the only vendor that will satisfy the agency requirements with continuing Copier rental and Maintenance services for the Medical Department. The Government has determined that switching contractors will cause undue burden on the Government. FCC Butner has determined the lack of staffing, background clearance procedures and internal logistical issues will be too burdensome for the Government to replace copiers at this time. This is not a request for competitive quotes and is a Sole Source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1). The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only. However, all information received within 15 working days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Prudence J. Nicklaus, Contract Specialist , Phone 5756495965, Email prudence.j.nicklaus@nasa.gov - Cynthia M. Uribe, Contracting Officer, Phone 5755245486, Email cynthia.uribe@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/Johnson Space Center (JSC) has a requirement for the design, development, and testing of an Electrochemical Oxygen Generator and Concentrator (eCOG-C) capable of producing oxygen at a pressure greater than 3000 psig, and with oxygen purity greater than 99.99%.  This oxygen generator and compressor will enable safe, effective reliable recharge of NASA's Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) spacesuit oxygen tanks.  By incorporating solid oxide electrochemical technology, the core of the oxygen generation system will be solid state, with no moving parts.  The nature of the eCOG-C technology is such that oxygen product purity requirements can be assured without independent chemical analysis and gas sampling.
<div><br />NASA/JSC intends to purchase an eCOG-C from American Oxygen, LLC.  Per NASA's feasibility assessment, issued competitively under RFQ 80NSSC18Q0690-1, American Oxygen is the only vendor able to combine expertise and technology to meet NASA's requirements for oxygen purity greater than 99.99% and be compatible with NASA's current eCOG-C solid state advancements. If awarded to any other source, it would result in substantial duplication of cost and schedule impacts to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. (Mountain Time) on May 17, 2019.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html .</p>

<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT <br />Mission of the U.S. Department of State: The U.S. Department of State is the lead institution for the conduct of American diplomacy and the Secretary of State is the President's principal foreign policy advisor. The Department of State's mission is to advance U.S. national security interests, fight terrorism, protect U.S. interests abroad, and implement foreign policy initiatives that build a freer, prosperous and secure world.</p>
<p>Mission of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL): INL is under the Under Secretary for Democracy and Human Rights (J) and works to keep Americans safe at home by countering international crime, illegal drugs, and instability abroad.  INL helps countries deliver justice and fairness by strengthening their police, courts, and corrections systems. These efforts reduce the amount of crime and illegal drugs reaching U.S. shores.</p>
<p>The INL section at U.S. Embassy Bogota, established in 1985, is among the largest and most complex INL offices in the world.  INL Bogota is charged with developing strategies and programs to achieve foreign policy objectives in the areas of international narcotics control, law enforcement, and justice.</p>
<p>Statement of Availability:  This Personal Services Contractor (PSC) will focus on advising the Colombian government on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its program to increase its eradication efforts as part of the Colombian government's integrated eradication strategy.  In the event the Colombian government resumes aerial spray, this PSC will advise on the planning and implementation of a Colombian-led aerial eradication program.</p>
<p>The Advisor will support the U.S. Embassy/INL Section in Bogota, Colombia; the actual workplace is located at the Colombian National Police (CNP) Guaymaral Air Base in northern Bogota.  The goal of the INL counternarcotics (CN) program is to build Colombian capacity to curtail the supply of illegal drugs from Colombia to the United States through the eradication of illicit coca crops, interdiction of refining laboratories and trafficking activities, dismantling of criminal organizations, expansion of police presence in rural areas, and related law enforcement and military operations.</p>
<p>The PSC will oversee INL Police Aviation Program's (INL-ARAVI) capacity building activities in support of the Government of Colombia's integrated coca crop eradication strategy, including a possible aerial eradication program. The INL-ARAVI fleet consists of 56 USG-supported rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  The position will assist in providing program oversight of the INL aviation support contract.  The ARAVI Eradication Advisor will oversee the development and implementation of contingency planning and all program requirements to include training, logistics, safety, maintenance, and standardization.

Develop the capability of the CNP and other Colombian forces to direct and coordinate aircraft and personnel deployments within Colombia for the purpose of destroying illegal narcotics crops.

 Dissolved Gas Analysis and Testing
REQUIREMENTS:                                                            
Provide equipment, labor, materials, and sample bottles to draw transformer oil sample and test/provide oil dissolve gas analysis and dielectric strength data per ASTM D3612 and ASTM D300-00. 
General: Before attempting to draw the sample, identify the type of cooling liquid in the transformer.  Clean the sample flange and copper/brass tube with a lint-free clean cloth. 
The apparatus to be sampled should be under positive pressure. For transformers sealed with an inert gas, check the pressure gauge to make sure it does not indicate a negative pressure. Ensure that the vacuum will not draw air into the transformer. Attach a length of tubing and filled with clean oil to the sampling valve before cracking the valve open. Carefully observe the direction of oil movement in the tube and close the valve immediately if the oil flow is towards the transformer. Do not allow air to be drawn into the transformer! Air can only enter the transformer when it is under a vacuum. 
Dissolved Gas Analysis and Dielectric Strength
Take a sample while the oil is warm and measure the temperature so that the laboratory can then adjust the results for moisture content. Pre-flush the sample leg and running the oil quietly into a clean glass vessel to minimize degassing and seal the sample securely. Analysis reports shall include following gases but not limited to Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Methane, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, Ethane, and Ethylene. 
Wipe any oil from outer surface of the sample container and place in the shipping container. Place the Sample Data Sheet(s) in a plastic bag and enclose it in the shipping container. 
Report: 
Report shall include but not limited to the transformer location, size, manufacturer, voltage, date of sample. The results of the oil analysis are prepared in a written report and a pdf file.

name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),

into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or

level possible before considering the more formal process described below.

Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or

the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Question #1: Criterion Two, Professional Qualifications, requires a Program Manager and a Task Order Manager.  Please define the difference between these two positions and the requirement of their duties with respect to the IDIQ contract.
	
Response: Program Manager  Program Manager is responsible for managing a group of projects within a program.  In the case of this IDIQ, they are responsible for the contract.
The Task Order Manager can be the Project Manager or the Program Manager.

Question #2:  Per my review of the RFP Synopsis I ran across the excerpt below (in bold) in regards to the selected/awarded firm being precluded from performing construction services.
 Is the term Construction Services (highlighted) as is related to the Federal NAICS Code 236220 which is the code for General Contractor?  	

Response:  On page 4, paragraph 2, Construction Services means geo-tech, topography, concept design, engineering studies and services, cost estimating, and other activities related to construction.  The purpose of this paragraph (in a DB situation and other situations) is to prevent a firm that writes an RFP from being the DOR that is hired by the construction contractor and other conflict of interest.

Question #3:  As we are only providing Geotechnical and Environmental services during the Design Phase and not performing any scope or services as related to General Contractor or 236220 Code will the Geotechnical or Environmental Engineering firm still be precluded from performing Construction Monitoring and Laboratory Testing services (Quality Control) on any projects that these services were provided for this solicitation?	

Response:  Yes.
  

Question #4:  If the answer is yes to the aforementioned question, would the Geotechnical firm have the opportunity to, prior to construction, submit a letter to the Government to request a release from being precluded to bid Quality Control and Testing  services?

Response:  No. 

Question #5:  Will this be a Sole Source or Multiple Award Contract?	

Response:  No.  This will be a single award IDIQ contract.

Question #6:  On the NECO website, I did not see an RFI Questionnaire document.  If there is a formal RFI form that I would need to complete, Ill be happy to request in that manner.  However, Ive never filled out one of these forms nor do I know where to locate one.  If you have one you can send or tell me where to go to locate, it would certainly be appreciated	

Response:  There is not an RFI Questionnaire document.
  Emails containing RFIs will be accepted.

Question #7:  We respectfully request the synopsis be amended to allow Joint Venture offerors to include an executed JVA in their responses, but not include the DUNS, TIN and CAGE for the JV, but include it for each of the partners of the JV instead.  Currently the solicitation makes no distinction between an offeror and a JV offeror.  When establishing a new JV more time is required to register and receive DUNS and CAGE numbers then is available in the response period of the synopsis.
From recent Midlant AE IDIQs for the North IPT and HR IPT, the synopsis was amended to read, If submitting as a Joint Venture, and you do not yet have DUNS, CAGE, and TIN for the Joint Venture, then DUNS, CAGE and TIN should be submitted for each firm.
 DUNS, CAGE and TIN for the Joint Venture, if selected, would be required prior to the award of any contract.  Please consider the application of this language to subject synopsis/solicitation.

Response:  The synopsis will be amended to allow Joint Venture offerors to include an executed JV agreement in their responses, but no include DUNS, TIN and CAGE for the JV.  JV agreements must include DUNS, TIN and CAGE for the respective members of the JV agreement.

Question #8:  Our ability to submit a timely response is directly related to making a prompt amendment to the synopsis.  In addition, please consider extending the due date a week so that Joint Venture documents can be thoroughly developed and executed.
  With the unanticipated move from a SB to an Unrestricted procurement additional planning and teaming was required to respond effectively to NAVFACs requirements which also changed from the previous procurement.

Response:  Due date for proposals will be extended to 14 March 2018.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO RESPOND TO RFIs and to update the Synopsis with the revised Joint Venture Information (Please see information in red.).

Question #9:  I have reviewed the below question and answer regarding JV agreement.  Can you please clarify a bit more?  Must a JV agreement be signed and executed when submitting, and at time of submitting, the proposal and as part of the proposal submission?  
  
We note that recently the KO at NAVFACNW for a similar recent RFP took the position that the JV agreement must be submitted but was not required to be signed and executed at time of proposal submission. It simply needed to be in the final draft form and would be signed if/when contract award was made.
 

Response:  A JV agreement must be signed and executed when submitted as part of the proposal submission.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to this solicitation is to answer the following questions:
The base period is only for six months and there are no options for additional years. Is it correct to assume that there are no option periodsavailable?
Yes.  This is a six-month contract with no option periods.
The Pricing Schedule references " Contractor shall, at all times, maintain the facilities identified accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW)" but the hours of operation referenced elsewhere in the solicitation state6am-4pmand only mon-Fri for a majority of the buildings. Can you confirm the need only to provide service during the operational hours of each building.

The SOW was in error and has been corrected.  The hours of operation for cleaning the buildings are 7:00 am   Midnight.

The Solicitation also references the need to Maintain Aseptic Cleaning Practices in Surgical Rooms, Patient Rooms, but the buildings listed seem to reference mainly support buildings. Can you clarify whichbuildings require which service?
Outer building 21 has a pain clinic; this area includes the patient's exam and treatment rooms; rooms will be treated like patient rooms in the hospital with aseptic cleaning practices set forth by hospital policy.



Be advised, all questions need to be e-mailed to the Contract Specialist.  The Contract Specialist will not take questions over the phone.  Questions will always be answered via an Amendment to the Request for Quote.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the answers to questions received during the solicitation process.
Is BAC OEM Fill Media required? (Please note, in order to guarantee thermal capacity OEM Fill media is recommended. Aftermarket  Block-style  fill media will have an approximate 5% de-rate in performance when compared to BAC OEM fill media.)
The Cooling Tower is at the limit of its capacity. A 5% loss of capacity would be a major problem. Therefore, we will need to use BAC Fill media which would not create a loss in capacity.
Will we be able to drop ship the parts at the worksite or are we going to have to have them delivered at time of repair?
Delivered at time of repair.
Is compressed air available for power tools and water outlet in the event that a pressure washer may be useful?
No compressed air near the job site. Water is available.

ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED!

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY NOTIFICATION<br />Industry Day will be held on October 30-31, 2019.&nbsp; <br /><br />The tentative schedule is as follows:<br /><br />30 Oct 19<br />AM: Introduction, Site Visit, and Q&amp;A Session<br />PM: One-on-Ones<br /><br />31 Oct 19<br />AM: One-on-Ones<br /><br /><br />Industry Day participants are capped at two (2) individuals&nbsp;per company.&nbsp; Please provide the names (first and last) of individuals attending and where they are traveling from.&nbsp; The Government will try to reserve&nbsp;the first day of One-on-Ones&nbsp;for companies that are flying in for the Industry Day.&nbsp; If individuals need Base Access, please provide their drivers&nbsp;license number and&nbsp;state&nbsp;it was&nbsp;issued in.&nbsp; <br />To ensure a One-on-One session is allotted for you, please identify in your response, your desire for a&nbsp;session.<br /><br />Maps and Instructions will be provided at a later date.<br /><br />Responses need to be submitted by October 15, 2019 at 8:00 a.m. (MT).<br />If you do not receive an email confirming receipt of your response by 3:00 p.m. (MT) on October 15, 2019, please contact us by phone no later than October 16, 2019 or your company will not be included as attending for the Industry Day.<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />A <strong>PWS</strong> has been added as well as <strong>Questions</strong>.&nbsp; Please provide your responses NLT 3 October 2019 at 12:00 PM MDT.<br />An Industry Day is planned for the end of October and more information&nbsp;will be posted at a later date.<br /><br />UPDATED QUESTIONS: (The government is seeking more clarity to the questions below).<br /><br />1. Section 3.6.4.1 in the Draft PWS refers to an "OCI Mitigation Plan". How would your company comply with this requirement? This example highlights the Government's concern. If Company X is awarded the ATSSI 2 Contract, they will be in a position to research, identify requirements, and suggest solutions to the Government. If Company X develops test equipment that can fulfill the Government's requirements, the perceived OCI would occur, particularly if Company X identifies their own solutions to the problem. Company Y, who offers competitive products to Company X, would then perceive an unfair advantage to Company X in influencing the Government's decisions. Additionally, if Company Y's solution were selected, Company X would be in a position to have access to proprietary information from Company X. <br /><br />a. The two issues that need to be addressed in an answer is:<br />i. How would you mitigate the first situation's perceived OCI?<br />ii. How would you mitigate the second situation's OCI to protect proprietary data?<br /><br />2. Subcontracting plan: As the ATSSI Prime, there will be many instances of subcontracting work to other companies. How would your company protect the Government from unfair and/or excessive pass-through costs? See Section 3.6.4.2 of the Draft PWS.&nbsp;<br /><br />Please send responses&nbsp;to the POC's listed below.<br /><br />&nbsp;END OF UPDATE_______________________________________________________&nbsp;
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri"><span>&bull;1.<span style="FONT: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />The Government is seeking potential sources to support a follow-on contract for its AUTOMATED TEST SYSTEM SUSTAINMENT INITIATIVE (ATSSI). <br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />The 309 Maintenance Wing at Hill AFB (309 MXW) has a large volume of Automated Test Systems (ATS) that support end items from several different Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), incorporate ancillary equipment from various vendors in the build/design, and require coordination with multiple OEMs/vendors when such systems are modified, repaired, or replaced. Many of these systems are unique to 309 MXW and as such, have no commercial equivalent. <br /><br />309 MXW is facing operation, maintenance, performance, and infrastructure support issues for a growing number of computer-based test stations. Many of these systems are obsolete, duplicative, do not properly interface with Units Under Test (UUT), require unique/costly repair solutions, and/or require specialized sustainment in order to remain operable. 309 MXW established the original ATSSI contract to integrate, update, and consolidate ATS, test fixtures, TPS, database repositories, analytical software tools, and network infrastructures. <br /><br />SCOPE <br />The follow-on ATSSI program is referred to as ATSSI II. Under ATSSI II the contractor shall serve as a complete ATS integrator and be fully capable of supporting design, manufacture, validation/verification, delivery, installation, drafting, Technical Order (TO) changes/updates, software, hardware, OEM coordination, System Program Office (SPO) coordination, test program sets, trouble shooting, government data rights concerns, and any other requirements identified throughout the pre-solicitation phase for this program. <br />A draft PWS with additional information will be posted at a later date. <br />Action <br />Please review and respond to the RFI questions below. Your responses are a critical part of the market research process and will aid the Government in determining industry capability and acquisition strategy. <br /><br />RFI QUESTIONS<br />1. Please provide your Company Name, Cage Code and size under NAICS 541512<br />2. Please identify any recent &amp; relevant DoD/commercial contracts<br /><br />Capability Survey<br />1. Describe your company's history with the development &amp; implementation of Test Program Sets (TPSs) for the DoD Standard Families of Testers.</p>
<p>2. Describe your company's experience with developing and implementing documentation for Test Program Sets for (ATS) utilized by the USAF to include standards, format types, and stakeholders involved. Provide examples.</p>
<p>3. Describe your company's experience with developing engineering drawings and submitting them to USAF document repositories.</p>
<p>4. What are your company's configuration control standards or protocols?</p>
<p>5. What is your company's experience working with organizational conflict of interest (OCI) issues? Has your company developed an OCI mitigation plan in the past?</p>
<p>6. What is your company's experience with government data rights requirements and clauses?</p>
<p>7. Does your company maintain close relationships with any major manufacturers or suppliers of widely-used ATS COTS components?</p>
<p>a. What is the basis of, or how formal are these relationships?<br />b. How long have these relationships been maintained?<br />c. Provide examples of specific relationships</p>
<p>8. Does your company have the resources available to quickly analyze ATS failures, perform root cause analysis, and repair or quickly subcontract the repair of typical ATS?</p>
<p>a. Provide two examples of situations where your company has provided this service</p>
<p>9. Provide a brief overview of your company's capability for developing, maintaining and repairing both software and hardware for ATS and all associated documentation updates.</p>
<p>10. This effort will require purchasing large value (multi-million dollar) equipment, materials and services. In many instances, payment will take months after invoicing. Describe your company's financial capacity to make these purchases and wait until payment is made by the USAF. Progress payments or government financing is not available at this time.</p>
<p>11. Under ATSSI II the contractor will be required to negotiate Task Order/Delivery Order pricing with the Government. Describe your company's experience with and capability to rapidly develop cost proposals, submit cost and pricing data as applicable, and negotiate with the Government Contracting Officer IAW FAR Part 15 requirements.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT #1 - PROGRAM SUPPORT SERVICES(PSS) 693KA9-19-R-00015

The purpose of this announcement is to publish the list of companies that gave FAA permission to have their information publicized after responding to the subject Market Survey. FAA stated in the subject Market Survey the intent to publicize this list.  FAA intends for this listing to promote teaming and subcontracting opportunities within the business community. Those respondents that desired to have their name publicized are listed in the attachment provided with this announcement. Additionally, the name and phone number of the designated points of contact are provided.

This Amendment also corrects the Program title from the title of: Professional Services Support to the title of: Program Support Services. The correct title for the subject requirement is Program Support Services and this is the title that will be used in future announcements associated with this requirement. 

The FAA is currently in the process of reviewing capability packages and industry comments provided in response to the subject Market Survey.  The FAA does not intend to directly respond to public inquiries or recommendations related to this Market Survey. The FAA intends to use Industry information and comments, provided in response to the Market Survey, to assist the FAA in defining the requirements.

All other information related to this Market Survey remains unchanged.

For more information related to Small Businesses and Teaming Arrangements, refer to the FAAs Small Business Office Website www.sbo.faa.gov. The FAAs small business data base, Source-Net, is a good resource to find potential partners/teaming arrangements.

<p>This is an amended notice to the original previously sent out.&nbsp; Due to lack of interest and competition within the original NAICS, the Contracting Officer is requesting firms from the below NAICS, Small Business and Women Owned designation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to determine availability and capability of qualified Small Businesses, Woman Owned Small Businesses.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice will be used for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.</p>
<p>This procurement will be advertised under North American Industrial Classification 238220 - Plumbing, Heating and Airconditioning Contractors.&nbsp; Small Business Size Standard $16.5M.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSC Code: J046 Maintenance, Repair, and Rebuilding of Equipment- Water Purification and Sewage Treatment Equipment</p>
<p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
<p>The FDA Bothell PNWRL is located at 22201 23rd Dr. SE, Bothell, WA. 98021 and is a 2 story building in downtown Bothell, Canyon Park Industrial Park. The FDA Bothell Facility was built in the early 1980s and has had several upgrades over the years.  The facility is an active lab space.  The staffing and manner in which the agency conducts business has changed.</p>
<p><strong>Scope Summary</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to replace the existing RO/DI water purification system with a combination of point of use benchtop water purification units in six rooms and a pure water central system in the mechanical room that feeds polishers in four locations.</p>
<p>The existing in-house RO/DI water system in the Pacific Regional Laboratory Northwest Laboratory is more than 26-years old.  During the past several years the DI water system has broken down multiple times and required emergency services due to pipe connection failure and other system integrity issues and resulted in system downtime and water damage. Pure water is essential to daily sample analysis and the preparation of necessary media and reagents.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Description &amp; Approach</strong></p>
<p>The Chemistry and Microbiology Branches of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pacific Northwest Laboratory have a requirement for Point of Use Water Purification systems to be provided a limited scale premanufactured feed water system to serve limited areas, and associated work (including installation).   These systems shall reliably produce, dispense, and automatically monitor the quality of purified water within defined water quality parameters. The vendor shall provide all required labor, equipment, materials, supporting utilities, appurtenances and accessories, installation, restoration of facility, equipment start-up services and training. Work shall be provided in conformance with all requirements of this Statement of Work. The delivery of equipment shall be coordinated with the schedule of completion of construction of utilities to support the purification equipment. The need for rapid equipment delivery should be assumed.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials and hardware to provide for fully functional water purification systems in the ten rooms as shown on the attached facility diagram.</p>
<p>A total of five standard capacity point of use purification systems, one high capacity point of use purification system, one point of use polisher, and one pretreatment feed water system each at different locations within the facility, in accordance with this document and as approved by the on-site FDA project manager. The pure water central system in the mechanical room will feed multiple rooms designated in the Scope of Work. The point of use units to be installed in six (6) rooms and will require backflow preventers, electrical outlets, shelving and associated work for fully functional systems.  The contractor will remove all central purification plant equipment and all piping valves and associated components and install new equipment and supporting utilities for a full purification system replacement.  Penetrations that will not be used for new piping shall be neatly sealed with appropriate fire caulking and finish coatings.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for moving items to gain access to work areas and will be responsible for providing appropriate protection for the building, property and equipment.  The tenant will need access to purified DI water during the project. The tenant has benchtop units in use in several rooms and that equipment shall remain in place until the later part of the project when the other new systems are fully functional.</p>
<p>Water Purification Systems shall be provided complete, fully operational, sanitized, and calibrated for use, including all required accessories for compliance with the Scope of Work.<br /> <br />The existing RO/DI system shall be fully removed including all equipment, hangers, piping, insulation and hardware.  Clean, prepare and paint the concrete pad prior to installing the new equipment in the mechanical room.  Verify electrical loads for each panel to be used to serve new equipment.  Install a new disconnect switch in the mechanical room for the RO/DI equipment</p>
<p><strong>Unique Situations/Risks </strong></p>
<p>The facility location, coupled with the need for continuous operation during construction, present unique challenges for the design/build teams on the project. Facility will remain fully occupied and operational during the entire project. Life safety of the tenants will be protected at all times. No adverse impact on tenant mission will be acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Occupied Facility Construction </strong></p>
<p>The RO/DI installation at the FDA Bothell PNWRL must occur within an occupied, fully functional facility. These functions include typical office work, but also include services for the Laboratory testing and evaluation. This presents several challenges that will have to be addressed by the Installation Team.</p>
<p>&bull;	All work in public spaces will need to be completed during unoccupied periods.<br />&bull;	Setup, construction, and clean-up will need to occur on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Responses</strong></p>
<p>Interested small business vendors in the categories listed above shall submit their capability statement electronically, limited to 10 double sided pages. The capability statement shall be in sufficient in detail to allow Government to determine the organization's related qualifications to perform the work. The statement shall include:</p>
<p>1)	a) Company name. <br />b) CAGE code. <br />c) DUNS number. <br />d) Active SAM registration printout (www.sam.gov).<br /> e) Size/number of employees.</p>

The site encompasses approximately 40 acres and contains a large production building and warehouse, two abandoned rail spurs, and several smaller process and support buildings. The surrounding area west, north, and east of the site is primarily residential farmland. <br />The site was used for beryllium processing in support of the national defense program from 1949 to 1961.

<p>v. Toxicology Coordination: Assist in coordination of toxicology programs within the sponsoring agencies.</p>

        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1)   This requirement was previously solicited under RFQ # 36C24619Q0625. This solicitation was protested by BD and Corrective action was to review the acquisition strategy and resolicit. Accordingly, Biomerieux is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the Veteran s Health Administration experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. Biomerieux is the only known firm that has an automated blood culture device capable of  recognizing expired bottles,  over-filled and under-filled bottles with real-time notification alarms. Additionally, it is the only firm that can provide a  device with a data management system with motion-activated loading to provide rapid entry of bottles and a  fully automated unloading system with visual and audible alerts. These are minimum needs of VISN 6 stations Asheville, Hampton, Salem, and Salisbury. Based on the additional information received, the CO following legal opinion, determined the best acquisition strategy to be a sole source.


Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
Sources Sought Synopsis: A sources sought notice was issued to the vendor found on VIP, on FBO, and on GSA eBuy from 05/30/2019 to 06/06/2019. Two responses were received from the GSA contract holders Becton Dickson and Company (BD) and bioMerieux, Inc. After speaking with BD with regards to the VA s needs, it was communicated that they are not capable of providing a system that is capable of  recognizing expired bottles,  over-filled and under-filled bottles with real-time notification alarms, and provide a  device with a data management system with motion-activated loading to provide rapid entry of bottles and a  fully automated unloading system with visual and audible alerts.

Determination by the CO that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The Fayetteville VAMC currently has a contract for the exact same equipment under contract # 36C24618D0117. The CO will use the past prices, that have already been deemed fair and reasonable, to negotiate the best pricing for the government. If deemed appropriate, the CO will request other than certified cost or pricing data to perform a price analysis.  

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research sources include, VIP, FPDS, GSA eBuy, FBO, sources sought notice, Google, past acquisitions, and conversations with industry professionals. VIP was searched utilizing NAICS code 325413 and key word  blood culture . One vendor was found, a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), AvKARE. Inc. A FPDS search utilizing the key words  blood culture  showed that BD and bioMerieux combined make up over fifty percent of government purchases for blood culture needs. 

VISN 6 stations Hampton, Asheville, Richmond, Salem, and Salisbury are currently utilizing BD products to fulfill their blood culture needs.

A sources sought notice was issued to the vendor found on VIP, on FBO, and on GSA eBuy from 05/30/2019 to 06/06/2019. Two responses were received from the GSA contract holders Becton Dickson and Company (BD) and bioMerieux, Inc. BD s FSS contract is due to expire in October of 2019. BD and the VA National Acquisition Center (NAC) are currently in negotiations for a new contract. bioMerieux s FSS contract is due to expire in May of 2021. A FSS BPA is not considered to be the best acquisition strategy because the vendor does not offer all of the required items on their FSS contract.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: There are no other facts at this time. 

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Becton Dickson and Company (BD) and bioMerieux, Inc.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:   In order to overcome barriers to competition, the VA will continue to issue sources sought notices for future acquisitions in an attempt to locate other blood culture devices that meet the VA s needs.

Authority:

ORDER AGAINST FSS: Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6. Mark the applicable exception:

An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays(FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A);

   Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B));

In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order and the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C)); or

Items peculiar to one manufacturer. An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer). A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer (FAR 8.405-6(b)).

Rational/explanation to support cited authority: PBI products include PBI proprietary software and only PBI has the exclusive rights to modify such software as required to correct software issues. PBI is the only manufacture authorized to provide additional licenses and software/firmware updates for SendSuite Live Software, Connect+ and SendPro mail machines. Connect+ and SendPro postage meters are owned by PBI, licensed through the USPS and PBI is the only vendor authorized to provide the postage meter for your Connect+ and SendPro mail machines that can interface to the current SSL software

Note that this determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6. The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.


CONTRACTING OFFICER S CERTIFICATION (Required IAW FAR 8.405-6(c)(2)(ix),
FAR Part 13, FAR Part 15 or FAR Part 16): I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C252-19-AP-3135 

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 115 S. 84th Street, Suite 101, Milwaukee, WI 53214-1476. Purchase requests pertaining to this acquisition are; 695-20-1-133-0005/0006/0007/0008/0011 and 0013.

Description of Action: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 251 and 40 U.S.C. 501).  This action is a new requirement for a one-year (12 month) firm-fixed price task order against a NAC contract to perform services for High Tech Medical Equipment (HTME).

Order against:     FSS Contract Number: V797H-17-D-0024
Name of Proposed Contractor:
General Electric Company (GE)
Street Address:
3000 N. Grandview Blvd., W-443
City, State, Zip:
Waukesha, WI 53188-1615
Phone:
312-636-2344
Description of Supplies or Services:

Estimated value of the proposed action is $1,550,845.48.
VISN 12 Biomedical Engineering has a requirement for GE imaging equipment preventative maintenance and emergency repair services.  The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to provide these services.  These services are critical for the continuity of patient care and are required at six of the VISN s medical centers. The diagnostic imaging equipment is used for creating visual representations of the interior of the body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. Some modalities also provide a visual representation of the function of some organs or tissues.These services are critical to maintaining the equipment in good operational order so the VA can meet its mission of delivering high quality care to veteran patients.  Service will require remote access through GE s proprietary software. Remote access is required to maintain all available support methodologies to maintain uptime of the equipment. Attachment A has the listing of the equipment also identified on the service schedule.  
Period of performance: 10/01/2019   09/30/2020.

 (4) IDENTIFY THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (C) or 8.405-6(b)), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  


 Only one source can provide the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. Remote access is required with site to site VPN utilizing GE s proprietary software to maintain operable 95% uptime availability. The imaging equipment is specialized High Tech Medical Equipment (HTME).  GE is the only vendor with an Interconnection Security Agreement/Memorandum of Understanding (ISA/MOU) mandated by VA Directive 6500 to service the equipment.

 Items peculiar to one manufacturer: 

 A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
See Attachment A for a complete list of radiology equipment used for diagnostic imaging of the internal body. 


 These are  direct replacements  parts/components for existing equipment.  

 The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.


(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  The task order will be placed against a National Acquisition Center (NAC) contract, VA797H-17-D-0024, which has been determined to be fair and reasonable per FAR Part 8.404 (d). The total asset value of these items is over $18M (See Attachment A for complete equipment listing).   The level of coverage required by each Medical Center covered under this agreement was determined by their Biomedical Engineering leadership at those respective Medical Centers to meet regulatory and patient care requirements.   The estimated value of this order to maintain existing equipment is $1.5M which is approximately 8% of the total asset value.   This cost is reasonable based on the VA Enhanced Biomedical Engineering Resource survey where the national average for full service contract coverage is 9% of the total asset value.   

If the VA were to pursue replacing existing imaging equipment, it is estimated to cost over $20M based on inflation including $1.5M in construction costs to accommodate site preparations; of which 20% is based off the average cost to install an imaging modality (not all equipment included requires construction for installation).  The equipment listed on Attachment A is at various stages of life cycle and separate processes are underway for replacement planning at each Medical Center and in the VISN. At this time, based on current operability of existing equipment, reasonable cost of maintenance services and the prohibitive cost of replacement, the VA determined that maintaining the existing equipment through an order for maintenance service represents the best value. The Joint Commission requires under Environment of Care (EOC) standard 2.04 that we maintain diagnostic imaging equipment according to manufacturer requirements.   This contract was determined as the best method to meet that requirement as well as ensure that veterans receive timely diagnostic imaging care.    The total asset value of these items is over $18M (See Attachment A for complete equipment listing).   The level of coverage required by each Medical Center covered under this agreement was determined by their Biomedical Engineering leadership at those respective Medical Centers to meet regulatory and patient care requirements.   The estimated value of the contract is $1.5M with is rough 8% of the total asset value.   This cost is price reasonable based on the VA Enhanced Biomedical Engineering Resource survey where the National average for full service contract coverage is 9% of the total asset value.   Equipment included in this agreement is coming off warranty or has been off warranty for several years and covered under previous agreements with GE through task orders against the NAC/DOD contract on an annual basis.   Any lapse in service agreement coverage could result in the manufacturer no longer covering high cost items such as x-ray tubes and imaging detectors.   It is estimated that could put the VA at risk of additional expenses of $500,000 annually as emergency requirements.     


(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: The Contracting Officer reviewed the Veteran s Information Pages (VIP) under three different criteria however, no SDVOSB/VOSB vendors were found that meets the minimum requirements and the VA s Rule of Two. An intent to sole source notice (36C25220Q0014) was posted to FBO from 7/26/19   8/5/19. Upon expiration of the notice, no vendor responses were received.  Furthermore, market research showed only one schedule holder is capable of meeting this requirement.


(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION: GE already possesses the security documentation needed upon award to allow for remote access to the equipment located at the various facilities.


(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE: This procurement consists of maintenance support and service for high-tech medical equipment. The basic service requires remote access to the equipment and GE does not allow other vendors or manufacturers access.  In the future, when new equipment is procured, the Government will attempt to include a service agreement with the purchase of the equipment.  This initiative may increase competition while lowering the overall cost by having prospective offerors consider maintenance in their pricing.
 

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor s supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)

Revision 08 Date: 04/18/2018
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>SAT)

Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C252-19-AP-3421

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 115 S. 84th Street, Milwaukee, WI 53214. Transaction 695-20-1-6134-0001.

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This procurement is for preventative maintenance on the nurse call system to include updates/upgrades to the proprietary software in accordance with FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2.  This new contract action will be, awarded on a firm-fixed price basis and includes a 12-month base period of performance with three 12-month option periods.
Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  The Clement J. Zablocki Medical Center has a requirement to maintain and upgrade the nurse call system.  These services are critical for patient care, as the nurse call system is a vital link between patients and nursing staff.  Service includes emergency and non-emergency updates and upgrades to the systems software.
       Total estimated value (base and three options): $679,500.00.00
       Base period of performance: 10/1/2019   9/30/2020


Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901 Simplified acquisition procedures as implemented in FAR 13.501.

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Services include software updates and upgrades to the proprietary software currently supporting the nurse call and code blue systems. The vendor must be able to install all updates and upgrades as required/needed by the system. Due to proprietary software, no other vendors are able to access the software. 


Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  The Contracting Officer conducted market research with VIP, SBA, GSA, FBO, FPDS and the internet for sources however, none were identified that could perform the service. A notice of intent to sole source to Systec Limited was posted to FBO from 9/6/19-9/12/19 however no responses were received. 

Determination by the CO that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated cost will be considered fair and reasonable based on comparison with historical contract VA69D-15-C-0276 and the IGCE. 

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  The Contracting Officer queried the Veterans Information Pages (VIP) in accordance with the VAAR Class Deviation 810.001-70 to determine if two or more service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses were listed. No vendors were identified that could service the Wisconsin area. Searched SBA for any current 8(a) certified businesses, veterans disadvantaged businesses, service disabled, and women owned businesses, no firms were found. Conducted an internet search, FBO, GSA and FPDS search with only Systec as a viable vendor. 
As described in Section 6 above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: The nurse call system was installed as part of a construction project. Since the original installation the system was expanded due to patient care area renovations. Installing a completely new system would not be cost effective.  

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Systec LTD of Wisconsin Inc, 12645 W. Burleigh Rd #10, Brookfield, WI 53005-3102.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  There is only one source for the required maintenance service of the nurse call system. The Contracting Officer will continue to conduct market research and synopsize future requirements for these same services to see if any additional vendors can provide these services to the Government.  In addition, the Government will consider including a maintenance agreement in any subsequent equipment replacements.  


Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

JUSTIFICATION
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1. Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Procurement, Acquisition and Logistics
Technology Acquisition Center
23 Christopher Way
Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2. Description of Action: The proposed action is for the award of a firm-fixed-price task order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for hardware and software maintenance support for brand name R-Comm Systems PT2020 Radio Paging Terminals. 

3. Description of Supplies or Services:  This requirement is to procure hardware and software maintenance support for brand name R-Comm Systems PT2020 Radio Paging Terminals.  The Contractor shall at a minimum, provide the following paging system maintenance support on the following components: main RComm PT2020 radio paging terminal, backup RComm PT2020 radio paging terminal, R-Comm paging encoder, paging tone remote interface board, main high power Bluewave Broadband Neptune series paging transmitter, backup paging transmitter, main paging antenna, main antenna transmission line, backup paging antenna, backup antenna transmission line, critical hardware and software upgrades within one business day of release, non-critical hardware (HW) and software (SW) upgrades within one month of release.  In addition, the Contractor shall ensure system documentation is current, provide on-site visits to ensure the proper operation of the components, training, and system performance.  The Contractor shall also provide technical support for emergency troubleshooting as required, and extra pager programmers, tools (ex. tools for antennae repair/troubleshooting) and other components, as required, to keep these paging systems operating properly.  The Contractor shall provide 24/7 telephone technical support, immediate replacement of defective on-site Contractor HW/SW components, and replacement, within four hours, of defective VA facility HW/SW components.  The Contractor shall provide Onsite or Virtual Training of key personnel at the VISN 23 facilities in the operation and technical maintenance of the equipment and systems. The period of performance shall be one 12-month base, with three 12-month option period.  
 
4. Statutory Authority: Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(a)(4), the following brand name requirement is being justified and approved as an exception to fair opportunity under the statutory authority of Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized .

5. Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Based on extensive market research as described in section 8 of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is available among R-Comm Systems PT2020 Radio Paging Terminal resellers for this brand name requirement.   Only R-Comm or its resellers can provide access to the proprietary equipment and source code necessary to maintain the existing system. Use of any other maintenance support wouldn t have access to the proprietary code base and configurations necessary for R-Comm Systems PT2020 Radio Paging Terminals to operate correctly. Specifically, only R-Comm, or a reseller, can maintain the paging encoder and paging system software included in the existing system.   Only R-Comm Systems or a reseller can provide the necessary maintenance updates to these components due to proprietary source code.  Failure to maintain these components would render the existing system inoperable.  Use of another brand would require replacement of the existing infrastructure at additional cost which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Failure to secure these services would result in loss of a system vital to patient care. The internal paging system provides critical response capabilities with Code Blue events.  In these situations, the ability to respond timely to patient emergencies can have a significant impact on their healthcare and survivable outcome of the event.  The use of in-house pagers provides the ability for immediate notification of the healthcare team to respond to the patient emergency.  Failure to maintain the paging system jeopardizes these life safety capabilities.  

6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements.  However, it was determined that limited competition is viable among resellers for these brand name items.  

7. Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if more products become available regarding R-Comm Systems PT2020 Radio Paging Terminals.
 
8. Market Research: Market Research was conducted on September 4, 2019 by releasing a Request for Information (RFI) number 36C10B19Q0722 to vendors on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website.  The FBO RFI closed on September 9, 2019 and yielded two responses, one of which had a partnership with a NASA SEWP reseller.  The two responses were evaluated by the Government technical experts, Bob Merchant and Brian Bornick.  While more than one vendor may be capable of performing the maintenance support, it was determined that access to the R-Comm proprietary information was required to perform this requirement. Due to the proprietary nature of the R-Comm Systems PT2020 Radio Paging Terminals, only the brand name components can be used in the proprietary system.  No other products are interoperable or compatible.  Using a product other than the brand name R-Comm Systems PT2020 Radio Paging Terminals would require a full system replacement which is cost prohibitive.  Based on this market research, it has been determined that only R-Comm Systems PT2020 Radio Paging Terminals or its authorized resellers have access to the proprietary source code to meet all of VA s needs.  

Additional market research on September 5, 2019, the VIP database was screened for a list of all Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs) under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519,  Paging Systems.   The results of the search found a total of 1,237 SDVOSBs and VOSBs under the NAICS code 541519.  In addition, there is past procurement history for this requirement, which demonstrates that NASA SEWP SDVOSB resellers are capable of providing this maintenance support.

9. Other Facts: None.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) proposes to negotiate a sole source contract modification with KBRwyle, located at 1290 Hercules Ave Ste 120, Houston, TX 77058, to extend the current period of performance for contract number NNAl4AB82C, Fully Integrated Lifecycle Mission Support Services, commonly referred to as (FILMSS), for up to<br />eighteen months. The period of performance (POP) of the CPFF Core and ordering period of the CPFF IDIQ is to be extended. The purpose of the extension is to provide on-going program, science, engineering, operations and project management support for mission critical requirements at NASA ARC pending completion of a competitive follow-on procurement, FILMSS II. The extended period of<br />performance would consist of a one eight (8) month base period of performance and five (5) two-month option periods and would extend the period of performance from August I, 2019 to January 31, 2021, if all options are exercised.

<p>FAR Part 6 Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. Contracting Activity: U.S. Army Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Fort Lee, 1830 Quartermaster Road, Building 7124, Fort Lee, VA 23801.</p>
<p>2. Description of Action: The Department of Public Works (DPW) requests a firm- fixed-price contract modification to contract W911SF-14-D-0010 with Leebcor Services, LLC., 430 Mclaws Circle, Suite 201, Williamsburg, VA 23185-5655 to add the six (6) month extension in accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.217-8. The Government projects award for September 2019 and fiscal year 2019, Operations and Maintenance funds will be used. An acquisition plan is not required because this procurement does not meet the threshold at Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 207.103(d)(i)(B).</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: Under the contemplated contract modification to add FAR Clause 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services", the contractor shall continue to provide the exact same services as currently being provided consisting of construction services, including all management, labor, tools, equipment, and materials, except as specified in the schedule or under task orders to be furnished by the Government, necessary or incidental to the performance of a broad range of maintenance, repairand minor construction work on real property at Fort Lee, Virginia, in accordance with Job Order Technical Specifications.</p>
<p>The construction services to be provided include the management, planning, and execution of a broad variety of sustainment, maintenance repair and minor construction work for government facilities consisting of, but not limited to, office buildings, classrooms, shops, storage areas, barracks, dining facilities, HVAC systems, storm drainage systems, civil works, electrical systems, parking lots, road ways, bridges and culverts, landscaping, fire stations, security stations, renovation/repair projects, utility buildings, utility systems, and site improvements, on an as needed basis. These services shall be furnished in response to duly authorized task orders issued in accordance with the "Ordering Procedures."</p>
<p>A Job Order Contract (JOC) greatly reduces the amount of estimating and bidding activities needed to precede the work, allows for quicker delivery, and helps foster long- term relationships between the client and the general contractor which are based on the quality delivery of construction and services. A JOC is philosophically similar to the design-build methodology that is used for "ground up" (e.g., new buildings) facility construction. It helps expedite minor construction and routine repair and maintenance of worldwide military facilities in order to decrease the inherent inefficiencies in traditional design-bid-build practices when applied to a large volume of small projects.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 30 September 2019 to 31 March 2020, made in one-month increments<br />Total Value: $</p>
<p>Version - September 2018 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />3</p>
<p>4. Authority Cited: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>5. Reason for Authority Cited:</p>
<p>a. As described at FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), when the supplies or services required by the agency are available only from one responsible source, or for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other types of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.</p>
<p>Leebcor, the incumbent contractor, is the only source possessing the trained personnel assets, management team, institutional knowledge, equipment, and other resources to continue the required tasks without any break in service. Delays in extending the contract would result in serious injury to the Government, financial and otherwise.<br />Leebcor has been successful in meeting the JOC's cost, schedule, and performance requirements. The current JOC (W911SF-14-D-0010) was awarded as a competitive 100% Small Business (SB) set-aside and it is scheduled to expire on 29 September 2019. The JOC follow-on competitive re-compete procurement began in November 2018; however, significant changes to the requirement occurred between March-July 2019 which affected the Acquisition Strategy as well as the procurement timeline.<br />Exercising the six (6) month extension will enable the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) the additional time to ensure the requirements package encompasses all changes. Solicitation W91QF5-19-R-0008 will be posted on or about 20 September 2019 and proposals due 19 October 2019. Evaluation of proposals received is anticipated to be completed by 15 November 2019. The Government anticipates awarding the FY20 JOC by December 2019. The extension will be exercised in one- month increments to allow for uninterrupted services and in the scenario of any protest(s) once the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>Impact: Without extending the JOC contract, DPW would suffer serious set-backs which may result in mission failure for the several units and organization within Fort Lee, VA. Critical construction, maintenance, and repair projects would come to a halt especially during the upcoming hurricane season in which several projects could be required with little to no advance notice. There are no other known contract vehicles capable of providing the use of another source. The Department of the Army, does not have the organic resources necessary to meet mission requirements; therefore, the DPW must have continued contract support through the JOC extension.</p>
<p>b. Alternatives:</p>
<p>1) Suspension of Operations. Suspension of operations is not a viable option. Without facility maintenance services, many areas of the installation will not be able to operate and have to be closed. Facility maintenance services cannot be acquired for</p>
<p>Version - September 2018 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />4</p>
<p><br />Fort Lee within the time constraints without utilizing the services of Leebcor. Closing areas of the installation would negatively affect the mission and is not considered a feasible option.</p>
<p>2) Use of In-House Resources. There are no in-house resources capable of satisfying the requirement of Fort Lee's facility maintenance requirements. Government personnel cuts and reliance on contractors to perform critical facility maintenance functions over the years have resulted in a shift of technical expertise from the Government to private industry. The amount of time required to recruit and hire qualified Government personnel with the requisite skills through the civilian personnel system render this alternative unrealistic and not viable.</p>
<p>3) Solicitation Using Full and Open Competition. A re-procurement package has been developed and is being processed by MICC-Fort Eustis for the acquisition of a long term (up to 5 year), fully competed Facility Maintenance contract.</p>
<p>c. Justification: See paragraph 5(a), above.</p>
<p>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: This action will not require a synopsis due to the proposed contract action being made under the terms of an existing contract that was previously synopsized in sufficient detail to comply with the requirements of FAR<br />5.207 with respect to the current proposed contract action IAW FAR 5.202(a)(11).</p>
<p>7. Actions to Increase Competition: This is an interim action associated with an on-going re-procurement. It is anticipated that sources will not write to express an interest to the proposed extension.</p>
<p>8. Market Research: As a result of the short performance period of the requirement, no market research was conducted for this six month extension. Extensive market research is being conducted by the contracting officer as part of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>9. Interested Sources: N/A.</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION REVIEW DOCUMENT</p>
<p>FAR 8.405-6 LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION UNDER THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION FEDERAL SUPPLY <br />PROGRAM</p>
<p>1. Contracting Activity: Mission and Installation Contracting Command - (MICC-Ft Lee), 1830 <br />Quartermaster Road, Bldg. 7124, Ft Lee, VA 23803-1205.</p>
<p>2. Description of Action: Project Directorate (PD), Army Logistics and Technology Enterprise <br />Systems and Services (ALTESS) seeks the procurementof</p>
<p>Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Emergency Repair Services (ERS) for Trane Chillers supporting the PD ALTESS data center. PM&amp; ERS is vital to ensuring the chillers remain fully operational around-the-clock to provide cooling for vital computer equipment and facilities. An acquisition plan is not required because this procurement does not meet the threshold at Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 207.103(d)(i)(B).</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: The procurement of Preventative Maintenance (PM) &amp; Emergency Repair Services (ERS) for chillers provides around-the-clock maintenance support for Trane Chillers that support the PD ALTESS data center. Preventive Maintenance services provided by Trane ensures that all the chillers supporting the data center are properly serviced to prevent wear and tear on <br />pumps, drive belts, motors, piping, monitoring systems, software and various other keys pieces of internal equipment to maintain functionality. Emergency Repair Service provided by Trane US, Incorporated helps ensure the chillers have the necessary emergency support whether it may be during duty hours or after hours.</p>
<p>4. Authority Cited: Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41U.S.C. 251, et. Seq) and Title 40 U.S.C 501, Services for Executive Agencies, as implemented by FAR 8.405-6 and substantiated by FAR 8.405-6(a))1)(i)(B) only one source is capable of supporting this service. <br /><br /><br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: Restricting consideration to an item peculiar to one manufacturer. Restricting this procurement to Trane US, Incorporated is essential in meeting the agency's requirement and to remain compliant with the initial commercial product warranty of Trane equipment currently already in use. Trane US, Incorporated is currently the only authorized provider whom can perform the upgrade. By Trane US, <br />Incorporated performing this service, the current warranties and/or compatibility of equipment will remain unchanged and uninterrupted during services. Trane US, Incorporated has identified that they do not have any other authorized reseller or contractor that can perform these types of services.</p>
<p>6. Actions to Increase Competition: Effective Competition: In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(11), the proposed contract action is made under the terms of an existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract that was previously synopsized in sufficient detail to comply with the requirements of 5.207 with respect to the current proposed <br /><br />Control No: 12-2019-W91QF5</p>
<p>Program/Equipment: PM&amp; ERS for Chillers Est. Dollar Value:</p>
<p>contract action. Consequently, pursuant to FAR 8.404(a), orders placed against a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) are considered to be issued using full and open competition. Therefore, when placing orders under a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the FSS or synopsize the requirement. Secondly, the Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are any changes in the market place that would enable future <br />actions to be completed.</p>
<p>7. Market Research:</p>
<p>Market research, was conducted by the requiring activity during the period of 18 February 2019 through 1 March 2019, to determine the availability of preventive maintenance an emergency repair services for chillers. After further research, it was determined Trane U.S. Inc., was the only authorized service provider to support the requirement for PM &amp; ERS of Trane chillers. Trane US, Incorporated is able to provide the PM&amp; ERS for Chillers under their respective GSA FSS contract vehicle (GS-06F- 0079R).</p>
<p>Additional, market research was conducted and consisted of various searches on the internet. See market research report dated 13 September 2019 for further details.</p>

<DESC>1. Agency and Contracting Activity. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, <br />and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for an Exception to Fair <br />Opportunity."
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Systems Development Engineering and Integration (SDEI) Division is responsible for providing critical engineering support to the FEMA during disaster periods and during steady-state operations. The contractor shall provide installation services and new equipment for Enterprise voice and video services in support of all FEMA Region IV components, specifically the Regional Watch Center, and Regional Response Coordination Centers. These offices constitute the hub of region IV activities in support of all FEMA components across all regions, to include FEMA Network Operations Center and FEMA Disaster Response Support Activities.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br /><br />Pursuant to FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(B) FEMA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Order under the First Source II contract number HSHQDC-12-D-00019 to Blue Tech Inc, 4025 Hancock St. Ste 100, San Diego, CA 92110. First Source is a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract for installation services and new equipment being procured are as follows: Regional Watch Center (RWC) Refresh - Rebuild, RRCC Move - Refresh including (1) 2 - 8h x 16w (5x2 Display setup (Left Side Video Wall Five 55" top/Five 55" Below - Right Side Video Wall Five 55" top/Five 55" Below)) Video Walls on a free-standing sturdy metal structure, 2 ea. (2) CISCO VTC Package with 2 Cameras (3) Audio and Mic System (4) Devices to support 12 Displays - Zoning/Overflow (5) Devices to support content capability with HDMI to push content from 2 workstations and display VTC, Cable TV &amp; Satellite.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's need</p>
<p>Provide installation services and new equipment for Enterprise voice and video services in support of FEMA's Region IV Headquarters move to the new facility. Specifically, the Region IV Regional Watch Center, and Regional Response Coordination Center Activities. Necessary services to support the Office of the Chief Information Office's (OCIO) Systems Development Engineering and Integration (SDEI) Division's Enterprise Audio Video standards.</p>
<p>Under the new task order, Blue Tech Inc. will be required to RWC Refresh - Rebuild, RRCC Move - Refresh including (1) 2 - 8h x 16w (5x2 Display setup (Left Side Video Wall Five 55" top/Five 55" Below - Right Side Video Wall Five 55" top/Five 55" Below) Video Walls on a free-standing sturdy metal structure, 2 ea. (2) CISCO VTC Package with 2 Cameras (3) Audio and Mic System (4) Devices to support 12 Displays - Zoning/Overflow (5) Devices to support content capability with HDMI to push content from 2 workstations and display VTC, Cable TV &amp; Satellite. These services are necessary to support RWC.</p>
<p>4. Identify the exception to fair opportunity and supporting rationale, including a demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the exception cited.</p>
<p>FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C). The order must be issue on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p>
<p>Reason for Authority Cited: This task order follows an order that Blue Tech Inc. previously was competitively awarded task order HSHQDC-13-D-00019/70FA3018F00000779 on 9/29/2018, to move and modernize the Region IV Audio, Video and Visual technology to a fully operational state at the new Region IV location. All awardees were given a fair opportunity to submit a proposal to the original task order identified above. The new task order is a "logical follow-on" because another contractor could not make comparable improvements to the building/structure without first performing its own assessment, and at this stage that would result in wasteful duplication of costs, time and work already completed. The Government has a move out deadline date of December 2019 from the current building, with an option of three months on a month-to-month lease. Any further delays will result in increased lease prices if the current building is not vacated as promised, therefore the new building must be completed within the required timeline. Also, inserting another contractor at this time would require the government to perform the role as the technical integrator between two contractors to ensure continuity and smooth transition; presently, Region IV is not staffed to provide this type of service. The mitigation path is to avoid the need of the role of an integrator between disparate contractors and have one single contractor accountable to design and execute the required services.</p>
<p>Research suggests that a new fair opportunity competition task order and the potential introduction of another contractor would result in a duplication of costs, time and efforts, which is not anticipated to regain through competition. Any alternative contractor would have to perform their own assessment of the building, train their staff to the new requirement before they can begin the work, thereby further increasing the timeline for completion of the Government needs and requirements.</p>
<p>The follow-on task order will result in the continual successful operation and improvement of the Audio-visual Installation/Equipment System and meeting the Government's critical timetable.</p>
<p>5. Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer determined the price to be fair and reasonable based on the previous competitively awarded task order HSHQDC-13-D-00019/70FA3018F00000779, for the same or similar work and also a review of the GSA pricing guide.</p>
<p><br />6. Any other facts supporting the justification.<br />N/A</p>
<p>7. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the exception to fair opportunity before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.</p>
<p>Adequate competition exists, however, as this is a logical follow-on to an existing competitive order, it is more economical and practical for the Government to award to current contractor in place.</p>
<p>8. DHS intends to post this requirement on FedBizOpps pursuant to FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D).<br />N/A</p>
<p>9. Technical/Requirements Personnel Certification.</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(B)(9), I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which form a basis for the justification, are accurate and complete.</p>
<p>_______________________________ ___________<br />Technical Representative/COR Date</p>
<p>10. Contracting Officer Certification and Approval *</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(B)(8), I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief and hereby determine that the circumstances for an exception to fair opportunity exist:</p>

FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C250-19-AP-5372

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10, VA Ann Arbor Health Care System, 506-20-1-1040-0005

Description of Action: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 251 and 40 U.S.C. 501). New Requirement. 

Order against:     FSS Contract Number: V797D-30111
Name of Proposed Contractor:
Omnicell Inc.
Street Address:
590 Middlefield Rd.
City, State, Zip:
Mountain view, California 94043-4008
Phone:
800-850-6664

Description of Supplies or Services:

Fiscal year 2020 contract for Ann Arbor and Toledo CBOC for monthly lease and maintenance support services for Omnicell equipment. 
 (4) IDENTIFY THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (C) or 8.405-6(b)), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

 An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

 Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; 
 Omnicell equipment is proprietary to Omnicell, Inc. and they are the only vendor that can service their equipment. 

 In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

 Items peculiar to one manufacturer: 

 A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.) 

 These are  direct replacements  parts/components for existing equipment.  

 The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  

Omnicell equipment is proprietary to Omnicell and they have no distributors for equipment or support services. All Omnicell equipment is compatible/interoperable with existing Omnicell servers, software, hardware and vista programs at the VA. Utilization of other sources for medication dispensing cabinets at this time is not feasible as they will not integrate into our current Omnicell medication dispensing cabinet system. The current equipment on site is still in good working condition. To replace the current equipment, the server database, software and hardware throughout the hospital and CBOC would have to be replaced. It would be very costly to switch the entire system over to a new product at this time. 
(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

VIP was queried under NAICS 339112 and 324 concerns were found. A keyword search of  Omnicell  was completed and zero concerns were found. Market research was conducted on GSA Advantage and the NAC. There are two large business vendors that can provide medication management systems, Omnicell and Carefusion Solutions. It was found it would be too costly to switch over to an entirely new system at this time as we would have to also purchase a new server and equipment to have all aspect compatible with all equipment and programs currently in place at the VA. Market research showed that only Omnicell can meet the requirement. 


(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:  N/A

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:

In the future, when the current equipment is at its end of life, the market will be surveyed for new products and equipment that can meet the requirements.

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor s supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)

<div>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC)</div>
<div>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation subsection 6.303-2, the following serves as the <br />JOFOC for this acquisition.</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.</div>
<div>Agency:</div>
<div>Contracting Activity:</div>
<div>US Department of Education</div>
<div>Contracts and Acquisitions Management</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</div>
<div>The purpose of this Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) is to provide documentation that explains why this specific requirement is to be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract&nbsp; to the American&nbsp; Council&nbsp; on&nbsp; Education&nbsp; (ACE)&nbsp; without&nbsp; competition&nbsp; for the&nbsp; Education Blockchains requirement. The base pe&nbsp; i&nbsp; formance for this contract is 18 months, and the estimated total value of the contract is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the base period and includes an optional task of for an estimated total value of</div>
<div>3.&nbsp; A complete description of the supplies and/or services required to meet the agency's needs. Project Title: Education Blockchains Background</div>
<div>Federal&nbsp; statute&nbsp; directs&nbsp; the&nbsp; Office&nbsp; of&nbsp; Educational&nbsp; Technology&nbsp; (OET)&nbsp; to&nbsp; develop&nbsp; a&nbsp; <br />national vision and&nbsp; strategy&nbsp; for&nbsp; how educational&nbsp; technology&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; used&nbsp; to transform teaching and learning;&nbsp;&nbsp; promote&nbsp; awareness&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; effective&nbsp;&nbsp; use&nbsp; of&nbsp; technology&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; States,&nbsp; districts,&nbsp; and postsecondary&nbsp;&nbsp; institutions;&nbsp; ensure&nbsp; the&nbsp; availability&nbsp; and&nbsp; dissemination&nbsp; of&nbsp; knowledge;&nbsp; and promote&nbsp; the&nbsp; effective&nbsp; uses&nbsp; of&nbsp; technology&nbsp; in&nbsp; existing&nbsp; Federal&nbsp; education&nbsp; programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OET supports&nbsp; the&nbsp; President's and&nbsp; Secretary's&nbsp; priorities&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; goals of Title&nbsp; IV, Part&nbsp; A of the Elementary&nbsp; and&nbsp; Secondary&nbsp; Education&nbsp; Act&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1965&nbsp; (ESEA)&nbsp; reauthorized&nbsp; by <br />Every&nbsp; Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) by:</div>
<div>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing&nbsp; access&nbsp; to high-quality&nbsp; education&nbsp; opportunities&nbsp; for all&nbsp; learners.&nbsp; Leveraging technology&nbsp; to create equitable&nbsp; and accessible&nbsp; learning&nbsp; ecosystems&nbsp; and&nbsp; pathways&nbsp; that support everywhere, all the time learning, personalized for all students.&nbsp; This includes</div>
<div><br />leveraging&nbsp; technology&nbsp; to&nbsp; provide&nbsp; and&nbsp; demonstrate&nbsp; achievements&nbsp; from&nbsp; formal&nbsp; and informal learning experiences.</div>
<div>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supporting the use of technology to improve learning outcomes and increase flexibility Building&nbsp; capacity&nbsp; and&nbsp; providing&nbsp; technical&nbsp; assistance&nbsp; to&nbsp; State&nbsp; Educational&nbsp; Agencies (SEAs),&nbsp; Local&nbsp; Educational&nbsp; Agencies&nbsp; (LEAs),&nbsp; and&nbsp; Institutions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Higher&nbsp; Education (IHEs) to address network infrastructure and data security needs.</div>
<div>Legislative AuthorityThe Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) program, under subpart 1 of Title IV, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) reauthorized by Every Student Succeeds Act in December 2015, provides SEAs and LEAs with the flexibility to tailor investments based on <br /></div>
<div>the needs of their unique student populations.&nbsp; In addition to supporting a well-rounded education and safe and healthy schools, a portion of the SSAE program funds must&nbsp; be&nbsp; used&nbsp; for&nbsp; increasing the&nbsp; effective&nbsp; use&nbsp; of&nbsp; technology&nbsp; to&nbsp; improve&nbsp; the&nbsp; academic achievement, ac demic growth, and digital literacy of all students.&nbsp; Section 4103 (a)(3) of the ESEA authorizes the Department to reserve "two percent" of the amount appropriated for the SSAE program for "technical assistance and <br />capacity building".&nbsp; A portion of these set-aside funds&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; directed&nbsp; to the Department's&nbsp; Office&nbsp; of&nbsp; Educational&nbsp; Technology&nbsp; (OET)&nbsp; to support this activity.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Scope</div>
<div>The Education Blockchains project will build the capacity of SEAs, LEAs, IHEs, and the broad community of education&nbsp; and workforce&nbsp; stakeholders&nbsp; on the implementation of interoperable digital &nbsp; credentials&nbsp;&nbsp; anchored&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; blockchains&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; provide&nbsp;&nbsp; technical&nbsp;&nbsp; assistance&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; these stakeholders on the effective adoption ofblockchain based digital credentials infrastructure.Current educational records capture data from single institutions about the accomplishments of <br /></div>
<div>students in that institution rather than provide a comprehensive view of a students' knowledge, skills, and abilities, or their achievements apart from that single institution.&nbsp; This limits student mobility&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; ability&nbsp; for&nbsp; education&nbsp; providers&nbsp; across&nbsp; the&nbsp; education&nbsp; spectrum&nbsp; to&nbsp; provide personalized&nbsp;&nbsp; learning&nbsp; and&nbsp; timely&nbsp;&nbsp; services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developing&nbsp;&nbsp; an&nbsp;&nbsp; infrastructure that&nbsp; supports comprehensive, digital records of a students'&nbsp; accomplishments will allow the data across the student's&nbsp; lifetime&nbsp; of&nbsp; learning&nbsp; experiences&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; used&nbsp; by students&nbsp; and&nbsp; learning <br />&nbsp;providers&nbsp; to inform&nbsp; recommendations and student supports&nbsp; and enhance&nbsp; students'&nbsp; access to personalized learning and career experiences.&nbsp; Anchoring these on a blockchain can: (1) ensure that the data on&nbsp; these&nbsp; records&nbsp; is&nbsp; maintained&nbsp; securely&nbsp; and&nbsp; controlled&nbsp; by&nbsp; students&nbsp; themselves;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; record achievements&nbsp; on the level of competencies,&nbsp; and can be described and validated <br />transparently so that employers&nbsp; base&nbsp; recruiting&nbsp; on&nbsp; skills;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3) and&nbsp; overcome&nbsp; <br />institutional&nbsp; silos&nbsp; in our education&nbsp;&nbsp; system,&nbsp; allowing&nbsp;&nbsp; greater&nbsp; access&nbsp; for&nbsp; students&nbsp; to&nbsp; postsecondary&nbsp;&nbsp; education&nbsp; and employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Description of Services Required</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Blockchain technology is an emerging and rapidly evolving technology, with limited Development&nbsp; in the educational&nbsp; context.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department&nbsp; will&nbsp; provide technical&nbsp; assistance and build capacity to enable education stakeholders to effectively leverage this technology to address their academicachievement goals.&nbsp; This will require three components:&nbsp;</div>
<div>(I)&nbsp; Extensive&nbsp; stakeholder&nbsp; outreach&nbsp; to examine&nbsp; policy&nbsp; and&nbsp; technical&nbsp; elements&nbsp; related&nbsp; to education&nbsp; blockchains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; accomplished&nbsp; by&nbsp; convening&nbsp; a&nbsp; diversity&nbsp; of education&nbsp; stakeholders&nbsp; and&nbsp; forming&nbsp; working&nbsp; groups&nbsp; to&nbsp; examine&nbsp; relevant&nbsp; topics&nbsp; of interest;</div>
<div>(2)&nbsp; Primer on education blockchains that describes existing implementations of education blockchains,&nbsp; outlines&nbsp; policy&nbsp; considerations,&nbsp; and&nbsp; describes&nbsp; open&nbsp; source&nbsp; technical standards for interoperability.&nbsp; This should be developed&nbsp; as the stakeholder&nbsp; working groups surface relevant topics of interest; and</div>
<div>(3)&nbsp; Organize&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; conduct&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; compet1t1on&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; development&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; pilot&nbsp;&nbsp; sites&nbsp; for implementing&nbsp;&nbsp; education&nbsp;&nbsp; blockchains&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; allow&nbsp; mobility&nbsp; and&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; across various education domains (such as Kl2, postsecondary, workforce training, or other informal learning). Together, these three components will inform policymakers, technology developers, education practitioners, and workforce entities about effective, replicable implementations of this novel technology and promising practices for supporting low-income and traditionally underserved students.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The American Council of Education (ACE) will develop these three resources to build the capacity and provide technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, IHEs, and other stakeholders on effective use of blockchain technology as the digital infrastructure of student records.</div>
<div>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. The statutory authority permitting use of non-competitive procedures is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(l). An executive&nbsp; agency&nbsp; may&nbsp; use&nbsp; procedures&nbsp; other&nbsp; than&nbsp; competitive&nbsp; procedures&nbsp; only&nbsp; when&nbsp; the property or services needed&nbsp; by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency. The&nbsp; Federal&nbsp; Acquisition&nbsp; Regulation&nbsp; (FAR)&nbsp; citation&nbsp; permitting&nbsp; Other&nbsp; Than&nbsp; Full&nbsp; and&nbsp; Open Competition&nbsp; is FAR 6.302-1- Only one responsible&nbsp; source and no other supplies or services will <br /></div>
<div>satisfy agency requirements.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp; A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.In order to ensure timely and high-quality delivery of the three required&nbsp; components&nbsp; of this technical&nbsp; assistance&nbsp; and&nbsp; capacity&nbsp; building&nbsp; project,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Department&nbsp; of&nbsp; Education&nbsp; requires&nbsp; <br /></div>
<div>a contractor with demonstrated expertise in four key areas:</div>
<div>(1) Building&nbsp; partnerships&nbsp; with&nbsp; stakeholders&nbsp; that&nbsp; span&nbsp; multiple&nbsp; segments&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; education pipeline, including Kl2, postsecondary&nbsp; education, and workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes developing communities&nbsp; of&nbsp; action&nbsp; across&nbsp; these&nbsp; stakeholders&nbsp; to&nbsp; enable&nbsp; students&nbsp; to&nbsp; bridge&nbsp; formal&nbsp; and informal learning systems;</div>
<div>(2) Conducting policy research on topics affecting student success, especially for students that are pursuing non-traditional or informal learning experiences;</div>
<div>(3) Developing&nbsp; interoperability&nbsp; frameworks&nbsp; that&nbsp; allow&nbsp; translation&nbsp; of&nbsp; skills&nbsp; and&nbsp; academic achievements earned from a variety of sources to be aggregated&nbsp; into a comprehensive&nbsp; learner record; and</div>
<div>(4) Designing and implementing pilot projects that build capacity of education stakeholders, collecting data and conducting reviews on the outcomes of the pilot projects, and disseminating promising practices and results to the education community.The American Council on Education (ACE) is a nonprofit organization that is unique in that ACE has experience&nbsp; in each of the four key areas above as demonstrated&nbsp; through numerous prior and current projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; As discussed in further detail below (see Sections 6 and 8), other organizations have experience in one or more of the key areas, but no other organization has experience in all four.</div>
<div>While other organizations have experience working on connecting alternative credentials along&nbsp; some&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; educational&nbsp; and&nbsp; workforce&nbsp; pathway,&nbsp; no&nbsp; organization&nbsp;&nbsp; has developed a national framework that covers transitions across thousands of organizations and instituti ons.&nbsp; In addition, many organizations that support credit transfer are limited to working within one education sector, such as within K12, or within specific segments of postsecondary&nbsp; education,&nbsp; <br />such&nbsp; as&nbsp; colleges&nbsp; of&nbsp; continuing&nbsp; education&nbsp; or&nbsp; online&nbsp; learning providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACE&nbsp; has&nbsp; <br />demonstrated&nbsp; experience&nbsp; developing&nbsp; partnerships&nbsp; across&nbsp; various education and workforce sectors and creating infrastructure for lifelong learning pipelines. Finally, ACE is uniquely positioned to successfully convene a national conversation with diverse&nbsp; stakeholders&nbsp; to discuss&nbsp; policy implications&nbsp; of&nbsp; new&nbsp; technologies,&nbsp; balancing&nbsp; the impact on traditional&nbsp; institutions,&nbsp; non-traditional and&nbsp; new&nbsp; education&nbsp; providers,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the needs oflow-income and non-traditional students.&nbsp; For these reasons, a sole source contract to ACE&nbsp; is necessary&nbsp; and&nbsp; will&nbsp; lead to the&nbsp; greatest&nbsp; success&nbsp; of the Education&nbsp; Blockchainproject. Key-areas that ACE has excelled in are identified as follows:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Key Area 1;</div>
<div>ACE&nbsp; has demonstrated&nbsp; experience&nbsp; building&nbsp; partnerships&nbsp; with&nbsp; multiple&nbsp; segments&nbsp; of the education pipeline and bridging formal and informal learning for students.</div>
<div>ACE has experience across all sectors and has developed a framework adopted nationally for enabling&nbsp; transitions&nbsp; across thousands&nbsp; of organizations&nbsp; and&nbsp; institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; ACE&nbsp; is the major coordinating&nbsp; body for US colleges and universities&nbsp; and the only US organization that represents&nbsp; most students&nbsp; in all types of US accredited,&nbsp; degree-granting institutions. ACE has significant experience&nbsp; building partnerships&nbsp; with K12 educational&nbsp; entities and bridging&nbsp; K12 to <br />postsecondary&nbsp; education.&nbsp;&nbsp; From&nbsp; 2017 to 2019,&nbsp; ACE&nbsp; led the American College Access Campaign (ACAC), a national campaign to support K12 schools and first&shy; generation&nbsp; and low-income&nbsp; students in navigating&nbsp; the college application&nbsp; process.&nbsp;&nbsp; The success of this campaign&nbsp; was the result of developing&nbsp; and supporting cross-disciplinary leadership teams in all 50 states and Washington, DC.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Key Area2;ACE&nbsp; regularly&nbsp; conducts&nbsp; research&nbsp; on&nbsp; topics&nbsp; affecting&nbsp; student&nbsp; success,&nbsp; especially&nbsp; for&nbsp; non&shy; traditional students or students pursuing informal learning experience .ACE is a leading national organization for policy research on topics related to student success, institutional transformation, and modem challenges to the education system.&nbsp;&nbsp; ACE regularly convenes&nbsp; national&nbsp; and regional&nbsp; summits that bring together senior leaders&nbsp; in postsecondary education around current issues affecting student success and sharing promising practices on technology&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; policy&nbsp; innovations&nbsp; that&nbsp; impact&nbsp; success&nbsp; for&nbsp; students,&nbsp; especially&nbsp; non&shy; traditional students.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Key Area3;</div>
<div>ACE has led the development&nbsp; of frameworks&nbsp; that allow translation&nbsp; of skills and&nbsp; academic achievements earned from a variety of sources to be aggregated into a comprehensive&nbsp; learner record.</div>
<div>ACE is the only organization that has created and mediated credit transfer programs that have allowed&nbsp; individuals&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive&nbsp; academic&nbsp; credit&nbsp; for&nbsp; learning&nbsp; received&nbsp; outside&nbsp; of&nbsp; formal institutions,&nbsp; creating&nbsp; a&nbsp; bridge&nbsp; between&nbsp; formal&nbsp; and&nbsp; informal&nbsp; education&nbsp; across&nbsp; the&nbsp; lifelong learning pathway.&nbsp; Since 1974, the ACE Education College Credit Recommendation Service <br />(CREDIT)&nbsp; has&nbsp; linked&nbsp; professional&nbsp; accomplishments&nbsp; earned&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; workplace&nbsp; to&nbsp; academic credit&nbsp; at&nbsp; colleges&nbsp; and&nbsp; universities&nbsp; by&nbsp; developing&nbsp; skills&nbsp; mapping&nbsp; and&nbsp; assessments&nbsp; across multiple&nbsp; industry&nbsp; sectors&nbsp; and&nbsp; academic&nbsp; disciplines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By&nbsp; creating&nbsp; partnerships&nbsp; with&nbsp; major employers and technology companies, these credits can be issued as digital credentials that are portable&nbsp; and&nbsp; transferable&nbsp; to&nbsp; any&nbsp; institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning&nbsp; in&nbsp; 2018,&nbsp; ACE&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Lumina Foundation&nbsp; have partnered on a Working Transcript Project to further extend this service by embedding open standards and taxonomies into these digital assets so that they can be applied</div>
<div>seamlessly&nbsp; across multiple technical&nbsp; domains&nbsp; and allowing the credentials themselves to be self-sovereign and individually owned (rather than by institutions or organizations).Through partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, ACE led a national review of credentialing that led to the development of the ACE National Guide to College Credit for Workforce <br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&nbsp; Training,&nbsp;&nbsp; which&nbsp;&nbsp; contains&nbsp;&nbsp; credit&nbsp;&nbsp; recommendations&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; formal&nbsp;&nbsp; courses&nbsp;&nbsp; or <br />examinations offered by thousands of industry organizations, employers, and governments and military.&nbsp;&nbsp; This National Guide serves as the primary resource for education stakeholders for understanding&nbsp; and&nbsp; applying&nbsp; alternative&nbsp; credentials&nbsp; -&nbsp; those&nbsp; earned&nbsp; from&nbsp; informal&nbsp; and&nbsp; non&shy; accredited entities such as online learning providers or through prior learning assessments.&nbsp; To support&nbsp; this&nbsp; Guide,&nbsp; ACE&nbsp; provides&nbsp; extensive&nbsp; technical&nbsp; assistance&nbsp; for institutional&nbsp; and&nbsp; non&shy; institutional entities on applying best practices for creating more flexible pathways for <br />students to degree and credential completion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In partnership&nbsp; with the Department of Defense, ACE supports&nbsp; quality&nbsp; assurance&nbsp; frameworks&nbsp; and&nbsp; research&nbsp; on&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; validity&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; Joint Services Transcript, used across all branches of the military to translate military training and service into civilian academic and professional achievements.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Key Area 4;</div>
<div>ACE&nbsp;&nbsp; has&nbsp;&nbsp; designed&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; implemented&nbsp;&nbsp; pilot&nbsp;&nbsp; projects&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; build&nbsp;&nbsp; capacity&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />education stakeholders.In addition to the pilots mentioned above, ACE has experience developing and implementing national pilot projects that focus on innovations in credential and credit transfer, including the Alternative Credit Project, the US-Japan Collaborative Online International Leaming (COIL) project, <br /></div>
<div>the US Department of Education EQUIP Experimental&nbsp; Sites Initiative, the GED 2181 Century&nbsp; Learning&nbsp; Pathways&nbsp; Pilots (in partnership&nbsp; with&nbsp; Pearson),&nbsp; and the Effective&nbsp; College Instruction&nbsp; and&nbsp; Effective&nbsp; Teaching&nbsp; Practices&nbsp; pilot&nbsp; (in&nbsp; partnership&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Association&nbsp; of College and University Educators).</div>
<div>Making&nbsp; a noncompetitive award&nbsp; to ACE&nbsp; is the&nbsp; most&nbsp; advantageous&nbsp; acquisition&nbsp; strategy&nbsp; for meeting OETs need for a partner with unique and demonstrated&nbsp; expertise providing technical assistance and capacity building.</div>
<div>While&nbsp; other&nbsp; organizations&nbsp; reviewed&nbsp; have&nbsp; experience&nbsp; working&nbsp; on&nbsp; connecting&nbsp; alternative credentials along some portion of an educational and workforce pathway, no organization has developed a national framework that covers transitions across thousands of organizations and institutions.&nbsp; In addition, many organizations that support credit transfer are limited to working within one education sector, such as within Kl 2, or within specific segments of postsecondary education, such as colleges of continuing&nbsp; education&nbsp; or online&nbsp; learning providers.&nbsp;&nbsp; ACE has demonstrated&nbsp; experience&nbsp; developing&nbsp; partnerships&nbsp; across&nbsp; various&nbsp; education&nbsp; and&nbsp; workforce <br />sectors and creating infrastructure for lifelong learning pipelines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; ACE is uniquely positioned to successfully convene a national conversation with diverse stakeholders to discuss policy implications of new technologies, balancing the impact on traditional institutions, non&shy; traditional&nbsp; and&nbsp; new&nbsp; education&nbsp; providers,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; needs&nbsp; of&nbsp; low-income&nbsp; and&nbsp; non-traditional students.&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, a sole source contract to ACE is necessary&nbsp; and will lead to the greatest success ot&nbsp; the Education&nbsp; HJockchain&nbsp; project.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; below table indicates&nbsp; a StrengthWeakness Capability and Opportunities (SWOT) analysis of proposed sole source vendor with companies <br /></div>
<div>with either same or different capabilities.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp; A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 apples.</div>
<div>In accordance with FAR 6.305(d), this justification shall be made publicly available at the OPE (https://www.fbo.gov) and the Department&nbsp; website for 30 days within&nbsp; 14 days after contract award.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp; A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. Any rates proposed by ACE for this contract will be compared with labor rates from other contractors in the market to ensure they are fair and reasonable.&nbsp; In addition, the Independent <br /></div>
<div>Government Cost Estimate uses historical data to estimate the cost of performance and the Department will use this information in the cost analysis before award.&nbsp; The labor mix will also be confirmed as commensurate with the work required.</div>
<div>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. In&nbsp; early&nbsp; 2019,&nbsp; OET&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; market&nbsp; research&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; viable&nbsp; options&nbsp; for&nbsp; meeting&nbsp; this requirement. The research confirmed that ACE is the only vendor with the technical expertise in all <br /></div>
<div>four key areas to meet this requirement.&nbsp; This research is summarized in the table below.</div>
<div>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other fact supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</div>
<div>NIA.</div>
<div>10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. No other vendors have expressed an interest in this requirement</div>
<div>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services is made. The Department will continue to conduct thorough market research to gauge the marketplace capabilities for future requirements. CAM will follow up-with OET in advance of this contract ending to ensure that if any additional&nbsp; work is required, we have enough&nbsp; time to compete a requirement without affecting the mission of the project.&nbsp; In addition, the acquisition team has <br /></div>
<div>discussed that at the close of the contract, no further work will require the historical knowledge developed by the incumbent.&nbsp; Therefore, all future work will be competed.</div>
<div>12. The ordering activity Contracting Officer's certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's (CO) knowledge.</div>
<div>This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the CO's knowledge. The award of a sole source contract to ACE for the Education Blockchains requirement is in the best interest of the Government.</div>
