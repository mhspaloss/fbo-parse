<DESC>Introduction:
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified business sources. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services), as those domestic sources having 15 million or less annually.</p>
<p>Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />NOTE: This notice is strictly for obtaining Market Research. There will be no Question &amp; Answer period under this Sources Sought Notice.</p>
<p>Background/Mission:</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) may need support for hurricane wind field modeling activities in two topic areas: 1) NIST's recently initiated National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Technical Investigation of Hurricane Maria's impact on Puerto Rico and 2) wind field analysis for future landfalling hurricanes.</p>
<p>1. Hurricane Maria: NIST will study the impacts of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico, focusing specifically on the performance of critical buildings and their dependence on distributed infrastructure (such as electricity and water), as well as emergency communications and the public's response to those communications. Under the NCST Act, signed into law in 2002, NIST is authorized to establish teams to investigate building failures that have resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed the potential for substantial loss of life.</p>
<p>Based on a preliminary reconnaissance to Puerto Rico, the NIST Director established an NCST on February 21, 2018 to investigate the impacts of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico and to determine the:<br />&bull; characteristics of the storm hazards, including the pattern, location and cause of injuries and fatalities;<br />&bull; performance of emergency communications systems and the public's response to such communications; and<br />&bull; performance of representative critical buildings and designated safe areas in those buildings, including their dependence on infrastructure (e.g., electricity and water).<br />Additionally, the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP) was established by Congress "...to achieve major measurable reductions in the losses of life and property from windstorms through a coordinated Federal effort, in cooperation with other levels of government, academia, and the private sector, aimed at improving the understanding of windstorms and their impacts and developing and encouraging the implementation of cost-effective mitigation measures to reduce those impacts."</p>
<p><br />Additional background information on NIST's planned efforts on Hurricane Maria is available at:<br />https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/05/nist-launches-study-hurricane-marias-impact-puerto-rico. <br />Anticipated wind field characterization activities are described in a presentation at:<br />https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2018/05/17/02_ncstac_preliminary_project_plan_for_characterization_of_hazards.pdf.</p>
<p>2. Future Landfalling Hurricanes: Under mission assignments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) during the fall of 2017, NIST was tasked to develop estimates of the surface wind speeds immediately following landfall for Hurricanes Irma, Maria and Nate, to support FEMA's assessment of storm impacts through the Hazus Hurricane Model (https://www.fema.gov/hazus-mh-hurricane-wind-model). NIST distributed maps of peak wind speeds to support post-storm investigations (available at https://www.designsafe-ci.org/recon-portal/).</p>
<p><br />Scope of Requirements:</p>
<p>1. Hurricane Maria: As part of the NCST Technical Investigation, NIST is seeking wind data analysis and hurricane wind field modeling to reconstruct the surface level winds in Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria, including consideration of topographic effects. NIST may also need a probabilistic wind hazard analysis to evaluate the influence of topographic effects on design wind speeds in ASCE 7-16.</p>
<p>2. Future Landfalling Hurricanes: Under NWIRP, NIST is seeking rapid response capability for wind field modeling for future landfalling hurricanes in the U.S., to support impact estimates using Hazus and/or NIST coordination of post-storm investigations. The scope of this task includes acquisition of data from surface level observations of wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric pressure in landfalling tropical cyclones, and production of hurricane wind field models and maps.</p>
<p><br />Specific Requirements:</p>
<p>1. Hurricane Maria: The goal of this requirement is for the Contractor to conduct wind data analysis and hurricane wind field modeling to reconstruct the surface level winds in Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria.</p>
<p>Activities include but are not limited to:<br />a. Acquiring surface level observations of wind speed (gust and mean), wind direction, and atmospheric pressure across Puerto Rico, from federal, state and other meteorological stations and mesonets. Converting observations into equivalent 3 second peak gusts at 10 m height over open terrain.<br />b. Using a validated hurricane wind field model consistent with that used in development of the design wind speed maps for Puerto Rico in ASCE 7-16 (as described in the Commentary to ASCE 7-16 Chapter 26 and referenced publications) and adjusting the parameters of the model to obtain the best fit to observed wind speed, direction and atmospheric pressure data from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Developing maps of peak gust wind speeds, delivering as shape files and in PDF format, and delivering modeled time histories of wind speed and direction at gridded locations across the impacted region.<br />c. Incorporating topographic corrections into the hurricane model, developed either from wind tunnel model data provided by NIST (if available), or empirically using research from the technical literature if wind tunnel data is not available, or through a combination of the two approaches if wind tunnel data is available for only a portion of the Commonwealth.<br />d. Developing a formal process for optimizing the fit of the hurricane model to the observed wind field data - based on experimental design techniques and statistical assessment of goodness-of-fit, including quantification of uncertainty.<br />e. Reanalyzing the Hurricane Maria wind field (1b), incorporating the topographic corrections (1c) and optimized fitting process (1d).</p>
<p>Because the results of activities (1a) and (1b) are critical for planning of the NCST investigation, the Contractor would need to be capable of completing these activities within two weeks of award of a contract.</p>
<p>Additional activities related to the goals above may include performing a probabilistic wind hazard analysis to evaluate the influence of topographic effects on design wind speeds in ASCE 7-16, using Monte Carlo simulation consistent with the procedures used to develop the design wind speed maps in ASCE 7-16 (as described in the Commentary to ASCE 7-16 Chapter 26 and referenced publications).</p>
<p>2. Future Landfalling Hurricanes. The goal of this requirement is for the Contractor to develop wind field models for landfalling tropical cyclones using a validated hurricane model consistent with that embedded in Hazus - as described in the Hazus Technical Manuals (https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/24609) and referenced publications - and fitted to observed meteorological data. The general methodology as applied to 2017 Hurricane Harvey is described in the file named "Hurricane Harvey Preliminary Wind Field Analysis-VERSION 2.pdf" available at https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.community//Hurricane%20Harvey%20Resources.</p>
<p>Activities may include but are not limited to:<br />a. Acquiring surface level observations of wind speed (gust and mean), wind direction, and atmospheric pressure in the impacted areas of the U.S, including coastal regions, from federal, state and other meteorological stations, mesonets, and mobile observation assets. <br />b. Develop local corrections to convert observations into equivalent 3 second peak gusts at 10 m height over open terrain.<br />c. Developing peak gust wind field models at Day 1, Day 3, and Day 7 after landfall as track files suitable for direct ingestion in the Hazus Hurricane Model, optimizing the fit of modeled to observed data.<br />d. Along with each wind field model above, delivering comparisons of modeled and observed wind speed, direction, and atmospheric pressure time histories at each station. <br />e. Developing maps of peak gust wind speeds and delivering as shape files and in PDF format, and delivering modeled time histories of wind speed and direction at gridded locations across the impacted region.<br />f. Participating in daily (including evenings and weekends) modeling coordination calls to provide updates on data acquisition and modeling progress.<br />g. Developing a summary report documenting the data sources and conversions to standard conditions, the final wind field model, and the fit of modeled to observed data.<br />The typical period of performance for a hurricane wind field model task will be two weeks, beginning on the day of landfall. The first wind field model will be due the day following landfall (Day 1, as in 3b).</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified business sources. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541330 (Engineering Services), as those domestic sources having annual revenue of $15 million or less.</p>
<p>Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />NOTE: This notice is strictly for obtaining Market Research. There will be no Question &amp; Answer period under this Sources Sought Notice.</p>
<p>Background/Mission:</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will study the impacts of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico, focusing specifically on the performance of critical buildings and their dependence on distributed infrastructure (such as electricity and water), as well as emergency communications and the public's response to those communications. Under the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Act, signed into law in 2002, NIST is authorized to establish teams to investigate building failures that have resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed the potential for substantial loss of life.</p>
<p>Based on a preliminary reconnaissance to Puerto Rico in December 2017, the NIST Director authorized the NCST investigation to determine:<br />&bull; the characteristics of the storm hazards-the pattern, location and cause of injuries and fatalities;<br />&bull; the performance of emergency communications systems and the public's response to such communications; and<br />&bull; the performance of representative critical buildings and designated safe areas in those buildings, including their dependence on infrastructure such as electricity and water.</p>
<p>Scope of Requirement:</p>
<p>NIST is seeking information from all sources capable of providing engineering services to support the NCST study of Hurricane Maria's impact on Puerto Rico. The principle goal of this requirement is for the Contractor to document the performance of selected hospitals, schools, and storm shelters in Hurricane Maria.<br />Specific Requirements:</p>
<p>One goal of this requirement is for the Contractor to document the performance during Hurricane Maria for a sample of 40-100 selected buildings in Puerto Rico, to include hospitals, schools, and storm shelters. The goal is to document conditions in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Recognizing that post-storm repairs will have already taken place, this will not be limited to simply documenting the current building conditions but will require technical discussions with relevant building personnel to document all damage caused by the storm. Activities related to this goal include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Documenting damage to buildings caused by Hurricane Maria, including failures of structural systems, building envelopes, and rooftop equipment, and the resulting damage to interior building components, as well as geotechnical failures that affected buildings (e.g., slope failure and associated debris impact). Required information is similar to that included on the ATC-45 detailed evaluation form: https://www.atcouncil.org/pdfs/ATC45Detail.pdf. However, as noted above, the requirement is to document damage in the immediate aftermath of the storm, prior to any repairs that may have already taken place.<br />2. Conducting technical discussions with relevant building personnel and obtaining photographs, inspection reports, and other information to provide evidence of building damage as listed in item a.<br />3. Performing inspections and taking photographs as required to provide evidence of building damage as listed in item a.<br />4. Documenting significant sources of water intrusion that contributed to interior damage (e.g., blow-off or punctures of roof membranes; dislodgment of rooftop equipment; debris-impact damage to windows, doors, or walls; or wind-driven rain penetration through damaged seals of windows and doors, or through joints in walls)<br />5. Documenting damage to building-located communication towers, other wireless communication equipment, and infrastructure connections, including electrical and water connections <br />6. Documenting any loss of function for the building (or portions thereof) along with the associated factors that contributed to the loss of function (e.g., structural damage, water damage, flooding, or loss of utilities such as electricity or water)<br />7. Obtaining information related to insurance and public assistance claims and submissions, including documentation of damages<br />8. Documenting operational conditions of buildings that were occupied during the storm (e.g., Which areas were used for sheltering? Were any hazards encountered by sheltering occupants, such as collapse, debris penetration, or flooding? Did any injuries or fatalities occur in the shelter?)</p>
<p>Another goal of this requirement is for the Contractor to obtain additional documents, records, and information related to the design, construction, maintenance, and operation for a smaller sample of up to 40 selected buildings in Puerto Rico, to include hospitals, schools, and storm shelters. Activities related to this goal may include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>9. Documenting the history of applicable code(s) and standards for hospitals, schools, and storm shelters in selected municipalities of Puerto Rico, along with relevant information on code enforcement and compliance<br />10. Obtaining design documents, including design drawings and calculations<br />11. Documenting the architectural intent for selected buildings, in particular, whether usage as a storm shelter was considered in the design<br />12. Documenting as-built conditions<br />13. Obtaining construction-related records such as building permits and building inspection reports<br />14. Documenting relevant pre-storm building maintenance, repair, and operational activities that may have affected the building performance during Hurricane Maria (e.g., roof replacement or repair; installation of hurricane-resistant windows, doors, or shutters; anchorage of rooftop equipment; maintenance of roof drains)</p>
<p>Additional activities related to the two goals above may include:</p>
<p>15. Coordinating with the NIST team to perform inspections jointly for a subset of the selected buildings<br />16. Developing and disseminating outreach methods (documents, letters, emails, phone calls, etc.) to aid in collection of information<br />17. Developing protocols and conducting training for all staff involved with collecting information and inspecting buildings <br />18. Conducting meetings and discussions in fluent Spanish<br />19. Coordinating meetings of the NIST team with relevant personnel in Puerto Rico and providing oral English-Spanish translation services for these meetings<br />20. Performing cross-cultural and conceptual English-Spanish translation of documents (with less reliance on linguistic/literal equivalence)<br />21. Performing cross-cultural and conceptual Spanish-English translation of information and reports provided to NIST (with less reliance on linguistic/literal equivalence)<br />22. Creating and implementing innovative ways to identify people who might have relevant photographs, video footage, or other documentation on the performance of the selected buildings during Hurricane Maria, including documentation of damage that has since been repaired<br />23. Obtaining aerial photographs of selected buildings using a drone, and assembling 3D models of the buildings from the aerial images<br />24. Where available, and when requested by NIST, obtaining samples of materials and transmitting these samples to NIST for potential materials testing (NIST has interest in cases where environmental degradation, such as corrosion of metals or UV degradation of polymeric materials, may have contributed to failures)<br />25. Partnering with or collaborating with local (Puerto Rican) experts in healthcare, education, disaster recovery, and other relevant organizations</p>
<p>The selected Contractor must be able to provide engineering services using both English and Spanish (written and oral). A physical presence in Puerto Rico is essential to provide these engineering services.
