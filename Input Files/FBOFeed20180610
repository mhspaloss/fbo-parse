<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is HAAF175AML0044 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-98. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is  0 with a small business size standard of 0.00 employees. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids.

FOB Destination shall be Savannah, GA 31409<BR><BR>The MICC End User requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Micro Trauma Kit NOW! (NT-TKN-EMPTY-003-MC) 
-Belt Mount, Multicam, w/ no contents.
It is designed to hold essential lifesaving medical supplies on a belt.   

The Micro TKN was designed as an EDC trauma kit for law enforcement professionals, prepared citizens, or hunters.  Deployment of critical first aid supplies can be done with one hand or a single finger from either the left or right side by pulling the BLIP featured pull tabs.  The Micro TKN consists of two main components – the outer MOLLE or Belt mounted pouch utilizing the Ten-Speed technology, and a removable insert that keeps medical supplies organized. 

The front outer pouch features a laser cut cross with several signal indicators - black insert, red, or highly reflective glow-in-the-dark insert.  The end user can decide which indicator works best for their use or leave all the inserts out for a pattern matched front for maximum concealability.
Our Ball Loaded Index Point, or BLIP™ for short, is a feature found on all our lidded pouches and select plate carriers like the Micro Trauma Kit NOW! Belt Pouch. BLIP was born in the freezing rain on a Blackwater range. It was there we realized that when you can’t feel your fingers, it’s very difficult to get a grasp on a flat piece of webbing and distinguish a pull tab. The ball doesn’t rely on friction; the bones in your fingers positively engage it. BLIP’s form is both easy to pull and impossible to miss.

Product must be compatible with OPSCORE FAST HELMET
A revolutionary suspension system that combines a one-piece full coverage impact layer with modular, breathable comfort pads that can be customized and repositioned for comfort without affecting impact performance.
Designed for comfort during extended use.
Designed for shockwave attenuation.
Worm-Dial retention system provides a quick adjustment in a low profile fitband.
Pads are durable, breathable and low absorbency. 
Easy battlefield replacement.
Seamlessly integrates with all Ops-Core FAST and Sentry Helmets.
The LUX Liner is a revolutionary suspension system that combines a one-piece full coverage impact layer with modular, breathable comfort pads that can be customized and repositioned for comfort without affecting impact performance.  It retrofits the Ops Core FAST Ballistic High Cut and Maritime Helmets and is available in two variations: with a low profile Worm-Dial fitband, or with H-Nape Head-Loc chinstrap.  Both systems utilize the same impact layer.  The LUX Liner is easy to install into FAST Ballistic Helmets using the existing Velcro pattern in the shells, and comes in all available sizes.
Ops Core LUX Liners are impact tested according to U.S. Army ACH Specification (CO/PD-05-04:2007).  The permanent full coverage impact layer is designed for shockwave attenuation while the durable, breathable, low-absorbancy pads provide a giant leap forward in overall comfort to the operator.  The pad system is composed of many individual pads that can be fully customized to the wearer’s needs.  Pads can be added or removed as needed to accommodate electronic headsets.
This version of the LUX Liner features Ops Core’s innovative low-profile Worm Dial Fitband.  Like their OCC Dial, the Worm Dial allows operators an increased level of adjustment and customization in fit to help stabilize the weight of heavier night vision goggles.  The adjustable fitband circles the head of the wearer, behind the comfort pads, and can be tightened or loosened by adjusting the Worm Dial.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
