By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign or comply with internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or contactors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (NOV 2012)</p>
<p><br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, AFICA/KG Col Fiona A Christianson, 66 Kennedy Avenue, Barksdale AFB, LA 71110, Phone: (318) 456-6336, email: ig.afica_kg.workflow@us.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>5352.242-9000 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (NOV 2012)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes, if required, for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.<br />(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or Security Forces for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and [insert any additional requirements to comply with local security procedures] to obtain a vehicle pass.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site. <br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with [insert any additional requirements to comply with AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management] citing the appropriate paragraphs as applicable.<br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/.<BR><BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause –
Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item –
(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is –
(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101);
(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without
modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and
(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C.
App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.
Component means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.
Cost of components means –
(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation
costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a
domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or
(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of
the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus
allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs
associated with the manufacture of the end product.
Domestic end product means –
(1) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States;
(2) An end product manufactured in the United States, if –
(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States

(b) The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) provides a preference for domestic end products for
supplies acquired for use in the United States. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, the component test of
the Buy American Act is waived for an end product that is a COTS item (See 12.505(a)(1)).
(c) Offerors may obtain from the Contracting Officer a list of foreign articles that the Contracting
Officer will treat as domestic for this contract.
(d) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products except to the extent that it specified

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.
