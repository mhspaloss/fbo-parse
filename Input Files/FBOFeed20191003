In accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1, the FAA is conducting a market survey to determine the capabilities of the market to fulfill the requirements for network printers and consumables. 

The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined at this time. We DO NOT have an anticipated release date for a SIR. Depending on the results of this market survey, the FAA may decide to conduct an unrestricted competition or set aside the procurement for small business concerns, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or eligible Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB) 8(a) certified vendors.

Attachment 0001, Market Survey Questions, is included as part of this market survey. All interested vendors are instructed to review the attachment, and respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities.

<DESC><div>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Supra Thermal Ion Sensor (STIS) for the Space Weather Follow On (SWFO - L1) Mission. The SWFO - L1 Mission is a high priority joint undertaking by NASA and the Department of the Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The SWFO - L1 Observatory will provide NOAA with the continuity of solar wind data and coronal mass ejection (CME) imagery, which is the National Weather Service&rsquo;s highest priority for space weather observations. The STIS instrument will be part of the SWFO - L1 satellite. The instrument will measure the ion flux population with or without mass discrimination as a function of energy.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div>STIS is an ion spectrometer device that measures ions across a broad range of energies to characterize solar ejecta including Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) and interplanetary shocks. In particular, STIS is a low energy charged particle detector that is capable of measuring the ion flux population as a function of energy. This ion population with energies higher than that of the bulk plasma are produced by local solar acceleration as well as acceleration from a CME shock front. Analysis of these spectra can aid in estimating the arrival time and strength of CMEs shocks.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>It is anticipated that the STIS contract will include the delivery of one (1) flight model (FM) instrument and one (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU), flight harness(es) between instrument boxes, if applicable, and enough spares and built-up sub-assemblies for one additional FM.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The scope of work will include all tasks necessary to design, analyze, develop, fabricate, integrate, test, calibrate, evaluate and support launch and on-orbit check-out of the STIS instrument; supply and maintain the instrument Ground Support Equipment (GSE), and support the Mission Operations Center (MOC) through mission hand over to NOAA.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Competitive procedures will be used to fulfill this requirement, providing full and open competition. The anticipated small business goals for this procurement are as follows: Total Small Business Goal 6%; Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDB) 1.5%; Women Owned Small Business Concerns (WOSB) 1%; Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities 0.5%; HUBZone Small Business Concerns 0.5%; Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns (VOSB) 1.5%; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern 0.5%; Other 0.5%.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The resulting contract type is anticipated to be Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee,&nbsp;with incentives for cost and schedule.&nbsp;</div>

<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to notify potential offerors of an FFP/IDIQ for Vertical Transportation Equipment Maintenance and Repair at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, VA; JEB Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, VA; and Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, VA and at sites located within a 50-mile radius of the listed sites.

The work includes but is not limited to: providing procedural compliance, work conformance
to established standards, suitability/completeness of required documentation and provided data, scheduling of preventative maintenance and recurring work, timeliness of work completed based on contractual requirements, communication, effectiveness of quality assurance, and overall quality of the services provided at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, VA; JEB Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, VA; and Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, VA and at sites located within a 50-mile radius of the listed sites.

The work identified is to be provided by means of a combination Firm-Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity type of contract.
  Source Selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that provides the lowest price and is technically acceptable to the Government. Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Method.  In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology:  Proposals will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest priced to highest price).  The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the lowest priced proposal.  The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  However, if the lowest priced proposal is not found to be technically acceptable, the Navy, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to increase the number of proposals it will review, until the Government identifies a technically acceptable proposal.
 Accordingly, under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both technical and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.  Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss or revise their proposals.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both non-price and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.

The solicitation and resulting contract award will be a performance-based service acquisition made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposals (RFP), will be advantageous to the Government price and other evaluation factors considered.
 The offerors proposal shall contain a response to each of the evaluation factors and shall be in the form prescribed by the solicitation. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors:  Factor 1  Technical Approach/Management, Factor 2  Corporate Experience, Factor 3  Safety and Factor 4  Past Performance.  NOTE:  Offerors MUST be evaluated as technically ACCEPTABLE under factors 1, 2, 3 and 4 in order to be considered technically acceptable overall.

Factor 2 Corporate Experience and Factor 4 Past Performance:  The Offeror shall submit projects that are similar in size, scope and complexity to the solicitation.  

Size:  A maintenance service contract with a yearly value of at least $255K or greater for recurring services.
 Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery values for infrequent work will not be considered similar in size.

Scope: Demonstrate the ability to provide maintenance and repair services of Vertical Transportation Equipment to include escalators and elevators. Vertical Transportation Equipment Maintenance shall include maintenance, repair, and alteration of installed equipment and systems; to include preventative maintenance, inspection, testing, certification and trouble call work

Complexity: Demonstrate the ability to respond simultaneously to service calls (routine, urgent, and emergency) and maintenance requirements for repair, alteration, and minor construction at various locations and buildings throughout the installation and supporting annexes.

Demonstrate the ability to manage competing priorities in order to support customer demands.

Offers shall be submitted for the performance of work for a period of one year.
 However, the initial term of the contract may be for a period of less than one year.  The Government has the option to extend the term of the contract services for additional periods of one to twelve months.  The contract will be for a base period with four (4) one-year option periods, which, cumulatively, will not exceed sixty (60) months.

**NON-MANUFACTURING RULE (NMR)**

The requirement that a Non-Manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R.  121.406].  In order to qualify as a small business concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R.  125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States.

ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as set-aside for SDVOSB.  The applicable NAICS code is 334510.  The solicitation will be issued on or about October 4, 2019 for approximately ten (10) business days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety. In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at james.carson2@va.gov AND sandra.johnson3@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>ERP Questionnaire
<p>ENHANCED ROBOTIC PAYLOADS (ERP) - UNMANNED GROUND SYSTEMS (UGS) <br />Pan Tilt Imaging<br />SOURCES SOUGHT</p>
<p>Attached is the U.S. Army Sources Sought Questionnaire related to potential new procurement of the Enhanced Robotic Payloads (ERP) - Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) Pan Tilt Imagers (PTI) technologies. The paragraphs below contain additional information regarding the questionnaire and its subject. If you need further communications with the Army concerning this questionnaire, you may contact Brian Graham from PdM UGV at brian.l.graham.civ@mail.mil. In addition to this questionnaire Government representatives from Product Manager Unmanned Ground Vehicles (PdM UGV) will be at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Conference in Washington DC from 14-16 October, 2019 to also gather information to inform Acquisition Strategies. You may contact Louis Anulare from PdM UGV at louis.a.anulare.civ@mail.mil to schedule a brief meeting. We thank you in advance for your time and participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire.</p>
<p>Background: In order to inform the development of an acquisition strategy, cost estimate, cost benefit analysis, technical risk assessment, and performance specification, Product Manager Unmanned Ground Vehicles (PdM UGV) seeks to characterize the state of the market for ERP-UGS; a suite of modular capabilities designed with open architecture to provide and increased level of standoff, situational awareness, disruption capability and dexterity to respond to current and emergent Engineer, Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) requirements. These multiple, modular robotic mission payloads will use open architecture to integrate with the Man Transportable Robotic System Increment II (MTRS Inc. II), Common Robotic System - Heavy (CRS-H) and other future platforms to form the Army's next generation platform adaptable robotics systems.</p>
<p>While a full set of requirements is not yet available, the ERP will: 1) Enhance an EOD Teams ability to detect, identify, locate, evaluate, render safe, exploit, and dispose of all Explosive Ordnance (EO), to include Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) at sufficient standoff to improve Soldier survivability and increase mission success. 2) Provide Soldiers the ability to increase operational range between the Operator and the hazard as well as provide the ability to detect, identify, and locate the hazard and transmit that data for use by follow-on site entry teams. ERP will enable CBRN Soldiers to perform site initial entry via unmanned operation thereby reducing Soldier exposure to unknown hazards, and enhancing the Combatant Commander's decision making process. 3) Consist of three capabilities that will mount on existing and programmed Host Unmanned Ground Vehicles (HUGVs) in EOD units: (a) Increased ability to detect hidden or camouflaged EO through advanced imaging, (b) Limit Soldier cognitive burden through autonomous Obstacle Avoidance and Digital Modeling (OA&amp;DM), and (c) Provides dynamic networking for Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) operation and 360 degree ISR capability.</p>
<p>This market survey will focus on the ERP-UGS Pan Tilt Imager technologies ONLY. Separate market surveys will be conducted to assess the other desired ERP capabilities.</p>
<p>I. Objectives<br />a. This Sources Sought Questionnaire supports Market Research that will be conducted by the U.S. Army to better understand the availability and capabilities of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) or other qualified equipment sources to provide ERP capabilities. The information gathered by the Army through this questionnaire, along with other market investigation data, is solely intended for use by the U.S. Army and will not be shared amongst competing companies. For instructions and more information regarding proprietary information, please refer to Section IV of this document. Participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire by the various contractors is considered low risk to the commercial companies, as responses will be treated per Section IV as Proprietary.</p>
<p>b. Participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire provides an important opportunity to influence the solicitation provision and contract clauses, budget requests, and a full range of other elements that supports the acquisition strategy for the Army procurement programs. The U.S. Army will not provide compensation for any resources spent answering this QUESTIONNAIRE and participation is at the discretion of the equipment manufacturer respondent(s).</p>
<p>II. Instructions<br />a. Read the capability summary for this effort in Section III of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Responses to this survey should be provided within 10 calendar days of posting to the point of contact on the www.fedbizopps.gov posting.</p>
<p>b. Answer all of the questions in the QUESTIONNAIRE as concisely as possible. Due to the magnitude of questions being answered, it is imperative that only what is asked in the questions is part of you answer, please see letter (d) below for submission of additional information. If certain U.S. Army capabilities shown in this QUESTIONNAIRE are deemed not available, or not achievable according to the respondent's company knowledge, please include a concise alternate proposal(s) which would be intended to provide the intent of the capability described therein. It is the U.S. Army's desire to avoid "not applicable" (N/A) type answers.</p>
<p>c. Please provide the projected development resources such as cost and timing to support the survey's objectives. This information is essential in understanding the scope of the project and it is understood by the U.S. Army that this information is strictly a rough estimate. The respondent's company is not contractually obligated to this information. Please avoid N/A, not applicable or blank information. The U.S. Army recognizes these are rough estimates and will use the information strictly as a means for gaining general knowledge. Please include development resource cost and timing estimates for all alternate proposals as well as the mainstream proposal.</p>
<p>d. You may provide product brochures or other forms of information relevant to this QUESTIONNAIRE as is deemed appropriate within a separate attachment to your response, please entitle it "Additional Information". Additionally, it is encouraged to provide any additional information that enables the U.S. Army to gain insight into the company, product performance, reliability and warranty performance.</p>
<p>III. Summary for the ERP-UGS Sources Sought Questionnaire<br />This questionnaire applies to the U.S. Army's emerging requirement for plans to procure a set of capabilities that meets the operational requirements developed by the TRADOC Capability Manager for EOD (TCM-EOD) and CBRNE Capability Developers (MSCOE / Capability Development Integration Directorate (CDID)/ Requirements Determination Division (RDD)). The Army intends to develop a performance specification reflecting TCM-EOD/CBRNE's operational requirements and informed by the performance, cost, availability, and supportability of systems in the commercial market. In order to ensure the best value to the U.S. Army and taxpayers, we are surveying the market place to determine if ERP capabilities could be procured competitively.</p>
<p><br />IV. Proprietary<br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this QUESTIONNAIRE. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. (To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY.") Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e. g. trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the QUESTIONNAIRE and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with an explanatory text so the U.S. Government is clearly notified of the data needing to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or other appropriate means to indicate the portion of a single page to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data which is already in the public domain or in possession of the U.S. Government or 3rd parties, or is afterward placed into public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once it is in the public domain. Data which is already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text on both the cover of the transmittal email and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses which contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of the data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>
<p>7. The U.S. Government will not publish the results of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Respondents WILL NOT be notified regarding information obtained related to this QUESTIONNAIRE. If and when a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the respondent's responsibility to monitor these sites for the releases of any synopsis or solicitation.</p>

<p>7. The U.S. Government will not publish the results of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Respondents WILL NOT be notified regarding information obtained related to this QUESTIONNAIRE. If and when a solicitation is issued, it may be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the respondent's responsibility to monitor these sites for the releases of any synopsis or solicitation.</p>

<DESC>ERP Questionnaire
<p>ENHANCED ROBOTIC PAYLOADS (ERP) - UNMANNED GROUND SYSTEMS (UGS) <br />Obstacle Avoidance and Digital Modeling<br />SOURCES SOUGHT</p>
<p>Attached is the U.S. Army Sources Sought Questionnaire related to potential new procurement of the Enhanced Robotic Payloads (ERP) - Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) Obstacle Avoidance and Digital Modeling (OA&amp;DM) technologies. The paragraphs below contain additional information regarding the questionnaire and its subject. If you need further communications with the Army concerning this questionnaire, you may contact Brian Graham from PdM UGV at brian.l.graham.civ@mail.mil. In addition to this questionnaire Government representatives from Product Manager Unmanned Ground Vehicles (PdM UGV) will be at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Conference in Washington DC from 14-16 October, 2019 to also gather information to inform Acquisition Strategies. You may contact Louis Anulare from PdM UGV at louis.a.anulare.civ@mail.mil to schedule a brief meeting. We thank you in advance for your time and participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire.</p>
<p>Background: In order to inform the development of an acquisition strategy, cost estimate, cost benefit analysis, technical risk assessment, and performance specification, Product Manager Unmanned Ground Vehicles (PdM UGV) seeks to characterize the state of the market for ERP-UGS; a suite of modular capabilities designed with open architecture to provide and increased level of standoff, situational awareness, disruption capability and dexterity to respond to current and emergent Engineer, Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) requirements. These multiple, modular robotic mission payloads will use open architecture to integrate with the Man Transportable Robotic System Increment II (MTRS Inc. II), Common Robotic System - Heavy (CRS-H) and other future platforms to form the Army's next generation platform adaptable robotics systems.</p>
<p>While a full set of requirements is not yet available, the ERP will: 1) Enhance an EOD Teams ability to detect, identify, locate, evaluate, render safe, exploit, and dispose of all Explosive Ordnance (EO), to include Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) at sufficient standoff to improve Soldier survivability and increase mission success. 2) Provide Soldiers the ability to increase operational range between the Operator and the hazard as well as provide the ability to detect, identify, and locate the hazard and transmit that data for use by follow-on site entry teams. ERP will enable CBRN Soldiers to perform site initial entry via unmanned operation thereby reducing Soldier exposure to unknown hazards, and enhancing the Combatant Commander's decision making process. 3) Consist of three capabilities that will mount on existing and programmed Host Unmanned Ground Vehicles (HUGVs) in EOD units: (a) Increased ability to detect hidden or camouflaged EO through advanced imaging, (b) Limit Soldier cognitive burden through autonomous Obstacle Avoidance and Digital Modeling (OA&amp;DM), and (c) Provides dynamic networking for Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) operation and 360 degree ISR capability.</p>
<p>This market survey will focus on the ERP-UGS Obstacle Avoidance and Digital Modeling technologies ONLY. Separate market surveys will be conducted to assess the other desired ERP capabilities.</p>
<p>I. Objectives<br />a. This Sources Sought Questionnaire supports Market Research that will be conducted by the U.S. Army to better understand the availability and capabilities of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) or other qualified equipment sources to provide ERP capabilities. The information gathered by the Army through this questionnaire, along with other market investigation data, is solely intended for use by the U.S. Army and will not be shared amongst competing companies. For instructions and more information regarding proprietary information, please refer to Section IV of this document. Participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire by the various contractors is considered low risk to the commercial companies, as responses will be treated per Section IV as Proprietary.</p>
<p>b. Participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire provides an important opportunity to influence the solicitation provision and contract clauses, budget requests, and a full range of other elements that supports the acquisition strategy for the Army procurement programs. The U.S. Army will not provide compensation for any resources spent answering this QUESTIONNAIRE and participation is at the discretion of the equipment manufacturer respondent(s).</p>
<p>II. Instructions<br />a. Read the capability summary for this effort in Section III of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Responses to this survey should be provided within 10 calendar days of posting to the point of contact on the www.fedbizopps.gov posting.</p>
<p>b. Answer all of the questions in the QUESTIONNAIRE as concisely as possible. Due to the magnitude of questions being answered, it is imperative that only what is asked in the questions is part of you answer, please see letter (d) below for submission of additional information. If certain U.S. Army capabilities shown in this QUESTIONNAIRE are deemed not available, or not achievable according to the respondent's company knowledge, please include a concise alternate proposal(s) which would be intended to provide the intent of the capability described therein. It is the U.S. Army's desire to avoid "not applicable" (N/A) type answers.</p>
<p>c. Please provide the projected development resources such as cost and timing to support the survey's objectives. This information is essential in understanding the scope of the project and it is understood by the U.S. Army that this information is strictly a rough estimate. The respondent's company is not contractually obligated to this information. Please avoid N/A, not applicable or blank information. The U.S. Army recognizes these are rough estimates and will use the information strictly as a means for gaining general knowledge. Please include development resource cost and timing estimates for all alternate proposals as well as the mainstream proposal.</p>
<p>d. You may provide product brochures or other forms of information relevant to this QUESTIONNAIRE as is deemed appropriate within a separate attachment to your response, please entitle it "Additional Information". Additionally, it is encouraged to provide any additional information that enables the U.S. Army to gain insight into the company, product performance, reliability and warranty performance.</p>
<p>III. Summary for the ERP-UGS Sources Sought Questionnaire<br />This questionnaire applies to the U.S. Army's emerging requirement for plans to procure a set of capabilities that meets the operational requirements developed by the TRADOC Capability Manager for EOD (TCM-EOD) and CBRNE Capability Developers (MSCOE / Capability Development Integration Directorate (CDID)/ Requirements Determination Division (RDD)). The Army intends to develop a performance specification reflecting TCM-EOD/CBRNE's operational requirements and informed by the performance, cost, availability, and supportability of systems in the commercial market. In order to ensure the best value to the U.S. Army and taxpayers, we are surveying the market place to determine if ERP capabilities could be procured competitively.</p>
<p><br />IV. Proprietary<br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this QUESTIONNAIRE. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. (To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY.") Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e. g. trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the QUESTIONNAIRE and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with an explanatory text so the U.S. Government is clearly notified of the data needing to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or other appropriate means to indicate the portion of a single page to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data which is already in the public domain or in possession of the U.S. Government or 3rd parties, or is afterward placed into public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once it is in the public domain. Data which is already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text on both the cover of the transmittal email and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses which contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of the data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>
<p>7. The U.S. Government will not publish the results of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Respondents WILL NOT be notified regarding information obtained related to this QUESTIONNAIRE. If and when a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the respondent's responsibility to monitor these sites for the releases of any synopsis or solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for: Various Chrome Plating Tooling for Watervliet Arsenal Chrome Plating Facility.
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC-WRN) WVA Contracting Office located at Watervliet Arsenal (WVA) is issuing this sources sought synopsis to notify any interested parties the Government is considering the purchase of existing various chrome plating tooling currently used in the production of chrome plated cannon barrels at the Watervliet Arsenal.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE. This is a request for information on capabilities and interest and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP); submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary and the U.S. Government (USG) assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.</p>
<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION:<br />Hartchrom Inc. located at Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, NY has a production contract to chrome plate various cannon barrels and minor plating using the Government owned chrome plating facility at WVA. WVA does not intend to seek a follow-on contract for chrome plating services of Watervliet Arsenal cannon barrels and associated materiel. The Government has decided to return to the organic capabilities of chrome plating and minor plating.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, the Government is interested in procuring a wide range of existing Hartchrom tooling to support the 120mm, M256, 155mm M284 and 155mm M776 cannon systems. This tooling includes the following for various cannon systems:</p>
<p>120mm M256 CANNON:</p>
<p>4 each Full Length Anodes; 1 each Anodes and Cathodes combination; 4 each Lifting Device; 2 each Anodes and Cathodes combination (Chamber only); 2 each Anode Copper Core; 3 each Cathodes, 10 each Centering Device; 8 each Lifting Devices.</p>
<p>120mm R &amp; E CANNON: 1 each Cathode bolt on bottom; 1 each Anode for XM291</p>
<p>140mm R &amp; E CANNON: 1 each Lifting Device; 1 each Cathode bolt on bottom</p>
<p>155mm M284 CANNON: 4 each Anodes (Full Length); 2 each Cathodes; 3 each Centering Device; 1 each internal sandblaster; 13 each Lifting Devices; 1 each Pressure Washer.</p>
<p>155mm M776 CANNON: 3 each Anodes (Chamber Only); 3 each Anode &amp; cathode combo (Chamber only); 2 each Anode Copper Core.</p>
<p>155mm R &amp; E CANNON: 1 each Anode; 1 each Anode/Cathode Combo; 1 each Cathode bolt on bottom (Chamber only); 3 each cathode bolt on bottom</p>
<p>155mm XM97 CANNON: 1 each anode; 1 each Cathode bolt on bottom; 1 each Lifting Device</p>
<p>76MM cannon: 1 each Anode (Chamber only)</p>
<p>8 inch CANNON: 2 each Anodes; 1 each Anode (Chamber only)</p>
<p>155mm and 140mm R &amp; E CANNON: 7 each Lifting Devices and 1 each Centering Device</p>
<p>120mm facility: 75 each Anodes for stack testing, 3 each Stack Test Fixture; 2 each stack test plates</p>
<p><br />NOTE: It is anticipated that since this tooling was already manufactured specifically for use on various WVA produced cannon barrels, Hartchrom Inc. is the only identified source of existing tooling. Since WVA will begin organic chrome plating in the near term, it is also anticipated that a sole source contract will be pursued with Hartchrom Inc. to purchase this existing, serviceable tooling.</p>
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES. The Government requests interested parties to submit a company brochure (if available) and a tailored capability statement for these requirements that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. The description should also include any anticipated needs for sub-tier vendors.</p>
<p>Responses will be reviewed by U.S. Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC-WRN) (WVA), Watervliet Arsenal and the US Army personnel only and will be held in a confidential manner. Any and all information provided shall include a description of the proposed manufacturing capabilities. Submitted documentation will not be returned. <br /><br />Submission Information:</p>

<DESC>This RFI is for a Tactical Aerostat asset for potential use in small combat outposts, Forward Operating Base (FOB), or retrograde operations. The intent is to provide force protection and maneuver elements with real time situational awareness and communications relay on the battlefield. The Tactical Aerostat asset should be designed to be expeditionary and rapidly deployable in austere harsh environments. A Tactical Aerostat system typically consists of four major subsystems: The Aerostat, Payloads, Mooring Platform, and Ground Control Station (GCS). Emphasis for these Tactical Aerostats will be placed on systems that offer modularity for tailored mission payloads and automation features that reduce the overall manpower required to launch, operate, and recover the system. Operability and sustainability should be taken into account, knowing that soldiers may be asked to operate and maintain the systems.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Notice Information</p>
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a list of organisms considered Antimicrobial Resistance (AR) threats. Many of the organisms are multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.</p>
<p>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has identified a significant lack of suitable chemical libraries accessible for screening as a major scientific bottleneck for the discovery and development of novel antimicrobial drugs due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria. There is a scarcity of novel chemical classes or natural compounds with properties appropriate for Gram-negative cell penetration and efflux avoidance.</p>
<p>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement to support a Chemistry Center for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CC4CARB) for supporting efforts to design, synthesize and deliver novel compound libraries to the scientific community for use in antibacterial drug discovery programs, particularly those targeting Gram-negative bacteria. The center will fit within the broader aims as stated in the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria by synthesizing and delivering new compounds for antibacterial drug discovery, as well as chemical probes for establishing a better understanding of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for optimal activity against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Critical to the successful center will be strong capability for high-quality and timely synthesis of a diverse range of novel chemotypes, supported by well-organized process for review and approval of design proposals from external scientists and a seamless mechanism for managing the storage and distribution of the resulting compound libraries to the scientific community.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to create a new Chemistry Center for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CC4CARB) responsible for coordinating and conducting the design, synthesis and delivery of chemical libraries of small-molecules and discrete natural products with diverse physicochemical properties, specifically designed to target Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.</p>
<p>Project requirements</p>
<p>The CC4CARB will consist of requirements in three (3) key areas: 1) Chemical Library Design, 2) Compound Synthesis, and 3) Compound Management, and includes Project Management of all efforts across these requirements.</p>
<p>The center's Chemical Library Design requirement involves soliciting members of the scientific community for design ideas for new compound libraries and chemical series to elucidate SAR for Gram negative bacterial cell penetration and efflux avoidance and subsequent evaluations of the design idea proposals.</p>
<p>The center's Compound Synthesis requirement involves synthesizing the novel small-molecules that are identified through Chemical Library Design efforts and approved by NIAID, and for delivering these compounds to Compound Management effort for storage and distribution to the scientific community. The Government anticipates producing 20,000 rationally designed and structurally diverse compounds over the period of the contract.</p>
<p>The center's Compound Management requirement involves maintaining the resulting libraries in appropriate storage conditions and managing the distribution of compounds to members of the external scientific community, including public disclosure of compound structures, synthetic routes and handling specifications.</p>
<p>Critical to success of this effort will be assignment of a single Principal Investigator (PI), ideally skilled in synthetic chemistry, who will be accountable for coordinating all contract activities, along with comprehensive project management support, and for communicating progress and recommending approval decisions to the NIAID Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p><br />Anticipated period of performance</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, level-of-effort type contract will be awarded with a one-year base period beginning on or around December 01, 2020. Awards are anticipated to include four (4) one-year option periods. In addition, there will be three (3) one-year term options that may be exercised after the initial 5-year period of performance which would bring the total maximum period of performance to eight (8) years. The quantity options may be exercised at any time with the contract period of performance. The total period of performance, if all term and quantity options are exercised, shall be December 01, 2020 to November 30, 2028.</p>
<p>The Government's level-of-effort requirement is estimated at 28,000 direct labor hours for the base year and each term option (A1-A4).</p>
<p>The Government's level-of-effort requirement is estimated at 4,000 direct labor hours for each term option A5-A7.</p>
<p>Other important considerations</p>
<p>The Government anticipates producing 20,000 rationally designed and structurally diverse compounds over the period of the contract.</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk Mechanicsburg Contracting Office is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify vendors having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for Enterprise Infrastructure and Cybersecurity Contractor Support Services (CSS). This is a follow-on to RFI N0018919RCS00 with slight changes incorporated into the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) that is provided as an attachment.

The purpose of this contract is to provide a full range of Information Technology (IT) support services and infrastructure support to Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (NAVMETOCCOM), Stennis Space Center, MS, and its Echelon IV organizations.


This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes in determining the best method of procurement and building cost estimates. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any services whatsoever. Further, the Government is not seeking proposals or issuing a solicitation at this time and will not be accepting unsolicited proposals. Any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  

NAVMETOCCOM is requesting CSS to provide Enterprise Infrastructure and Cybersecurity.  The primary support of this requirement is to manage packages through the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process achieving an Authority to Operate (ATO) and then maintaining the system.
The draft PWS is provided as an attachment. The current acquisition strategy is to compete this requirement as a commercial firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (FFP IDIQ) contract. The determination as a single or multiple award IDIQ has yet to be made. The preliminary applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541519, Other Computer Related Services (vendors may suggest alternative NAICS).

If your organization has the experience and potential capacity to perform these requirements, please provide the following information: 1) organization name, address, email address, website address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; 2) tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort.
In addition, the Government is seeking additional information from interested vendors with regards to:

1.	Comments on the acquisition strategy mentioned above;
2.	Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of Labor Categories and burdened labor rates;
3.	If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability to include small businesses.

The RFI is to capture industrys best methods for this type of effort as indicated on the attached draft PWS. Please be very specific and detailed in your response.

In addition, the Government welcomes feedback, questions, or clarifications about any areas of the draft PWS including personnel qualification requirements and how they relate to the work being requested and how these requirements would affect staffing.
The Government is also interested in suggestions on NAICS code and PSC designations and existing contract vehicles for this type of procurement.

<SUBJECT>TSA Nitrile Gloves Recycling and Disposal 
<SOLNBR>70T01020I9NOSH001
<RESPDATE>102419
<CONTACT>Katya D Cruz, Contract Specialist, Phone 787-253-4717, Email katya.cruz@tsa.dhs.gov
<DESC>PURPOSE<br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to identify what innovative and cost-effective approaches exist to recycle nitrile gloves, or enable another method of environmentally-preferable disposition of nitrile gloves, and identify parties capable of supporting a such a program for the TSA Office of Occupational Safety, Health and Environment (OSHE).
<p>THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for information does not constitute a request for proposals or a promise to contract; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. Further, TSA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.<br />Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluation will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. For further information regarding a potential solicitation, please monitor the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Acquisition Planning Forecast System (APFS) at https://apfs.dhs.gov/.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The TSA currently uses approximately 130 million nitrile gloves annually to support screening activities at 450 Federalized airports. The physical and chemical properties of the nitrile gloves to be recycled are as follows:</p>
<p>Composition:</p>
<p>Nitrile Latex (NBR) <br />Anionic Stabilizer <br />Potassium Hydroxide <br />Zinc Oxide <br />Sulphur <br />Zinc Dithlocarbamate Group (ZDEC, ZDBC) <br />Titanium Diozide <br />C.I.: Blue 15</p>
<p>There may be occasional gloves in the waste stream made of an alternate material such as vinyl or cotton as a few TSA Transportation Security Officers may be allergic to the nitrile gloves. This amount, however, would be extremely low (trace amounts).</p>
<p>TSA is interested in identifying innovative, cost-effective, and environmentally-preferable approaches to recycle or dispose of the nitrile gloves.</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATIVE<br />Responses to this request are solely for the purpose of market research. Neither do they constitute pre-competition nor will they be evaluated in any way. Likewise, this request does not commit the U.S. Government to any course of action in the future. This request is issued solely for planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement; no basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this notice or Government use of any information provided.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the responses obtained will assist TSA with ensuring any final requirement is clearly defined to mitigate potential cost, schedule, and performance risk. The Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to comments and lessons learned from industry partners highlighting potential technical problem areas associated with this effort.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br />If your organization has the potential capacity to recycle nitrile gloves as discussed herein, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1) A cover letter that clearly identifies the following information:<br />&bull; Company Name<br />&bull; Company Address<br />&bull; DUNS Number<br />&bull; Point(s) of Contact (Name, email, and phone number)<br />&bull; Business Size and Socioeconomic Status<br />&bull; Years of Experience in Nitrile Rubber Recycling or Environmentally-Preferable Disposition<br />&bull; Company Overview (e.g., type of services/products offered)</p>
<p>(Page Limit: 1 Page)</p>
<p>2) A white paper that clearly identifies your innovative, environmentally-preferable approach to recycle or dispose of nitrile gloves and demonstrated experience with recycling or disposing nitrile gloves and/or other nitrile products. Your white paper must also address the recycling or environmentally-preferable disposition process of the gloves and any transportation requirements involved. TSA is also interested in learning what incentives if any, you have implemented with other clients to help increase the usage and viability of an environmentally-preferable nitrile rubber program. Please note your approach should be compliant with all environmental laws, regulations, and executive orders. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and must be clearly marked.</p>
<p>(Page Limit: 4 Pages)</p>
<p>3) Please submit any applicable GSA published price lists and/or line card pricing for recycling or disposing of similar products (if available). As reminder, there is no solicitation at this time and all information submitted in response to this RFI is for market research purposes only.</p>
<p>(Page Limit: None)</p>
<p>The information requested above must be submitted in writing and may be provided in a Microsoft Office 2010 or Acrobat Adobe PDF compatible document(s). Responses to this RFI must be submitted to TSA via electronic mail to katya.cruz@tsa.dhs.gov no later than 5:00 PM local Washington D.C. time on October 24, 2019. Responses not received by the closing date and time may not be considered or reviewed by TSA. Questions in support of this RFI will not be entertained.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. <br /><br />This is a Sources Sought Notice which serves as a market research tool to obtain information from industry and will be used for preliminary planning purposes. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Sources Sought notice or any follow-up information. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice.
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from all qualified and interested parties from Small Business (SB) Firms, Certified 8(a) Firms, Certified Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HubZone) Firms, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) for the potential maintenance dredging, various channel sections.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 236210 "Industrial Building Construction" with a size standard of $36,500,000.00. The magnitude of construction is between $5M and $10M. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>Project Description: This project is for the Base Contract of a new construction of a 15,000 gsf stand-alone one-story Specialized Material Fabrication Building with laboratory and general purpose administrative space, with (1) Option for an Additional 252 square yards of Asphalt Paving.<br />The new facility will enable specialized light industrial and materials fabrication activity in support of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Technology Application Branch (TAB) Mission at Fort George G Meade, Maryland. The space requirement is based on twelve (12) staff positions, a maximum of ten (10) students, and the equipment (Personal Property) necessary to execute Mission. The structure of the building will be Type II-B Construction as dictated by The International Building Code (IBC), which is non-combustible, unprotected construction. The building will be constructed to replace the existing facility on base and better support the current Mission. The facility is a mixed-use occupancy. The administrative space, classified as business occupancy, will be located in the western portion of the building, while the fabrication lab, classified as industrial occupancy, will be located in the eastern portion of the building. Although interconnected, the different occupancies will be compartmentalized in accordance to the minimum fire separations per NFPA occupancy separations. The facility will be access controlled and incorporate security measures to allow certification and use of SIPR IT systems in required administrative spaces. This facility will be ABA Compliant. The facility will be sprinkled for fire protection. The facility will be designed to meet LEED-NC v4 Silver "Certifiable" Rating, the DOD Force Protection Standards, and all other applicable codes and standards. <br />There are three buildings nearby, all with a shallow foundation indicating this site is probably suitable for building on a shallow foundation. The site is approximately 4.7 acres of flat land covered with small deciduous trees. Historically this was the site of a former fruit orchard. A wooden barracks was built on this plat sometime in the early twentieth century and subsequently demolished. Additionally, the location constitutes an historical site due to being the residence of former president General Dwight Eisenhower.<br />A minimum of 50,000 square feet of land needs to be cleared and grubbed for building, clear space and parking lot. At least 1000 cubic yards of topsoil will need to be excavated, and potentially used to build protective berms contingent upon suitability. Most rainwater drains by in-place soil infiltration. Storm water runoff capacity is minimal. Construction of drainage structures is likely required. The slope runs from south to north, and there is a natural ditch that transports water over the top of Chamberlin St. to the west. The entire eastern perimeter is relative high ground due to the elevation of Annapolis Road Route 175 having a higher finished grade.<br />Because of uncertainties in underground utilities an independent onsite investigation is needed. There are a series of man holes on the western side of the lot, apparently for a sewer running north-south. There are two transformer stations in the southeastern corner, possibly for the building located in the south or to power the perimeter fence region. There is a test well located near the intersection of Chamberlin St. and 4th Avenue, in the south west corner of the lot which will require protection and remain during and after construction. Per the Fort Meade Director of Public Works (DPW) the electrical company, BGE, would provide transformers and conditioned electrical power for the TAB building. Also, the contractor, American Water, will run a water line to the site, if one does not already exist. Both of which will require advance coordination.<br /><br />Interested qualified Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones), or Qualified Section 8(a) certified with single bonding capacity to support this project should submit capability statements to include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Company name, address, phone number and point of contact.</p>
<p>2. Company's System for Award Management (SAM) Cage Code and DUNS Number to verify your business status as a qualified Small Business (SB) Firm, Certified 8(a) Firm, Certified Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HubZone) Firm or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Firm. Contractors must be registered in SAM and completed the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please see www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>3. Provide details of three (3) most recent projects of similar scope and magnitude directly performed by your company, beginning and end dates of projects, project references (including owner with phone number and email address), floating plant and final costs of completed projects. It should also contain and identify all expertise, types and number of equipment, and number of personnel.</p>
<p>4. A letter from your surety stating your maximum bonding capability for a single project and your aggregate bonding capability.</p>
<p>The contractor should be familiar with the Federal safety manual and provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act. Narratives shall be no longer than 10 pages. Comments will be shared with the Government and the Project Delivery Team (PDT), but will be held otherwise in strict confidence.</p>
<p>Email your responses to MSG Nicole Brookes at nicole.c.brookes@usace.army.mil and Ms. Tamara Bonomolo at tamara.c.bonomolo@usace.army.mil no later than 1000 hours EST, 17 October 2019.</p>

Subsequently, a Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order was awarded on August 13, 2019 to Stripes Global Inc, a responsible Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) with the capability to fulfill the emergency requirement for the Eastern Oklahoma VA Health Care System (EOVAHCS).

FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items: The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2).

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): The Eastern Oklahoma VA Health Care System (EOVAHCS) is requiring an emergency mobile compounding pharmacy rental to be able to continue to provide sterile hazardous and non-hazardous medications while renovation/construction takes place due to the compliance timeline for USP <797> and <800> standards implementation. Due to the need to be in compliance with the standards implementation the renovation/construction and or corrective actions will begin once the inspection of the site is completed. Therefore, Eastern Oklahoma VA Health Care System (EOVAHCS) is emergently needing to acquire a mobile compounding pharmacy cleanroom rental to maintain pharmacy services and provide optimal patient care needs. The delivery, installation, and all certifications for these specialize rooms are needed on or before December 01, 2019. In reaching out to the commercial
market for Mobile Cleanroom Trailers  availability are backlogged to calendar year 2020 due to high demand. The lowest lead time for delivery, install, and certifications to be complete by December 01, 2019 was around 90 days from time of award by Stripes Global Inc. Stripes Global is the only vendor capable of providing the requested rental in the timeframe required to allow for continued patient care during the renovation/construction time. Not completing the procurement now will result in unacceptable delays in the renovation/construction to meet the compliance timeline and not having the required trailers in place for use and critically degrade the facility s ability to provide the necessary care to the Veterans during the renovation/construction timeframe.

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: Due to the emergent need, a quick market research was conducted to identify sources who can fulfill this requirement. Refer to paragraph 8 for market research details.

Determination by the CO that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: Based on the comparison to the prices found reasonable on similar contract 36C25919P0947, our order 36C25919P0965 ($1,226,077) is equal to the base plus 1 OY total for 36C25919P0947. It is hereby determined that pricing is both fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the government.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was conducted, in accordance with FAR Part 10, which included a quick search on VIP, FPDS, and in eCMS to identify sources for this emergent need. The VIP search resulted in only 1 SDVOSB (Stripes Global), FPDS resulted in only the Large Business Manufacturer (Germfree Laboratories), and eCMS resulted in 1 possible small business source (Modular Devices) identified with the capability of providing the requested items. Attempts to contact the possible vendor were made, resulting in only 1 vendor (Stripes Global) able to meet this emergent need in the timeframe required due to the high demand of the requested item. No phone contact or email response was ever received by Germfree Laboratories and Modular

VHAPM Part 806.3 Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP Attachment 2: Request for Sole Source Justification Format >SAT

Devices indicated the earliest they could deliver is January 2020 (not to include the install and certification required).

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: Mobile Cleanroom is required to be onsite and certified for use by December 1, 2019.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:

Modular Devices, Inc 6678 Guion Rd
Indianapolis, Indiana 46268

Stripes Global Inc 245 4th St Ste 204
Bremerton, Washington 98337

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place at the time a new Mobile Cleanroom Rental is required. Future actions for this type of requirement will be competed, depending on the market conditions, in compliance with small business regulations.

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />Researchers at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center have designed an innovative antenna-mounting platform that addresses an unmet need in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market and could even be applied to some satellite and marine applications.&nbsp; This unique continuously rotating platform is small and lightweight enough that one person can carry it, yet its simple setup and configuration can accommodate nearly 60 pounds of antennas, transmitters, and receivers in any combination.&nbsp; Powered by 120 VAC, the platform can move all of the antennas simultaneously in continuous rotation in azimuth and vertical &plusmn;180&deg;, effectively tracking a line-of-site object up to 20 miles away.&nbsp; Unlike other platforms currently available, the innovative, flexible design for smaller, low-power (&lt;10 W) transmission antennas uses less expensive motors, keeping the price tag below $5,000.&nbsp; It could be used to track any line-of-sight object carrying multiple radio frequency (RF) sources.</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />Visual acuity (clearness of vision), usually measured by an eye doctor using an eyechart, is one of the most commonly applied clinical tests in the world.&nbsp; With the patients participation, it measures the smallest letters that can be reliably identified at a specified distance, and thereby tests the resolving power of our eyes.&nbsp; The result, often quoted as a pair of numbers like 20:20, lets us know if corrective lenses or refractive surgery can help us better perform tasks like reading or driving.&nbsp; This invention provides an automated system to estimate visual acuity based on objective measurements of the eye optics and wavefront aberrations (WA).&nbsp; WA are represented in a particular form known as the Zernike polynomials. The WFAMetric is an algorithm that converts the list of numbers into an estimate of the visual acuity of the patient. If changes are planned to the WA of the patient the predicted change in acuity can be calculated.</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />Researchers at NASA's Glenn and Langley Research Centers have developed a groundbreaking bio-mimicking acoustic liner for quieting noisy environments. Conventional approaches have not been able to absorb sound effectively in the 400-3000 Hz range, thereby subjecting humans to excessive noise pollution at the low end of the auditory range.&nbsp; The NASA innovation relies on parallel-stacked tube filters, which improve noise reduction in this range by as much as 25% over conventional melamine or honeycomb solutions.&nbsp; Inspired by the structure of natural reeds, these porous tubes are arranged to maximize acoustic absorption while also realizing significant benefits in weight, size, and extreme-temperature functionality.&nbsp; Since broadband noise represents one of the most significant potential environmental constraints to increasing capacity, efficiency, and flexibility in a host of different arenas, this technology could prove invaluable in multiple applications including aircraft cabin liners, school buses and other vehicles, industrial environments, and building construction.</div>

<div>Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed a variable-frequency, alternating current (AC) power system to enable turbo-electric and hybrid electric propulsion.&nbsp; Glenn's technology uses double-fed electric machines and a high-voltage, variable-frequency power system to significantly decrease (by 85%) the weight of an aircraft's power electronics for turbo-electric propulsion, while still providing high specific power and variable thrust.&nbsp; To provide a safe system, the lightweight electric machines operate at high frequency, allowing fast detection and clearance of faults without requiring switchgear that interrupts the current.&nbsp; This design also reduces the protection system's weight, while improving reliability by minimizing fault energy and collateral damage potential.&nbsp; In addition, the system permits either sub-synchronous or super-synchronous operation relative to throttle position, without having to adjust turbine settings.&nbsp; Glenn's innovative system raises the ceiling for hybrid electric aircraft.</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div><br />Researchers at the NASA Johnson Space Center have developed a suite of RFID-based technologies focused on improving communication of an RFID reader with a greater number of RFID tags in open and enclosed areas.&nbsp; A typical RFID reader is limited to a narrow bandwidth due to existing communication protocols between a single RFID reader and its corresponding set of RFID tags.&nbsp; The Enhanced RFID Reader is able to expand these boundaries by integrating an inexpensive frequency multiplexer to the RFID reader, which substantially improves the resolution and accuracy of the reader localization capabilities.&nbsp; For enclosed areas, such as a large container, the Enhanced RFID Reader can use less and smaller antennas, consequently reducing the volume required for an RFID system to operate.&nbsp; A wide range of commercial applications can benefit from this technology, including retail inventory management, manufacturing/assembly line tracking, industrial transportation and logistics, sports bio-analysis, and healthcare.</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The Lighting System to Improve Circadian Rhythm Control was designed and built to help regulate the sleep cycles of astronauts working on the International Space Station (ISS) and during long-duration spaceflight.&nbsp; In space, the lack of a true diurnal cycle of sunlight, encompassing the same range of color temperatures and intensities of sunlight experienced on Earth, is one of the potential causes of sleep disorders among the crew aboard ISS.&nbsp; The production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles, can be inhibited by light, especially cool white light (with its large blue light component).&nbsp; To help regulate sleep cycles and improve the quality of sleep for the crew, control of the melatonin production cycle through the use of light is key.&nbsp; On Earth, this technology can be used to help treat many sleep disorders, including jet lag, shift work sleep disorder, delayed sleep phase syndrome, advance sleep phase syndrome, and non-24-hour sleep/wake disorder (frequently affects those who are totally blind since the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle over a 24-hour period).</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) Detection Photon Sieve is a variation of a tradition photon sieve, which focuses an OAM signal at the center point on the focal plane.&nbsp; With a traditional photon sieve an OAM signal focuses as a ring pattern on the focal plane and non-OAM signal focuses as a point at the center of the ring.&nbsp; This design inverts OAM and non-OAM signal patterns on the focal plane.</div>
<div><br />Current LiDAR systems use a traditional reflector dish for efficient collection of photons, which are directed to the system detectors.&nbsp; For space-based LiDAR applications, the reflector dish diameter is designed to meet the collection needs of the science measurement.&nbsp; However, as the reflector dish diameter increases to achieve the required science signal level, the background noise signal also increases.&nbsp; The highly sensitive detectors in the LiDAR receiver path reach a saturation point as a result of the increased background noise, making the measurement useless.&nbsp; In addition, the output laser energy is limited by the power available on the satellite and laser eye safety restrictions for ground observers.&nbsp; This limits the design of the LiDAR system to increasing the telescope aperture size and receiver path efficiency.&nbsp; This innovation was pursued to both increase the signal and reduce the noise while maintaining the phase of the signal.&nbsp; Most importantly, this photon sieve design provides a definitive measurement technique for the detection of specific orbital angular momentum modes.</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />This innovation, developed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, is a frame and motor system that maintains the alignment and stability of a solar sail throughout its mission life.&nbsp; Solar sails can enable high delta V (change in velocity) propulsion for small spacecraft in deep space beyond Low Earth Orbit.&nbsp; Solar sails use a large reflective film, and eliminate the need for propellants.&nbsp; Reflected sunlight produces solar pressure on the film, and the thrust produced, though minuscule, can provide large velocity deltas over a multi-year mission.&nbsp; This thrust however can also create disturbance torques due to misalignment of the solar sail center of mass (CM) and center of pressure (CP), and may cause the sail to fail should it become unbalanced and fold or wrap upon itself.&nbsp; The AMT system solves this challenge by enabling the long-term balance and stability of solar sail propulsion systems that set a new benchmark in packaging volume, propulsion efficiency and long-term operation, as well as safety.</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />A new smart camera developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center has the ability to process and transmit valuable edge location data for the images that it captures - at a rate of over 900 frames per second.&nbsp; The camera was designed to operate as a component in an inlet shock detection system for supersonic jets.&nbsp; A supersonic jet cannot function properly unless the airflow entering the machine is compressed and slowed to subsonic speed in the inlet before it reaches the engine.&nbsp; When supersonic air is compressed, it forms shock waves that can destroy the turbofan and surrounding components unless they are pinpointed and adjusted.&nbsp; This smart camera uses an edge detection signal processing circuit to determine the exact location of shock waves, and sends the location information via an onboard microcontroller or external digital interface.&nbsp; This highly customizable camera's ability to quickly identify precise location data makes it ideal for a variety of other applications where high-speed edge detection is needed.</div>

<div>&nbsp; <br />Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed a method for producing pure high-pressure oxygen via an electrochemical pumping process through a solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) cell stack.&nbsp; Glenn's device can either concentrate the oxygen in the ambient atmosphere or extract the oxygen via the chemical reduction of carbon dioxide, water, or any combination of these substances.&nbsp; This solid-state device does not use any moving parts or any extra separation processes to purify the delivered oxygen.&nbsp; Instead, Glenn's technology relies on a multi-stage stack design and an SOE process that includes an oxygen-ion-conducting ceramic membrane to generate high-pressure oxygen within a compact, noiseless device.&nbsp; This process has great potential for use in industrial, medical, and recreational applications.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />NASA's Langley Research Center has developed a new, low temperature method of SiGe/sapphire growth that produces the same single crystal films with much less thermal loading effort to the substrate.&nbsp; This eliminates the time-consuming and costly high heating, long thermal soak times, and interfacial Si layer.&nbsp; Yield and throughput are increased as time to production is reduced from over 4 hours to less than 1 hour. The same quality of SiGe/sapphire is produced with far less effort and time, bringing it to within the realm of mass production.</div>
<div><br />This innovation is based on a new fabrication method that alleviates the thermal loading requirement of the substrate, which previously required surface temperatures within the range of 850 to 900C.&nbsp; Our method employs a new thermal loading requirement of sapphire substrate for growing single crystal SiGe on sapphire substrate, in the range of 450 to 500C.&nbsp; SiGe/sapphire wafers produced via this process show a high reflectivity without the discoloration that appears in low quality films.</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />Automated Fiber Placement machines (AFP) can be susceptible to tow-tape defects such as gaps and overlaps.&nbsp; These can reduce strength between 7% and 32%. Automated inspection is not fully effective, and current AFP systems rely heavily on visual based inspections of each ply layer to detect and correct these tape defects.</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />The latent heat of the item under fabrication is used to create a thermal image of a just completed tape bond.&nbsp; The image is then analyzed to detect anomalies in real-time. The defect data can be used in a feedback process to guide the bonding operation and tag the defect location for subsequent inspection.&nbsp; Image processing is a key element of the successfully implementing the process.&nbsp; The image process technique used not only reduces processing resources (such as CPU usage, memory, etc.), but also allows for a number of standard time-based analysis algorithms, typical of flash thermography, to be applied to the data (the reconstructed sequence).</div>

<div><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />NASA Langley Research Center has developed a method of using x-ray diffraction (XRD) to detect defects in cubic semiconductor (100) wafers.&nbsp; The technology allows non-destructive evaluation of wafer quality in a simple, fast, inexpensive process that can be easily incorporated into an existing fab line.&nbsp; The invention adds value throughout the semiconductor industry but is especially relevant in high end, high speed electronics where wafer quality has a more significant effect on yields.</div>
<div><br />This technology is a method of using x-ray diffraction (XRD) to evaluate the concentration of crystal structure defects, and thus the quality, of cubic (100)-oriented semiconductor wafers.&nbsp; Developed to enhance NASA's capabilities in fabricating chips for aeronautics applications, the method supplants existing methods that not only destroy the wafer in question, but can take as long as a day to determine the quality of a single wafer.&nbsp; The approach can be used with any commonly used semiconductor, including silicon, SiGe, GaAs and others, in a cubic (100) orientation, which covers at least 90% of commercial wafers.&nbsp; It can also be used to evaluate the quality of epi layers deposited on wafer substrates, and of ingots before they are sliced into wafers. Uses for these technologies exist in fiber-optic test and measurement applications.</div>

<SOLNBR>N00039_SNOTE_0010C526

<a href="mailto:editha.bredesen@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>NAVAL INFORMATION WARFARE SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVWAR), on behalf of the Program Executive Office Tactical Aircraft Programs (PEO(T)) and the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Program Office (MPO), intends to award sole source modification to contract N00039-15-D-0043 Viasat, Inc. (6155 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, CA 92009) to produce and estimated quantity of 300 MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) Crypto Module (LCM) in support of the BU2 MIDS-Low Volume Terminal (LVT) upgrades to the base Indefinite Delivery Quantity Multiple Award Contract (MAC) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible.  A Justification and Approval (J&A) is expected to be approved and posted to e-commerce, as required by AT&L memorandum Public Disclosure of Justification and Approval Documents for Noncompetitive Contracts dated 13 February 2009.
The ordering period will coincide with the remaining ordering period for the Basic IDIQ MAC N00039-15-D-0043, which was extended from five (5) to ten (10) years through 25 June 2025.  The contract modification will add ceiling and new Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for LCM procurement.
LCM development and production was originally awarded to Viasat on Contract N00039-10-D-0032 as part of a limited competition between the two MIDS LVT vendors, DLS and Viasat, for a modernized crypto solution.  Viasat is the sole vendor of the LCM and has been producing them since 2011 under contract N00039-10-D-0032.  It is likely that award to a source other than the Viasat would result in substantial duplication of cost to the United States for design,  development and qualification of a new crypto module. In addition, award to  another source other than Viasat would result in delays in crypto modernization activities for US and partner nations. The cost associated with development  and qualification of a new source is not expected to be recovered through competition and is not planned in the program budget.
Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Sam Butler sam.butler@viasat.com at Viasat, Inc.
THIS SYNOSIS IS PUBLISHED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSESE ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Responses to this notice of  intent to award to Viasat, Inc. should be submitted no later than fifteen (15)  calendar days from the date of this synopsis to Ms. Editha Y. Bredesen, Contracting Officer, at editha.bredesen@navy.mil at Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR), Code 2.4, 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 334220- Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. The Federal Supply Class (FSC) code is 5821- Radio and TV Equipment, Airborne.
DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A: Approved for public release, distribution is unlimited (2 OCTOBER 2019)

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE

The Naval War College has a requirement to facilitate CFMCC, and ELOC courses in accordance with the provided statement of work. Under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the product or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government.

As evidenced in the sole source justification provided by the requiring activity there is only one contractor that has the specific qualifications that meet the peculiar requirements of this contract.
The CFMCC course will be taught in Miami, Florida to support regional maritime commanders and senior leaders attending (as students) and lecturing (as guest speakers) at the course. NWC resident faculty members prepare and coordinate the course syllabus, procure teaching materials, and fund administrative expenses. Because the course attendees are I and 2 star US and foreign flag officers, it is necessary to contract an individual who can serve as a senior fellow and support faculty for the courses. The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, operational experience as a Commander at the operational level of war (senior/executive levels), familiarity with the regional maritime issues, an understanding of Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level.
The ELOC course is tailored for an officer in the rank/pay-grade of Navy Captain/O-6 on the numbered fleet staff to bridge educational gaps between courses offered for the Flag level and those offered to officers in the pay-grades of 0-2 through 0-5. The course is taught at the NWC campus in Newport, RI with students assigned TAD for the week-long ELOC. NWC resident faculty members prepare and coordinate the course syllabus, procure teaching materials, and fund administrative expenses. Because the course attendees are senior 0-6s, it is necessary to contract an individual who can serve as a senior fellow and support faculty for the course. The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, operational experience in maritime warfare at senior/executive levels, experience as a numbered Fleet Commander, familiarity with the regional maritime issues, an understanding of Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level.

The Contractor identified is VADM (Ret.) Costello.
The period of performance will be from date of contract award to 31 August 2020. The NAICS code is 611710 and the small business size is $16.5M.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal, capability statement or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC><br />The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Technology Application Contracting Office (TAKO) intends to procure engineering support services to perform Safety of "<span style="COLOR: #282828">Flight Qualification Testing" on the Parvus DuraNET 20-11 Ethernet Switch by </span>utilizing a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. The proposed source is Curtiss-Wright Defense Solutions, 3222 South Washington Street, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84115. The associated NAICS code is 334513 - Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables. The size standard is 750.
<p><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Curtiss-Wright owns the technical data rights for the Ethernet Switches and they are unwilling to sell the technical data package at this time. To replace all of the units would result in substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delay.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities statements or proposals received within the closing date set in this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All interested, capable, and responsible sources that would like to respond to this synopsis are encouraged to provide a statement of interest along with supporting documentation to Latisha S. Blake, Contract Specialist, via email at latisha.s.blake.civ@mail.mil no later than 11:00am EST on Tuesday, 15 October 2019.</p>

The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516.
This equipment will serve to expand and upgrade existing software and equipment currently in use, accelerating our ability to make progress in VA research goals.
This equipment upgrade and expansion will be available to the preclinical Nephrology department for long term blood pressure studies in mice. Currently, our telemetry system has the capacity to measure 12 animals simultaneously. This number of animals has been satisfactory for running one experiment at a time. As our reliance on telemetry has grown, this size of a system has resulted in a significant back-log of experiments. This acquisition will double our capacity.  This is an upgrade to existing software currently being used.

The product requested is the Ponemah Software System and corresponding components.  See description below.

Ponemah software system
Telemetry interface upgrade (ART to Ponemah)
Ponemah core software
Analysis module
Computer
Software license
Ambient pressure reference
Matrix 2.0
Network switch
Receivers (12 count)
VPN router
Power Supply
Matrix 2.0 (2 count)

These items include all equipment and software necessary for our radio telemetry upgrade and expansion.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than Tuesday, 10/8/2019 at 10:00 AM ET.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

All quotations shall be submitted to Kevin Young via email at kevin.g.young@navy.mil. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement. The Government will award to the responsible Quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. In determining the best value to the Government, the combined non-cost/price factors are equally important to the cost/price factor. The Quoters are advised that the quotation meeting the solicitation requirements with the lowest price may not be selected for award if award to a higher priced Quoter is determined to be more advantageous to the Government.
However, the perceived benefits of the higher priced quotation must merit the additional price.

Factor 1: Technical

The Government will evaluate the Quoters Service Worksheet (Attachment (2)) for capability to provide service(s) in required countries (if country capability exists) referenced in the SOW.

Factor 2: Price

The quoters Quote Sheet (Attachment (1)) will be checked for mathematical correctness in all computations, making sure that all prices are summarized correctly to ensure completeness and accuracy. Changes to the evaluation quantities, blanks or zeros in the pricing columns, and/or mathematical mistakes are subject to clarification for confirmation of the Quoters intent.
These factors will be used to assess whether the quote is complete and accurate, and to minimize performance risk. The total contract price will be calculated by adding the totals of the base year and all option years.

Rating Methods:

The Technical factor will be rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. In order to be considered acceptable, the quotation must meet the minimum country requirements for service(s), direct dialing, and automatic roaming. A quotation is unacceptable if it fails to meet the minimum country requirements for service(s), direct dialing, and automatic roaming.

For any questions, please contact Kevin Young via email at kevin.g.young@navy.mil. Questions Submission:  Interested offerors must submit questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable timely response.
Please submit questions no later than 1600 hours Chamorro Standard Time on Monday October 7, 2019. Questions received after deadline will not be considered.

System for Award Management (SAM). Quoters must be registered in the SAM database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.sam.gov/. 
 
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking proposals to provide Design, Design Review and Construction Oversight Services for USAID's Mission in Maputo, Mozambique as described in the attached Request for Proposals (RFP). USAID anticipates awarding multiple contracts for a period of five (5)-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IDIQs). USAID anticipates that these multiple awards will be restricted to local and locally established organizations.
<p>Task orders will be placed with local and locally established organizations in accordance with Section F.8 ordering procedures.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum aggregate ordering limitation for contracts resulting from this RFP will be $5 Million over the 5-year ordering period. The maximum aggregate dollar value of task orders awarded to all contractors cannot exceed this contract ceiling. This ceiling is not being subdivided among the number of awardees nor is it being multiplied by the number of awardees. There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractors will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order guarantee set forth in the RFP.</p>
<p>Please refer to Section L for information regarding proposal requirements. Offerors should take into account the expected delivery time required by the proposal transmission method they choose, and they are responsible for ensuring proposals are received at USAID by the due date and time as specified in Section L. Failure to comply with the submission date and time will deem any submission unacceptable and it will not be reviewed or evaluated. Faxed proposals are not acceptable, nor will they be reviewed or evaluated.</p>
<p>Section L of the RFP sets forth all instructions for the preparation and submission of required proposal contents, including critical dates/times for the submission of questions, and the proposal submission closing date and time. Section M states the criteria by which proposals will be evaluated. Oral explanations or instructions, if any given before award of the contract will not be binding.</p>
<p>USAID will hold a pre-proposal conference to help clarify any parts of the RFP or process. Any questions and answers during the pre-proposal conference will be recorded and included in the Amendment of this solicitation and posted in www.fedbizopps.gov. The pre-proposal conference will be held at the address below:</p>
<p>USAID/Mozambique<br />JAT Complex<br />Rua 1231, Nr. 41<br />Maputo<br />Mozambique</p>
<p>Should you intend to participate in the aforementioned conference, please provide the names of the individuals that will represent your entity at the pre-proposal conference to fsultan@usaid.gov by not later than October 17, 2019 at 3:00 pm (Maputo Local Time).<br />At this time USAID kindly requests that no more than 3 people per entity attend the pre-proposal conference.</p>
<p>This RFP in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay for any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. Award of a Contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals.</p>
<p>This RFP can be viewed and downloaded from www.fedbizopps.gov. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same website from which you downloaded the solicitation. USAID advises to regularly check the above website for amendments.</p>

<DESC>On November 19, 2001, the President and Congress enacted ATSA, which established TSA as a new Federal agency. ATSA provides authority to the Administrator of TSA to carry out chapter 449 of Title 49 United States Code relating to civil aviation security, including responsibility for ordering the deployment of law enforcement personnel at each airport security passenger-screening location to ensure passenger safety and national security.<br /><br />Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &sect; 44903(c) and 49 C.F.R. Part 1542, each airport operator is required to establish an air transportation security program that provides a law enforcement presence and capability at the airport that is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers. This Agreement is part of the joint effort of TSA and the airport operator to deploy sufficient LEOs in support of passenger screening activities at the checkpoint to meet their dual responsibility to ensure the safety of passengers and to counter risks to transportation security.<br /><br />The LEO Reimbursement Program (LEORP) in the Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service currently provides partial reimbursement to approximately 300 airports, via OTAs, in order to offset the costs of carrying out Aviation law enforcement responsibilities in support of passenger screening activities. The amount of partial reimbursement to these current participants is based on factors including an airport's specific security requirements, number of checkpoints and lanes, and the availability of funds. Moving forward the Program may, consistent with Congressional direction and subject to the availability of funds, increase the number of participating airports and provide reimbursement for a broader range of LEO services, to include increasing the presence of LEOs in the public areas of airports.<br /><strong><br />This solicitation is issued to establish an OTA for TSA Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Agreement Program (LEORP). Applicants are requested to review the attached solicitation and its associated attachments (Attachments 1, 2, 3 and 4). Please review all documents carefully.<br /></strong><em><strong><br />Please note (refer to the attached Synopsis Solicitation):</strong> <br /></em><strong><em><br />In Section 6, ARTICLE VI - AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS, funds are not presently available for this OTA. The Government's obligation under this OTA is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for OTA purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this OTA and until the Participant receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <br /></em></strong><strong><em><br />In Section 6, ARTICLE VII - OBLIGATION AND PAYMENTS.B, it is likely that the TSA will develop a maximum rate that will be used for reimbursement purposes. Reimbursement may be at this rate or at the actual cost, whichever is the lesser of the two. This maximum rate will be based on information that will not be available until the submission review process. The TSA reserves the right to modify the maximum rate during the period of performance as necessary to optimize the impact of the program. Currently the maximum hourly rate for reimbursement is actual costs not-to-exceed $20.00/hr.</em></strong>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(e)</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p><br />1.0 GENERAL STATEMENT</p>
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers - Portland District has a requirement to solicit for services to refurbish the turbine inboard guide bearing for Fishpump #3 at John Day Dam, Oregon. Refurbish means removing the existing Babbitt, spin casting new Babbitt, and finish machining. The Contractor shall perform these services in accordance with the terms of the contract and as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to:</p>
<p>1. Remove the existing Babbitt and tinning material. Machine or shot blast to bare metal, including dovetail grooves, and proceed immediately with tinning. Special care shall be taken to protect all holes and surfaces of the bearing not receiving Babbitt. Plug such holes with a heat resistant filler material. Before bolting the split lines together for tinning, place heat resistant material in the joints to prevent leakage.<br /><br />2. When a dovetail falls on a split line, a mill cut may be taken the length of the joint to remove the dovetail and create a square land parallel to the joint face.</p>
<p>3. The bearing shall be spin cast with the bearing axis horizontal and the Babbitt poured at a high temperature. The bearing shell, and mandrel if used, shall be pre-heated. The pouring shall be continuous. Cold checks will not be acceptable. Precautions shall be taken to minimize bearing distortion during Babbitting.</p>
<p>4. The centerline of the Babbitted bore shall be established. If required for the purpose of establishing the centerline, a full-face skim cut may be made on both faces of the mounting flange, however, no more than 0.015 inch shall be removed from each face without the Government's approval</p>

<p>6.0 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY (PRS)</p>
<p>The PRS is intended to ensure that the Government receives the services for which it contracted. The Government will only pay for services received. The Performance Requirement Summary (PRS) determines if the Contractor meets the performance standards of the contract, as well as provides guidelines for how and when surveillance will be performed. It ensures timeliness, effectiveness, and that the Contractor is delivering the results specified in the contract. Government contract quality assurance will be performed at such times and/or places as may be necessary to determine the services conform to contract requirements.</p>
<p>The Contractor service requirements are summarized into performance objectives that relate directly to mission essential items. The performance threshold briefly describes the minimum acceptable quality levels (AQL) of service required for each requirement. These thresholds are critical to mission success.</p>
<p>6.1 Performance Requirements Summary Table</p>
<p>Below are the criteria against which the performance will be evaluated. Work shall be considered not to have been performed when any one of the following conditions exists in accordance to the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY<br />Required Services (Tasks) Performance Standards Acceptable Quality Levels <br />Surveillance Validated Complaints<br />Bearing Refurbishment<br />[PWS Paragraph 5.1-5.2] Perform bearing re-babbit work to the specifications outlined. Zero deviation from PWS 100%<br />Inspection 0 per project</p>
<p>6.2 Surveillance<br />100% inspections by the Government will serve as the surveillance methods. If the COR discovers deficiencies and/or receives complaints, the COR will alert the Contractor for correction.</p>

By initialing and dating the form, the Contractor is only acknowledging notification of unacceptable performance. Disputes in surveillance should be referred to the KO.</p>
<p>The COR will notify the KO of less than acceptable performance. If any of the services do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount. When the defect(s) in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may:</p>
<p>a. Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure future performance conforms to contract requirements.<br />b. Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.<br />c. If the Contractor fails to promptly re-perform the services, or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may:<br />i. By contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service; <br />ii. Issue Cure Notice;<br />iii. Terminate the contract for Government convenience; and / or<br />iv. Terminate the contract for Cause.<br /><br />6.8 Correction of Non-Performance of Work.<br />Contractor shall employ an adequate quantity of personnel to ensure that any area found to be not in compliance and, therefore not acceptable, shall be made acceptable by the performance or re-performance of the work, where such re-performance is possible, during the first business day after noncompliance has been observed by or reported to and verified by the COR.</p>
<p>6.9 Damages Caused by the Contractor<br />Contractor shall be held accountable and liable to the Government for any damages to Government facilities, fixtures, furnishings, equipment, plantings (except those impacted by the intended work), or grounds (including roads) caused by the Contractors or their employees.</p>

(ii) The management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more service-disabled Veterans (or eligible surviving spouses) or, in the case of a service-disabled Veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such Veteran;
(iii) The business meets Federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code identified in the solicitation document;
(iv) The business has been verified for ownership and control pursuant to 38 CFR 74 and is so listed in the Vendor Information Pages database, (https://www.vip.vetbiz.va.gov); and
(v) The business will comply with VAAR subpart 819.70 and Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations regarding small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 121.406 and 125.6, provided that any reference therein to a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern (SDVO SBC), is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB. The nonmanufacturer rule and the limitations on subcontracting apply to all SDVOSB and VOSB set-asides and sole source contracts.
(2)  Service-disabled Veteran  means a Veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16).
(b) General.
(1) Offers are solicited only from eligible service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns. Only VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns (SDVOSBs) may submit offers in response to this solicitation. Offers received from concerns that are not VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns shall not be considered.
(2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern that meets the size standard for the applicable NAICS code.
(c) Representation. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpart 819.70. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible. Therefore, any reference in 13 CFR part 121 and 125 to a service disabled Veteran-owned small business concern (SDVO SBC), is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB and only such concern(s) qualify as similarly situated. The offeror must also be eligible at the time of award.
(d) Agreement. When awarded a contract (see FAR 2.101, Definitions), including orders under multiple-award contracts, or a subcontract, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR part 121.406 and 125.6, provided that for purposes of the limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs shall be considered eligible and/or  similarly situated  (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An independent contractor shall be considered a subcontractor. An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to the following:
(1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.
(2) Supplies or products.

(4) Special trade contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, it will not pay more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.
(5) Subcontracting. Any work that a VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. For mixed contracts and additional limitations, refer to 13 CFR 125.6.
(e) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any reference therein to service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern or SDVO SBC, is to be construed to mean a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants.
(f) Precedence. For any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA program for service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns and the VA Veterans First Contract Program, as defined in VAAR subpart 819.70 and this clause, the VA Veterans First Contracting Program requirements have precedence.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address questions AND attach a REVISED Attachment C (Price Schedule).
<p><strong>Offerors must use the REVISED Attachment C (Price Schedule) in submitting price quotes.</strong></p>
<p>Question 1: Under the Shoes/Boots section and several other places throughout the request, multiple part numbers that price differently are given for the same line.  How would you like us to submit pricing for these items on a single line?</p>
<p>Response 1: Attachment C, Price Schedule has been updated to allow for single pricing per item/number.</p>
<p>Question 2: Under the Shoes/Boot section, the line for "Shoe Oxford Women's", these styles have been discontinued by the manufacturer and combined into their male styles (2 of them listed in the line above). Can you delete this line?</p>
<p>Response 2: The Line for "Shoe Oxford Women's" Rocky brand has been deleted.</p>
<p>Question 3: Under Honor Guard section, the line for "Belt Hook Flat Wire". Can you provide a photo of this item because Muscatello's does not make that product.</p>
<p>Response 3: Photographs of "Belt Hook Flat Wire" have been included (see attached photos)</p>
<p>Question 4: Under Honor Guard section, the line for "Pants Braid and or Sleeve Braids". Is this to be priced as adding to each piece of uniform clothing or as buying the actual braid in bulk from us?</p>
<p>Response 4: Please provide pricing for a roll of 1 &frac12; inch wide light blue braid in a small bulk amount and the cost of adding it to each piece of required uniform clothing which would be the honor guard pants (each leg) and the honor guard blouse (each sleeve).</p>
<p>Question 5: Regarding this bid for BEP Police Uniforms and Equipment, there are two items where part numbers are not listed and the description is vague.<br />Under Honor Guard section:<br />&bull;	Belt Hook Flat Wire<br />&bull;	Pants Braids or Sleeve Braids &frac34; inch light blue<br />Could you please supply photos of these items so we know we're specking out the product you truly need?</p>
<p>Response 5: Photographs of the Honor Guard "Belt Hook Flat Wire" and the light blue 1 &frac12; inch wide Honor Guard pants and Blouse sleeve braids have been included (see attached photos)</p>
<p>Question 6: Regarding this bid for BEP Police Uniforms and Equipment, if we are bidding on the same exact brand/style/part number you requested, do we still need to list full product specifications and warranty info in our bid packet?</p>
<p>Response 6: No. There's no need to list full product specifications if bidding on the same exact brand/style/part number of the item. Offeror shall indicate that they are proposing the exact brand.  Warranty info must be stated in your offer</p>

<DESC>QUESTION AND ANSWER
<p>QUESTIONS</p>
<p><br />1. What is the resolution you are looking for? X &amp; Y Pixel?<br /> <br />2. What is the recording time you wish to achieve? Is it relly 50 ms?<br /> <br />3.  And what is the target cost?</p>
<p>ANSWERS</p>
<p>1.  Resolution: The pixel size should be &lt;15 microns and there should be at least 512 x 512 pixels in the sensor, with 1024 x 1024 preferred. <br /> <br />2.  Recording time: Unfortunately there's not a simple answer for this since we are not taking a continuous recording, which is what a recording time specification implies. The time between frames should be &lt;10 microseconds, preferably &lt;1 microseconds. We only need 4 frames in a 10 ms period every 50 ms (the other 40 ms are spent preparing the atoms to be imaged), but we need to repeat that for up to 72 hours. So the recording time could be interpreted as 10 ms or 72 hours. The frequency at which the data can be downloaded is therefore important (it should be every few 10 to 100 ms), making the 50 ms window the quantity that makes more sense to quote. It's a somewhat strange situation so the typical language doesn't really apply.</p>
<p>3.  Target cost will not be disclosed.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Special Operations Forces and Personnel Recovery Division, Special Warfare (formerly Battlefield Airmen) Branch will host a presolicitation conference with industry regarding three requirements, currently planned to result in the following three solicitations: Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I, RFI FA8629-19-R-5001), Inventory Control Point (ICP, RFI FA8629-19-R-5002), and Multiple-Award IDIQ contract (MAC, RFI FA8629-19-R-5003). </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The presolicitation conference will begin Tuesday, 26 February 2019 at 9:00am at the Montgomery County Business Solutions Center in Dayton, OH (1435 Cincinnati Street, Suite 300; Dayton, OH 45417). The general schedule is attached. The presolicitation conference will include an introduction to the Special Warfare (SW) Program Office mission and customers and an in-depth explanation of the three interrelated contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">There will be opportunities for one-on-one meetings between vendors and the government each hour from Wednesday, 27 February through Friday, 1 March as shown in the attachment. During the one-on-one meetings, vendors will have a maximum of 50 minutes to present information to, and answer questions from, the government. During the first 25 minutes of each session, the vendor will brief the government with answers to specific questions from the government based on the vendor's RFI response, if one was submitted in response to the above RFIs. Questions will be sent to vendors in January or early February to provide sufficient time to prepare for the one-on-one meetings. During the second 25 minutes, the government will ask questions, some of which will be common to all vendors and others specific to the vendor's briefing and/or RFI response. Each vendor that registers for the presolicitation conference may request a one-on-one meeting slot by responding to the points of contact below.&nbsp;Vendors may request but are not guaranteed a specific time slot. A private conference room will be available to each vendor 50 minutes prior to the designated one-on-one session to allow for preparation, followed by a presentation in a separate room. Detailed instructions for one-on-one meetings will be sent to vendors that register.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Vendors planning to participate in the presolicitation conference must confirm attendance and must request a one-on-one session <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">no later than 5pm</strong> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">EST Tuesday, 19 February 2019 to Randolph Hildebrandt at <a>randolph.hildebrandt.2@us.af.mil</a> and copy Capt Ben Coffman at benjamin.coffman.1@us.af.mil. </strong>Each vendor or team may bring no more than two (2) representatives, though the government may consider larger delegations. Participants must submit the names and titles of all attendees by 19 February. The government reserves the right to limit attendees to only those who preregister in accordance with this announcement. Vendors are encouraged to access all three RFIs mentioned above, which can be found by searching on <a href="https://www.fbo.gov">https://www.fbo.gov</a>. </span></p>

Submitting information in conjunction with the presolicitation conference or associated RFIs is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated. Information provided will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the government will arise as a result of contractor presentations or information provided during or in preparation for the presolicitation conference or the government's use of such information. This request does not constitute authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for these efforts. The information provided may be used by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition-sensitive information contained within their response.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

<CONTACT>Darlene H. Tucker 757-341-0093
<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to notify potential offerors of an FFP/IDIQ for Vertical Transportation Equipment Maintenance and Repair services at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, VA; JEB Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, VA; and Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, VA and at sites located within a 50-mile radius of the listed sites.

The work includes but is not limited to: providing procedural compliance, work conformance
to established standards, suitability/completeness of required documentation and provided data, scheduling of preventative maintenance and recurring work, timeliness of work completed based on contractual requirements, communication, effectiveness of quality assurance, and overall quality of the services provided at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, VA; JEB Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, VA; and Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, VA and at sites located within a 50-mile radius of the listed sites.

The work identified is to be provided by means of a combination Firm-Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity type of contract.
  Source Selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that provides the lowest price and is technically acceptable to the Government. Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Method.  In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology:  Proposals will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest priced to highest price).  The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the lowest priced proposal.  The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  However, if the lowest priced proposal is not found to be technically acceptable, the Navy, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to increase the number of proposals it will review, until the Government identifies a technically acceptable proposal.
 Accordingly, under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both technical and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.  Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss or revise their proposals.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both non-price and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.

The solicitation and resulting contract award will be a performance-based service acquisition made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposals (RFP), will be advantageous to the Government price and other evaluation factors considered.
 The offerors proposal shall contain a response to each of the evaluation factors and shall be in the form prescribed by the solicitation. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors:  Factor 1  Technical Approach/Management, Factor 2  Corporate Experience, Factor 3  Safety and Factor 4  Past Performance.  NOTE:  Offerors MUST be evaluated as technically ACCEPTABLE under factors 1, 2, 3 and 4 in order to be considered technically acceptable overall.

Factor 2 Corporate Experience and Factor 4 Past Performance:  The Offeror shall submit projects that are similar in size, scope and complexity to the solicitation.  

Size:  A maintenance and repair service contract with a yearly value of at least $500,000.00 or 
greater for recurring services.

Complexity:  Demonstrate the ability to respond simultaneously to service calls and maintenance requirements for repair, alteration, demolition and minor construction at various locations and buildings throughout the installation and supporting annexes.
 Demonstrate the ability to manage competing priorities in order to support customer demands.

Offers shall be submitted for the performance of work for a period of one year.  However, the initial term of the contract may be for a period of less than one year.

<DESC>The Request for Proposal (RFP)/Solicitation to provide non-personal, healthcare environmental cleaning and related services in support of multiple Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Health Service Area (HSA) of Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC), Fort Bragg, NC. This acquisition is solicited as an 8(a) set-aside under other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.204(a). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this solicitation is 561720. This solicitation will be awarded using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) evaluation criteria. The agency proposes to award an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders for healthcare environmental cleaning services will be issued. An IDIQ contract is the optimal contract type for this effort as an exact quantity and/or appropriate categorization of services (Type I, II, III, IV, V, etc.) cannot be determined on an MTF-specific, individual room basis at the time of contract award. The resultant FFP task orders issued against the IDIQ will clearly describe WAMC MTF-specific healthcare environmental cleaning requirements and services to be performed and provide for prices that will not be subject to any adjustment on the basis of the 8(a) contractor's cost experience in performing this contract. All services shall be FFP and subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards (41 U.S.C. 351). This solicitation and subsequent contract will include contract line item numbers (CLINs) with a 5-year ordering period. The anticipated IDIQ contract will obligate the government to the minimum guarantee of $1,500.00 for the post award conference. The entire amount of the minimum guarantee will be obligated against fiscal year (FY) 20 funds. Further obligations will be charged to the FY in which the order is placed. Healthcare housekeeping services are required for 60 months starting 15 March 2020 through 14 March 2025. All elements of the RFP shall be submitted by the Offeror with a proposal no later than the date/time shown in block 8 of the Standard Form (SF) 1449, Solicitation/Contract Order for Commercial Items. The square feet (SF) for cleaning of each MTF is varied; however, the estimate SF for WAMC MTFs is 1,336,102 SF.

The TED office was newly established in late 2018 to support a seamless transition from military-to-civilian life and accelerate the economic empowerment and development of transitioning Servicemembers, Veterans, family members, caregivers, and survivors. VA established this office to ensure the entire period of military transition readiness, prior to separation through the first year of civilian life is efficient and thorough, ensure through a coordinated effort that Servicemembers leaving the military have an understanding of, and easy access to, all benefits and resources they are entitled to once they have separated from military service. TED accomplishes this by supporting military to civilian transition through administering VA's Transition Assistance Program (TAP); enhancing the use of VA education and career counseling; and coordinating and strengthening partnerships between federal, Military Service Organizations (MSOs), Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), Veterans peer groups, community organizations and private sector. </span></p>

Sources Sought Notice
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Technical Integration (OTI) Systems of Systems Integration 
September 27, 2019

Introduction

This Sources Sought Notice is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry practices, and input specific to the information provided.  

The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information.  All costs associated with responding to this Sources Sought Notice will be solely at the interested party s expense.  Not responding to this Sources Sought Notice does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to solicit feedback and determine capabilities in executing the Office of Technical Integration (OTI) Capabilities and Functions. 

Background
VA Office of Technical Integration (OTI) is charged with ensuring that the VA Priority Initiatives are coordinated, planned, and managed to achieve their stated goals and objectives. The Priority Initiatives are multi-year, cross-departmental modernization activities that have multiple operational (e.g., business functions and capabilities) and technical integration points (e.g., application interfaces and infrastructure modifications) that require direct oversight to ensure sustainable, scalable solutions are achieved. The VA Office of Information and Technology (OIT) authorized OTI to coordinate integration activities between the Priority Initiatives and the necessary enterprise organizations to provide the analysis and coordination required for proper technical integration. 

The VA OIT established OTI to facilitate communication and collaboration of technical integration activities between designated Priority Initiatives through technical coordination, planning and management. OTI ensures cross-initiative engagement with OIT to triage and route requirements to appropriate OIT (Office of Information Technology) offices, monitors status, facilitates risk and issue resolution, manages action tracking and coordinates subject matter expertise. Through OTI, the VA gains the ability to implement and coordinate technical integration across OIT, ensuring Priority Initiatives accomplish their intended VA strategic goals. 
Figure 1: As-Is OTI Organization Structure


The current OTI organizational structure includes four types of teams:
Technical Coordination Teams facilitate technical analysis to address gaps, overlaps and inconsistencies across the Priority Initiatives, including but not limited to: 
Data 
Cyber 
Infrastructure 
Interfaces
Interoperability Team is responsible for the interoperability of data.
Enterprise Schedule Management Team (ESMT) is responsible for the development and analysis of the integrated master schedule, inclusive of all Priority Initiatives. 
Business Operations Team facilitates business operations for OTI to support the management and oversight of the Priority Initiative s technical aspects.

OTI anticipates that this structure might change as OTI continues to understand its customers  needs and the external environment undergoes changes.

Initial Scope

The scope of OTI is focused on the technical points of intersection between OIT and Priority Initiatives to proactively engage OIT to address technical risks and issues during the planning, execution and implementation phases. The initial focus of OTI includes Priority Initiatives that will modernize Veteran healthcare, Veteran benefits, VA financial management and supply chain and the dependencies on VA s over 300 legacy systems. 

The Priority Initiatives are simultaneous, large-scale, and have dependencies on other Priority Initiatives and legacy systems. VA employs more than 322,030 full time health care professionals and support staff at 1,255 health care facilities; these employees and facilities are impacted in varying degrees by the priority initiative improvements. About VHA, https://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp, accessed September 5, 2019.
 OTI needs to take a Systems of Systems Engineering (SoSE) approach in how it supports VA and the success of the Priority Initiatives for the Veteran. 

OTI works across VA and with external partners and uses Agile principles and concepts, human-centered design discipline, and leverage Systems of Systems Engineering. The cadence of coordinating the OTI mission must support addressing customer problems.

Stakeholder engagement is paramount to VA s integration efforts; therefore, partnerships with existing teams (e.g., Office of Enterprise Integration (OEI), OIT, Veteran Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and other partners) will be leveraged to deconflict gaps, overlaps, and inconsistencies.

Core Elements and Functions

OTI will identify challenges and solutions using agile and human-centered approaches. OTI will view the Priority Initiatives as associated sub-systems to the broader VA enterprise systems of systems (SoS). 

The below are initial core elements and functions that OTI is looking for professional services assistance For more information, refer to the DoD Systems Engineering Guide for
Systems of Systems, Version 1.0, August 2008, Table 3-2 Technical & Technical Management Processes as They Apply to the Core Elements of SoS SE, https://www.acq.osd.mil/se/docs/SE-Guide-for-SoS.pdf
:

Translating Capability Objectives: This core element is the groundwork of the SoS for the remaining core elements; it provides information on the first-order goals and expectations for the VA enterprise SoS. The intent is to capture the overall objectives across the priority initiatives, such as integrating effective Veteran services and addressing their problems. The identified objectives then frame how the system of systems approach works across the constituent systems, such as reducing redundancy in data collected through effective data sharing. The SoS engineer (SoSE) and OTI leadership review objectives and expectations on a regular basis as the SoS evolves and changes occur in user (e.g. Veteran and VA employee) needs and the external environment.
OTI functions of interest in this area: Requirements Management and Stakeholder Management
Notional Scope: At the VA enterprise level, the SoSE must be able to identify the constituent systems and understand how they work together within the SoS. The SoSE gathers priority initiative requirements and dependencies on external systems, such as other priority initiatives and legacy systems. The SoSE must be able to organize and analyze the interdependencies to understand existing and anticipated enterprise risk, issues, and opportunities for mitigation or exploitation. 

Understanding Systems: Developing an understanding of the systems involved in the SoS and their relationships and interdependencies is one of the most important aspects of the SoSE role. Certain systems in the SoS may not be under direct management of the SoSE but may have a high impact on achieving SoS objectives. For example, Priority Initiatives do not necessarily fall under the OIT portfolio for management. The understanding in this capability includes how a system works, how it supports SoS objectives, and its development plans.
OTI functions of interest in this area: Risk Management (Integration), Enterprise Integrated Schedule Management
Notional Scope: Priority Initiatives may manage their own functional and technical activities, such as data collection, engineering and integration analysis and oversight of integrated master schedules (IMS). Schedules to include the IMS and sub-schedules may include external dependencies depicted as milestones necessary to achieve their objectives. OTI works with Priority Initiatives to identify events as critical enterprise milestones, assess critical paths, associated risks, and collaborates with necessary stakeholders on ensuring successful execution. This OTI functions provides insights on cross-initiative integration at the granularity and frequency needed by OTI s customers. 

Assessing Performance: In this core element, the SoSE works with the test and evaluation community to establish technical performance measures and methods for assessing overall performance of the SoS. Metrics and methods for assessing SoS performance should be independent of implementation, highlighting important VA enterprise functions.
OTI functions of interest in this area: Performance Management, Technical Assessment, Validation
Notional Scope: Each Priority Initiative has its own metrics and tools to measure system performance. Their system must interact with other systems, to include other Priority Initiatives and legacy systems. OTI must establish baseline metrics for establishing and monitoring the end-user experience for Priority Initiatives performing in the VA infrastructure SoS. An example would be a user experiencing latency in a Priority Initiative patient care application that is interfacing with a legacy system, or other Priority Initiative. The VA needs to understand baseline performance measures across the full user workflow and be able to compare current degraded performance against that baseline to determine where system issues are occurring.

Monitoring Change: A core activity of SoSE is to anticipate changes outside the control of the SoS that could affect the functionality or performance of an SoS capability. Priority Initiatives evolve independently of the SoS. Understanding the impact of change permits intervention to forestall problems or to implement mitigation strategies.
OTI functions of interest in this area: Configuration Management, Action Management
Notional Scope: The VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act of 2018 seeks to strengthen VA s ability to deliver trusted, easy to access, high quality care at VA facilities, virtually through telehealth, and in your community. VA MISSION Act, https://missionact.va.gov/, accessed September 5, 2019.
 This Act introduces potential changes, such as a necessary system upgrade, that might not go through traditional analysis during system planning stage. The SoSE needs to understand the impacts on other systems in the SoS regarding these changes, working in compressed timelines.

Developing and Evolving SoS Architecture: A key part of the SoSE task is to establish a persistent technical framework for planning, analyzing, and addressing the evolution of the SoS to meet user needs, including possible changes in systems functionality, performance or interfaces. This involves modeling the priority initiatives and showing how they currently relate to one another, possibly through the perspective of the customer. The current architecture is then evaluated against the performance measures to identify gaps and issues which may warrant action. Modeling with analysis might support this step. This core element does not address the details of the individual Priority Initiatives; rather, it defines the way the Priority Initiatives work together to meet Veteran and VA employee needs and addresses the implementation of Priority Initiatives, only when the functionality is key to crosscutting issues of the VA enterprise SoS.  In the future, this would need to include consideration of Veteran Benefits Administration (VBA) systems and functions and a broader set of functions that serve the Veterans.  
OTI functions of interest in this area: Technical Requirements Management, Technical Planning, Risk Management, Configuration Management, Data Management, and Interface Management
Notional Scope: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is committed to providing seamless care for Veterans, including access to a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR). VA EHR Modernization, accessed August 15, 2019, https://www.ehrm.va.gov/ 
 In order to support the Veteran s transition from the Department of Defense (DoD) to the VA healthcare system, a medical record that can also transition with minimal Veteran action improves the Veterans experience. Data interoperability is a critical component of that journey and requires technical collaboration on standards and processes between DoD and VA. OTI seeks to establish collaboration and building a VA and DoD strategy for data interoperability between the two strategic partners.

Addressing Requirements and Solution Options: This core element addresses the actions identified in Developing and Evolving SoS Architecture. Options must balance needs of the systems and the SoS. 
OTI functions of interest in this area: Technical Requirements Management, Enterprise Schedule Management, Site Readiness (Infrastructure) Technical Integration, and Configuration Change Management 
Notional Scope: Priority initiatives implement changes various user workflows. These changes require training and understanding the climate for change, unique to each facility and group of users. The SoSE needs to be able to understand the change and its impact on the SoS, especially considering multiple systems implementing changes on similar user groups simultaneously. The SoSE analyzes the environment and SoS for enterprise change risks and works with key stakeholders, such as OEI and VHA, to recommend approaches to address the risk. 

Orchestrating Upgrades: This core element implements the options selected in Addressing Requirements and Solution Options core element. Selected options must be funded, planned, contractually enabled, facilitated, integrated, and tested within the SoS. Constituent systems make the changes, but the SoSE orchestrates the process, coordinating, integrating, and testing across the SoS. The SoSE assesses performance after implementation. 
OTI functions of interest in this area: Integrated Risk Management and Configuration Change Management
Notional Scope: As the priority initiatives undergo upgrades, the SoSE needs to analyze impacts on the VA SoS. Upgrades for one system may have positive or negative impacts on other systems. These must be analyzed from cost, schedule, and performance perspectives. The SoSE must be able to convey the impacts qualitatively and quantitatively to the necessary business and technical organizations.

<DESC>This acquisition was a sole-source to FCN to purchase AssetVue brand name products. IRS procured hardware/supplies, Software licensing and maintenance, and support services in support of the radio frequency identification (RFID) Project. <br /><br />The Asset Vue suite of software is the only commercial off-the-shelf software specifically designed for use in the computer room environment that leverages RFID scanning technology. The AssetVue product is unique among all other asset tracking products because the AssetVue product suite is designed specifically for IT computer room / data center environment and provides data center specific information of the IT assets in the computer room and associates that information with managing the environment. The AssetVue software tracks the relationship among the hardware assets and the physical build configuration within the computer room to the exact location (down to the blade, or drive bay). This enables IRS respond to trouble reports more quickly and efficiently. It also enables the agency to measure and manage resource utilization such as space and power demand/distribution. The agency will also improve its financial accountability responsibilities by accurately tracking and reporting asset status, resolving several weaknesses identified in TIGTA audits.<br /><br />The&nbsp; contractor, FCN, is the only Assetvue reseller. Assetvue developed and owns the propriety and patented software and algorithms that are used in these products and support the services specifically required for this acquisition; therefore, the proposed vendor is the only source for Assetvue's unique products, technically knowledgeable staff and ancillary resources required for this acquisition.

<p>(2)	Going forward, all new entities registering in GSA's System for Award Management (SAM), as well as existing registrations being updated or renewed, will require the submission of an original, signed notarized letter identifying the authorized Entity Administrator for the entity associated with the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  Effective June 11, 2018, entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov to apply only for federal assistance opportunities such as grants, loans, and other financial assistance programs, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  Additionally, Effective June 29, 2018, all non-Federal entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  It is recommended that all interested parties be aware that processing this additional information may take several days and are proactive in maintaining the SAM registrations in an "Active" status as the government cannot award to an entity without an "Active" SAM registration.

The new centerwell and overside dragheads must be compatible with the dimensions of the existing dragarms and designed within the parameters of the existing dragheads. The parts required are protected under proprietary agreement and must be obtained from IHC of America. The Government does not possess the detailed drawings for the components required for fabrication of new parts. Use of any other parts would be impractical and would require extensive modification of the vessel. Consequently, without access or rights to this technical data by the Government or others, substitute sources for replacement parts do not exist.</p>
