<p>The upland mine requirements include, but are not limited to, the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. GRAIN SIZE<br />Interested vendors must provide information (laboratory test results etc) related to their facilities tested sediment grain size distribution. In general, the mine needs to be able to produce a range of roughly 0.25-0.65 mm. Sand may be processed but not manufactured. The sand mine needs to be able to reduce the % fines to less than 2%. The material needs to be comprised of either quartz or carbonate. Gravel-sized material will be regulated and will probably be limited to 5% or less.<br />Interested vendors shall provide information regarding their facilities tested range of sand Munsell colors.</p>
<p>2. OPERATIONAL CAPACITY<br />Interested vendors must provide average production rates to demonstrate ability to supply to large scale beach nourishment jobs (for example 300kcy in 250 days). <br />Interested vendors must submit information documenting their facility is capable of filling 150 to 350 trucks per day for delivery to beach nourishment projects. <br />Interested vendors must submit information related to facility stockpiling, washing procedures, and overall staging of sorted material.</p>
<p>3. PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS<br />Interested vendors shall provide any and all Department of Army permits and Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) permits, if acquired. If not acquired, provide estimate timeframes for acquisition and any active permit numbers associated with the action.</p>
<p><br />USACE anticipates developing and issuing a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) document that includes all potential viable upland mine sources for future renourishment needs in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. Interested Vendors</p>
<p>This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only and for the development of NEPA documents and is to allow industry the opportunity to submit responses describing their relevant capabilities for providing upland beach quality sand. While it is not USACE's intent to publicly disclose any proprietary information obtained from this Request, respondents should make best efforts to limit the inclusion of proprietary information in its response. Information expressly identified or marked by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential to the full extent possible pursuant to the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. &sect; 1905), Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C 552 et seq.) and other applicable federal laws and regulations. It is emphasized that this Request is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual or other form of agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating the ability to perform the above functions.</p>
<p>Interested parties should include, but not limited to, a capability statement; information about current or previous similar work, and if it was conducted on a government project, and any potential concerns or risks that you have encountered.</p>

In the course of the<br />hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity<br />to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax<br />court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely<br />payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not<br />currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action<br />is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

In determining the best value to the Government, the combined non-cost/price factors are equally important to the cost/price factor. The Quoters are advised that the quotation meeting the solicitation requirements with the lowest price may not be selected for award if award to a higher priced Quoter is determined to be more advantageous to the Government.

assess whether the quote is complete and accurate, and to minimize performance risk.
The total
contract price will be calculated by adding the totals of the base year and all option years.

Rating Methods:
The Technical factor will be rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. In order to be considered acceptable, the quotation must meet the minimum country requirements for service(s), direct dialing, and automatic roaming.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Past Performance and Technical when combined are more important than Price.
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Addendum To FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (OCT 2014)
The Government intends to award without discussions however; the Government retains the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary. Offerors are urged to ensure that their quote is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best potential could result in exclusion of the quote from further consideration. Failure to include all required documentation as required in this RFQ, may result in your submission being found to be technically unacceptable and removed from further consideration. 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Offerors who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
Proposals will be evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. Each non-cost factor will be rated acceptable/unacceptable. To receive consideration for award, a rating of acceptable must be achieved for technical and past performance.

FACTOR 1: Past Performance Evaluation Approach
FACTOR 2: Technical Evaluation Approach: Granite Samples & Qualifications
