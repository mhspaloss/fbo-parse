<p>The Navy Watercraft Afloat Maintenance Services (NWAMS) contract will be an indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity type contract with task orders issued annually for preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance and other support.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The NAVFAC Expeditionary Programs Office (NEPO), Sealift Support Office is responsible for Navy equipment assigned to the Maritime Prepositioned Force (MPF). The MPF consists of forward deployed ships in Guam, Diego Garcia, and Saipan carrying NEPO equipment. NEPO's equipment is used in training exercises and contingencies and which must remain operationally ready. This requires timely maintenance and repairs of Navy watercraft staged onboard the MPF ships positioned OCONUS. The Navy Branch at BICmd executes maintenance and logistical oversight of NEPO equipment.</p>
<p>MPF Maintenance Cycles (MMCs) have historically occurred in a 36-40 month cycle. After a newly loaded ship departs Blount Island Command (BIC), Florida, it will stay in its assigned theater for approximately 34 to 36 months before returning to BIC to offload for a scheduled shipyard availability.</p>
<p>The MPF currently consists of Marine Prepositioning Squadron (MPS) Squadron Two, located at Diego Garcia; and MPS Squadron Three, in the Guam/Saipan area. These MPF squadrons together consist of ten prepositioned ships configured to transport supplies for the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Equipment requiring maintenance and repair is stored on the weather decks of deployed MPF ships. These subject systems are the Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS), Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS), Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM-8s), and Maritime Prepositioning Force Utility Boat (MPFUBs). The Lighter, Amphibious, Resupply Cargo (LARC) is staged in the interior of the assigned MPS.</p>
<p>Every three years, MPF ships return to the Continental United States for major maintenance and supply refreshment. This cycle is called the MPF Maintenance Cycle (MC) and is held at the Blount Island Command (BIC).</p>
<p>The Navy watercraft are staged onboard the MPS for use by the Naval Beach Groups (NBGs) One and Two (located in Coronado, CA and Little Creek, VA respectively) In Support Of (ISO) exercises and contingencies. The contractor maintains custody and performs maintenance of ABLTS, INLS, LCM-8s, LARC and MPF UBs onboard the ship while the equipment is not under the operational control of the NBGs, which is the majority of time. They will assist with periodic inspections and will manage custody transfer of the equipment, when directed. Between the two MPS squadrons, there are 12 ships. Ten of the twelve MPS currently have Navy watercraft assigned and embarked except during rotation through BIC for the MMC.</p>
<p>The projected watercraft assignments per ship is listed below (Warping Tugs (WT), Causeway Ferries (CF), and Roll-On/Roll-Off Discharge Facility (RRDF) are INLS components, described further below)</p>
<p>*MPS Two (located in Diego Garcia):<br />-USNS Button: 1xWT, 2xCF, 1xMPFUB and 1xABLTS.<br />-USNS Lopez: 1xWT, 3xCF, 1xMPFUB and 1xABLTS.<br />-<br />-USNS Seay: 1xWT, 3xCF, 1xLCM8, 2xLARC and 2xMPF UB.<br />-USNS Sisler: 1xWT, 3xCF and 1xMPFUB.<br />-USNS Williams: 1xWT, 1xRRDF, 1xLCM8, 1xMPFUB, 2xLARC and 1xABLTS.</p>
<p>*MPS Three (located in Guam/Saipan):<br />-USNS Lummus: 1xWT, 2xCF, 1xMPFUB and 1xABLTS.<br />-USNS Stockham: 1xWT, 3xCF, 1xLCM8 and 1xMPFUB.<br />-USNS Bobo: 1xWT, 1xRRDF, 1xLCM8, 1xMPFUB, 2xLARC and 1xABLTS.<br />-USNS Dahl: 1xWT, 3xCF and 1xMPFUB.<br />-USNS Pililaau: 1xWT, 3xCF, 1xLCM8, 2xLARC and 2xMPFUB.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs describe the equipment and systems that require maintenance.</p>
<p>Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS)<br />ABLTS is a reel-laid buoyant hose system for fuel or water transfer. The system has a total of three hose reels. Two of the reels are capable of deploying 5,000 feet of 6-inch fuel hose. The third hose reel has 10,000 feet of 4-inch potable water hose.</p>
<p>Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS)<br />The INLS is a system of steel modules that are interconnected by rigid and flexible connections. These modules are used to construct causeway ferries and Roll-On/Roll-Off Discharge Facilities for the loading and unloading of material from ships to shore. The individual non-powered modules are nominally 80' long, 24' wide, and 8' deep. The individual modules can be assembled to form specific platforms. The 3 INLS platforms assigned to MPF are:<br />&bull; Warping Tug (WT)<br />&bull; Causeway Ferry (CF)<br />o Consists of the Causeway Ferry Power Module (CFPM, Intermediate Module (IM) and Beach Module (BM)<br />&bull; Roll-On/Roll-Of Discharge Facility (RRDF)<br />o A system of 9 non-powered modules including 7 Combination Modules (CM), 1 Docking Module (DM) and 1 Ramp Module (RM); also included are side connectors to attach them together and a Containerized Crew Shelter (CCS)<br />Listed below are the major individual components that make up INLS:</p>
<p>Warping Tug<br />The Warping Tug (WT) is a single powered module used to assist and support other INLS platforms and operations. The WT operates independent of all other modules. It assists in platform assembly, disassembly, ABLTS installation, anchor deployment and retrieval, salvage, towing, station keeping and other tasks in support of a full range of operations. WTs are 87'9" long, 24' wide, 8' deep and weigh approximately 111 Long Tons (LT) as loaded on the MPF ships (with 25% fuel onboard).</p>
<p>Causeway Ferry Power Module<br />The Causeway Ferry Power Module (CFPM) is one of the modules that make up the Causeway Ferry (CF) platform. The CFPM provides primary propulsion and control for the Causeway Ferry which is assembled using one CFPM, one Intermediate Module (IM) and 1 Beach Module (BM). In addition to propulsion and control, the CFPM provides the stern drive through capability, cargo deck space, along with the other CF modules, for loading, securing and transportation of cargo. CFPMs are 87'7" long, 24' wide, 8' deep and weigh approximately 107 LT as loaded on the MPF ships (with 25% fuel onboard).</p>
<p>Intermediate Module<br />The Intermediate Module (IM) is a non-powered module that is used in the assembly of the CF. The IM has flexor connectors fore and aft so that it can be connected with other modules end to end. IMs are 80' long, 24' wide, 8' deep, and weigh approximately 69 LT.</p>
<p>Beach Module<br />The Beach Module (BM) is one of two powered modules that together with an IM make up the CF. The BM bow thruster provides assisted maneuvering of the CF. and is controlled wirelessly from the CFPM. In addition to the bow thruster, the BM provides a hydraulically operated ramp to enable drive-on or drive-off capabilities for the rolling cargo to the beach. BMs are 89'10.75" long, 24' wide, 8' deep and weigh approximately 90 LT as loaded on the MPF ships (with 25% fuel onboard).</p>
<p>Combination Module<br />The Combination Module (CM) is a non-powered module. The CM is the primary module making of the RRDF platform (7 CMs are used). The CM has flexor connectors fore and aft so that it can be connected with other CMs, IMs, RMs, or DMs end to end. In addition, the CM has side connector pockets so that it can be connected side to side with other CMs and DMs using hydraulically operated side connectors. The side connectors are positioned in the female housings on each side of the CM and activated (locked) hydraulically. CMs are 80' long, 24' wide, 8' deep, and weigh approximately 77 LT without side connectors.</p>
<p>Docking Module<br />The Docking Module (DM) is similar to the CM in dimensions, with the addition of a fixed angle ramp on one end. The DM is provided with female side connector recesses that are configured identically to the side connector recesses of the CM. Like the CM, the housings are used for rigid attachment to other CMs comprising a RRDF. The end of the DM that mates with the CFPM has a roadway that slopes to meet the deck of the CFPM and connects to the CFPM by means of the Flexible Connector System. The connection system is designed to provide a secure engagement during vehicle transfer operations. DMs are 80' long, 24' wide, 8' deep, and weigh approximately 78 LT.</p>
<p>Ramp Module<br />The Ramp Module (RM) is a non-powered module that is used in the assembly of the RRDF. The RM facilitates the loading and unloading of other displacement landing craft/Lighterage such as the Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM8), Landing Craft and Utility (LCU). RMs are 80' long, 24' wide, 8' deep, and weigh approximately 62 LT.</p>
<p>Containerized Crew Shelter<br />The Containerized Crew Shelter (CCS) provides habitability, communication, and stowage for personnel assigned to the RRDF. It is provided with a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system that maintain the interior habitability at 60oF to 85oF. The CCS is divided into three primary spaces. The diesel generator space and the Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU)/storage space share one end of the container and are separated by an inner wall. These two spaces occupy approximately one third of the 20 foot container. The crew room occupies the rest of the container. The CCS weighs approximately 15 LT.</p>
<p>Side Connector<br />The INLS Side Connector (SC) System consists of two major assemblies - the Male-to-Male Connector and the Remote Control Station Cart Assembly. The main purpose of the connector is to provide a means of side connecting the INLS CMs to form a rigid connection in the assembly of larger platforms. SCs are also used to connect a DM with a CM. The connectors mate with female pockets located on the side of each CM/DM. The individual connectors are installed in three of the seven CMs per RRDF and the Remote Cart is installed in the CCS. Side Connectors weigh 4200 pounds each.</p>
<p>Landing Craft, Mechanized (LCM-8)<br />LCM-8s have been in the fleet since 1959 transporting cargo, troops and vehicles between ships and shore and also performing lighter and utility work in harbors. The LCM-8 is designed for use in rough or exposed waters and can be operated through breakers and grounded on the beach. The hydraulically operated bow ramp allows RORO operations with wheeled and tracked vehicles. LCM-8s are 73'7" long, 21'1" wide, have a draft of 4'7" and weigh approximately 75 LT.</p>
<p>Maritime Prepositioning Force Utility Boat (MPF UB)<br />MPFUBs were designed to transfer personnel and their associated equipment (30 people with 150 lbs. of equipment each), cargo (10,000 lbs.), and waterborne medical evacuations between ships and shore as well as provide protection and security in the area of operations. MPFUBs are 41'1" long, 14'6" wide, have a draft of 2'6" and weigh approximately 11 LT.</p>
<p>2.1 Compliance Requirements</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to comply with all U.S. and international law. This includes but is not limited to, international trade, customs, labor, and environmental laws, for all personnel and operations.</p>
<p>3.0 Scope</p>
<p>This requirement is needed to execute OCONUS Navy Watercraft Afloat Maintenance Services ISO the US Marine Corps Maritime Prepositioning Force Program. The Contractor's Program Manager will be responsible for overall management of the contract. The Program Manager shall be the single point of contact for all matters pertaining to the performance of the contract and will be the Program Manager's primary duty.</p>
<p>This requirement includes support services in the following two service areas:</p>
<p>Service Area I - Afloat Preventive Maintenance and associated logistics support. This service area is critical to ensuring that the Navy Watercraft remain full mission capable. The tasks within this service area provide continuous OCONUS Preventive Maintenance (PM) IAW a Government provided Maintenance Requirements Package (MRP), which details maintenance tasks and periodicities. PM is performed in the afloat environment on Navy watercraft stage onboard MPF ships with performance of preventive maintenance subject to MPS schedule and MPS crew activities. PM is not performed during the MPS rotation through BICmd. PM will require dedicated employees for each MPS that are responsible for and maintain custody of the assigned Navy watercraft. PM will also require dedicated employees with specific skill sets be assigned to each squadron to support all MPS in that squadron. The Contractor employees work and live onboard the MPS.</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to, the following Navy watercraft: Maritime Prepositioning Force Utility Boat (MPFUB), Lighter, Amphibious, Resupply Cargo (LARC), Landing Craft Mechanized-8 (LCM-8), ABLTS and Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS), which includes: Warping Tug (WT), Causeway Ferry Power Module, Causeway Ferry Beach Module, Causeway Ferry Intermediate Module and the Roll On/Roll Off Discharge Facility (RRDF) system which includes the Docking Module, Ramp Module and Combination Module, Containerized Crew Shelter (CCS) and RRDF Side Connector system (SC) staged on MPF shipping, deployed overseas. The MRP Standard Work Items (SWI) tasks consist of preventive maintenance for the INLS, LCM-8, MPF UB and ABLTS systems once they are placed aboard the MPF Ships. Type of maintenance includes specific maritime disciplines such as electrical, mechanical, electronic, corrosion control and boat equipage. This service area does not include CONUS based maintenance services as these services are performed under a different BICmd contract.</p>
<p>Service Area II - Afloat Corrective Maintenance and associated logistics support. This service area is critical to ensuring that the Navy Watercraft are full mission capable. The repair work required is normally unscheduled/unknown but is continuous and ongoing as a result of a robust exercise schedule and is contingent upon the following factors: watercraft access and availability, weather, mission, exercise schedule, and shipboard activities. Examples of scheduling challenges are ship movement from homeport for ship crew proficiency training, Military Sealift Command (MSC) controlled. Ship movement in support of MPF exercises, Combatant Command (COCOM) controlled. Ship movement for inclement weather sortie, MSC controlled and ship crew performing various ship maintenance or preservation operations that may impede the contractor from simultaneously working on the embarked watercraft. The items listed above all have priority over lighterage maintenance, which severely restricts the Prime Contractor's window of opportunity to perform needed repairs. This is further exasperated when the lighterage onboard receives damage during an exercise as it significantly increases the workload in an already restricted window.</p>
<p>The tasks within this service area provide OCONUS Intermediate and Depot Level Repair and associated logistic support services. Maintenance requirements for this service area normally result from exercise damage or "growth" work from preventive maintenance covered in Service area I above. Some repairs may be emergent in nature, requiring immediate repair. Routine repairs in the afloat environment are subject to MPF shipping schedules. This includes, but is not limited to, the following Navy watercraft: Maritime Prepositioning Force Utility Boat (MPFUB), Lighter, Amphibious, Resupply Cargo (LARC), Landing Craft Mechanized-8 (LCM-8), ABLTS and Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS), which includes: Warping Tug (WT), Causeway Ferry Power Module, Causeway Ferry Beach Module, Causeway Ferry Intermediate Module and the Roll On/Roll Off Discharge Facility (RRDF) system which includes the Docking Module, Ramp Module and Combination Module, Containerized Crew Shelter (CCS) and RRDF Side Connector system (SC) staged on MPF shipping, deployed overseas. The tasks consist of corrective maintenance and repair of the INLS, LCM-8, MPF UB, LCM8 and ABLTS systems once they are placed aboard the MPF Ships. Type of work includes various ship repair disciplines, but not limited to, hull cleaning, , minor steel fabrication, shipfitter, welding, mechanical, machining, piping, hydraulics, electrical, electronic, selective paint surface conditioning, selective coating systems (painting/non skidding). Depending on the severity of damage, depot level repair may require watercraft removal from the ship for OCONUS dry docking. It may also include priority short notice selective repairs or upgrades to Navy watercraft. This service area does not include CONUS based maintenance services as these services are performed under a different BICmd contract.</p>

The Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to award on a sole source basis an open market contract to Iradimed Corporation   1025 Willa Springs Dr Winter Springs, FL 32708-5235-- as the only responsible source to provide contract performance.   This Small Business (Iradimed Corporation -  Duns 170301969) can provide contract action to Edward Hines Jr. VA Medical Center, 5000 South 5th Ave, Hines, IL 60141-5000.  Currently, this company is the only company who can provide operation based on specific salient characteristics needed at this VA Medical Center.  Iradimed Corporation provides an MRI Infusion Pump; one that has a non-magnetic design.  This alone allows this MRI infusion pump to operate safely in ultra-high magnetic fields without the need for workarounds used with traditional infusion pumps. For critical patients, allowing infusion of medication to be continuous within the MRI room allows continuity of infusion fluids during transports, expedited MRI Diagnosis and reduced risk of misconnections and drug mixings.  This MRI also negates the possibility of blood stream infections, maintains the infusion medication tube flow to patient and stops post occlusion boluses.  This can happen when subsequent manipulation of multiple connections and access ports occur.  This MRI infusion pump stays connected to the critical patient 24-7, even when in the MRI.  The Contracting Officer also found that the  Original Equipment Manufacturer confirmed and provided a letter that only they can provide this item and they do not use distributors for this MRI Infusion pump. 

This procurement is a sole-source open market procurement under FAR 13.106-3(2).  The applicable NAICS Code is 339112 (surgical and medical instrument manufacturing) and the size standard is 1000 employees. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation or a solicitation of offers. However, all quotes received within three days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement upon receipt of response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. There will be no solicitation available.

Please contact Shari Lee, at shari.lee@va.gov for any questions or concerns.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden “compliance with the boycott”, and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)’s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above: SEE CONTINUATION below<BR><BR>(a) General.

<p>This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach.</p>
<p>(b) Government Reporting Provisions</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us- cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html.<br />The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the US- CERT office.</p>
<p>The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.</p>
<p>When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text.<br />Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances.</p>
<p>In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed.</p>
<p>(c) Individual Notification Provisions</p>
<p>If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.</p>
<p>The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been breached.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll-free, e-mail address and postal address) for obtaining more information.</p>
<p>Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g., "Data Breach Information Enclosed," and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the breach. The letter must also include contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal address.</p>
<p>If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach, some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in accordance with Privacy Office approval.</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for addressing.</p>
<p>Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate finds that a cyber security incident involves a PII/PHI breach (suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as determined by DoD/DHA.</p>
<p>V. Termination<br />(a) Termination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Effect of Termination.</p>
<p>(1) If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below. If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement provisions or DHA direction.</p>
<p>(2) If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Business Associate. The Business Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI.</p>
<p>(3) If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI.<br />VI. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>(a) Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the DoD HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p>TOBACCO FREE MEDICAL CAMPUS (TFMC)</p>
<p>In accordance with Army Regulation 600-63, paragraph 7-3, 14 April 2015; Operations Order 15-48 (Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) Tobacco Free Living - USAMEDCOM), 8 May 2015; and any Operations Order, regulation or other instruction implementing, defining or otherwise addressing the Tobacco Free Medical Campus (TFMC) on any military installation or DoD-controlled location, Contractor personnel are prohibited from using any tobacco product on or within any TFMC while performing under this contract.<br />TFMCs are established at each installation or DoD-controlled location and include: (1) any property or non- residential building that is operated, maintained or assigned to support medical activities, including but not limited to, hospitals, medical laboratories, outpatient clinics (including medical, dental, and veterinary facilities), or aid stations operating for the primary purpose of delivering medical care and services for DOD eligible beneficiaries and /or meeting the mission of the Army Medical Command; (2) all other facilities in which medical activities or administration take place, to include HQ MEDCOM and Defense Health Headquarters; (3) all internal roadways, sidewalks and parking lots; and (4) all sidewalks, parking lots and grounds external but adjacent to the building or related to the migratory corridors surrounding the medical facility.

<p>Exclusion from Participation in Federal Health Care Programs (October 2015)</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall not employ or contract with any individual or entity (hereinafter collectively referred to as "person") to provide items or services that will be included in invoices submitted to the Government under this contract if such person is listed on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) or the TRICARE Sanctioned Provider List. The Government is legally prohibited from paying for provision of items or services by such persons. The prohibition extends to services beyond direct patient care, such as services of persons in executive or leadership roles and administrative and management services, whether or not such services are billed separately. The LEIE may be found at http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/exclusions.asp, and the TRICARE Sanctioned Provider list at http://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Access-Cost-Quality-and- Safety/Quality-And-Safety-of-Healthcare/Program-Integrity/Sanctioned-Providers. The LEIE and TRICARE Sanctioned Provider List are hereinafter collectively referred to as "the Lists."</p>
<p>2. Prior to start of contract performance, the Contractor shall (a) query the Lists to determine whether the name of any person the Contractor employs or contracts with to provide services or items for which payment may be made under this contract appears on the Lists, and (b) certify to the Contracting Officer that the Contractor has queried the Lists and no such names appear on either of the Lists.</p>
<p>3. During performance of the contract, and prior to persons other than those whose names were queried in accordance with paragraph 2, above, (hereinafter "new persons") providing services or items under the contract, the Contractor shall (a) query the Lists as in paragraph 2, and (b) certify to the Contracting Officer that the names of such new persons do not appear on either of the Lists.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor is advised that during performance of the contract, MTF personnel will perform a recurrent recheck of the names of contractor personnel working in the MTF against the Lists, as specified in OTSG/MEDCOM Policy Memo 15-037. The Government will notify the Contractor in the event any contractor personnel working in the MTF appear on either of the Lists.</p>
<p>5. Should any person providing items or services under the contract appear on either of the Lists at any time during contract performance, the Contractor shall (a) in cases where the Contractor identified the person, notify the Contracting Officer, and (b) promptly remove that person from the contract.</p>
<p>6. Violation of any aspect of the above paragraphs shall be considered a material breach of the contract and may result in termination of the contract.</p>

<p>b. Billing under the contract for provision of items or services by a person on either List may also result in exclusion of the person that employs or contracts with such person.</p>
<p>8. HHS OIG has issued a Special Advisory Bulletin on the Effect of Exclusion from Participation in Federal Health Care Programs with additional information on the CMP. The Special Advisory Bulletin may be found at http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/files/sab-05092013.pdf.</p>
