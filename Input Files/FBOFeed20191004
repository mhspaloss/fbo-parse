<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. The NIAID supports resources and services to assist academic, small business and other investigators, including contracts that provide or make available research materials, in vitro drug screening, chemical synthesis including small scale Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) synthesis, small animal efficacy models, drug formulation, preclinical pharmacology and toxicology, and other discovery and preclinical services to aid the advancement of promising agents from bench to clinics. Over the past years, these contract activities have helped investigators to obtain critical data and materials to attract additional funding, gain prospective partnership, fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies before entering clinical trials. Information about these contract resources or activities can be found at the following website: <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources">https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these activities are currently being provided under the following NIAID contracts:</p>
<p>&bull; AIDS Reagent Program (HHSN272201200022C with Fisher Bioservices, Inc. 14665 Rothgeb Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20850)</p>

The parking lot will be on the north side of Building 31 and extend to H Road. It is bounded by 6th Street to the east and the OPS Center parking lot to the west (Bay 31H). The site is partially developed as a gravel parking lot. A large berm is located on the north side of the site and was created during the demolition of Warehouse 30. The berm is located comprised of concrete and brick rubble (estimated at 50% by volume), with fill and topsoil. The berm does not contain hazardous material. The berm section is approximately 9' high, 45' across the top and 100' across the bottom. A geothermal well field exists under the existing gravel parking which must be maintained in the design as well as during construction. Building 31 is considered an occupied building and AT/FP setbacks apply. I Road is currently acting as the entrance to the parking area and will be completely removed by this project.

<p>3.1 Performance Metrics: Briefly describe industry and commercial standards your organization currently employs to measure performance? How would you apply or adapt these metrics to measure performance for services described in the PWS? Are there additional or new quality indicators within the healthcare industry that would strengthen the PWS?</p>
<p>3.2 Business Model: Provide a general overview of how your business structure would accommodate billing for up to 75 MTF's located throughout the United States and Overseas. For planning purposes, estimations should be based on at least 1.5 million outpatient and 2,000 inpatient claims per year. In your business model description, include the specific resource allocation you propose, i.e. locate billing personnel at each MTF, establish a vendor hosted, centralized billing hub, employ a hybrid/combination of the two methods, or other. Provide the rational for your approach. Responses should include the ability to remotely access Department of Defense systems as well as the possibility remote access will not be available. Responses to this RFI should also include your organizations current and planned methodologies for other health insurance (OHI) discovery?

<p>3.4 Contract Type: To ensure timely and complete follow-up collection activities occur under the proposed contract, briefly describe reimbursement methodologies you recommend to incentivize performance? What industry practices are currently used to maximize collections and reduce collection time? Previous methods employed by the AFMS focused on reimbursements based on a percentage of payments collected for billed claims.

You may reference the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 16, for specific guidance. Paragraph 2.1 in the attached PWS describes a possible method of reimbursement and includes the definition of a "completed claim." Is the definition clear and easily understood? If not, what details or information should we include to ensure a mutually agreed upon understanding of the phrase, "completed claim"?</p>
<p>3.5 Security: Describe how your organization secures patient data and protects against unauthorized disclosure. Can you recommend areas for improvement or necessary changes within the attached PWS to appropriately align our security requirements with current industry standards?</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) is seeking information for industry interest and capability to support a limited production of a government designed prototype of a cold weather face and head protection system that meets military requirements for operating in cold to intense cold weather conditions (+20&deg;F to -25&deg;F). The system will consist of a balaclava and removable facemask for additional face protection and goggle integration.
<p>The RFI is issued solely for information gathering and planning purposes. The RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals and will not directly lead to any contract awards. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest as well as instructions for the submission of responses. <br /><br />Background &amp; Scope:<br />In winter 2018-2019, PM SCIE evaluated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf cold weather balaclavas and head/face protection systems. These evaluations identified capability gaps in the current COTS market offerings relative to dismounted and mounted Soldier training and operational needs for cold and extreme cold environmental conditions. As a result, PM SCIE has worked with Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center (CCDC SC) to develop Government designed solutions and is seeking manufacturers to produce prototypes for evaluation in winter 2019-2020.</p>
<p>The prototype system is designed to be compatible with current and future clothing and equipment to include the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), the Extended Cold Weather Clothing System (ECWCS) garments, and cold weather goggles authorized through the Army Approved Product List (APL). The system is expected to be easily donned and doffed. The system shall be able to transition between cold-wet (i.e. +20&deg;F) to the intense cold (i.e. -25&deg;F). The system is expected to have a service life of at least 120-days under combat/field use. The system shall be subdued in shade, so as to be compatible with current camouflage patterns. Illustrations, patterns, and pictures will be provided by the Government prior to any award or order. Government patterns shall be provided in electronic format in a recent Gerber AccuMark version. For contractors without access to compatible AccuMark CAD and/or plotting capabilities utilizing a 2nd party pattern service for pattern conversion and/or plotting is recommended.</p>

<p>300 each Facemasks (design 1): Neoprene fabric; elastic binding; 0.15" diameter PTFE rods or similar; malleable 16G wire; and elastic webbing</p>
<p>300 each Facemasks (design 2): Neoprene fabric; elastic binding; 0.15" diameter PTFE rods or similar; malleable 16G wire; and hook-and-loop attachment points</p>

<RESPDATE>102519
<CONTACT>Heather M. Skorik, Contracting Specialist, Phone 9783188040, Email heather.skorik@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Description:
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (CENAE) is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for Environmental Remediation Dredging of tidal flats and an outfall drainage channel in the Housatonic River adjacent to the Stratford Army Engine Plant, Stratford, Connecticut. The purpose of this announcement is to determine interest, availability, and capability of Small Business and Large Business concerns to perform the work and to determine if a Best Value or Invitation for Bid (IFB) approach is in the best interest of the Government. The NAICS code for the work described below is 562910. CENAE plans to award this project using a design-bid-build model, with the issued for bid (100%) design to be issued on or about November 2020. The construction is expected to take 18 months. The estimated construction cost is between $50,000,000.00 and $60,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Work consists of environmental remediation via mechanical dredging of the tidal flats and an outfall drainage channel adjacent to the Stratford Army Engine Plant to remediate metals and PCBs affected sediments. Approximately 140,000 cubic yards (cy) of material need to be removed from the tidal flats and an additional 5,000 cy from the drainage channel. Dredged material must be dewatered, solidified with cementitious materials, and placed on-site for future beneficial re-use. A small portion of this material requires off-site disposal at RCRA D (solid waste) and TSCA approved landfills. This material will require segregation during dredging. The tidal flats will require backfilling with sand material and restoration of a relatively small area of salt marsh.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The selected contractor will need to meet precise dredge target elevations (overdredge allowance will be approximately 4 inches). Dredging, placement of material into scows, dewatering, water treatment/discharge, transfer of material into trucks, and depositing of material onsite must be performed with minimal spillage or turbidity. Measures will be required to minimize the spread of contaminated sediments and contain turbidity. Deployment of a silt curtain will be required. Dredging is generally limited to depths below mudline of 1 to 4 ft, ranging in tidal water depths of 2 ft [high tide] to approximately 10 ft. Dredged material must be segregated into three categories for purposes of disposal/reuse characterization based upon PCB concentration (&lt;1 ppm, &gt;=1 to &lt;50 ppm, and &gt;= 50 ppm). Materials containing less than 1 ppm PCBs are suitable for on-site re-use. Materials containing greater than 1 ppm PCBs must be disposed of off-site at facilities licensed to accept these materials. All work must be completed within an 18-month continuous allowable work window.</p>
<p>Dredging accuracy will be key to minimizing the amount of over-dredging while still attaining the target cleanup goals of the project. The tidal flats dredging shall be performed using precision mechanical dredging methods. Sediments shall be dredged using a sealed environmental level cut bucket to limit the generation of resuspended sediments and overdredge required to meet project objectives. State-of-the-art monitoring and positioning systems are required to ensure the allowable overdredge can be achieved.</p>
<p>Turbidity measurements and comparison to project-specific standards (to be determined) will be required up- and downstream of the active work area. The dredging shall be performed in a careful, well-designed manner so that downstream project-generated turbidity is kept to a minimum, and when appropriate, actions may be required to reduce turbidity generation to maintain compliance.</p>
<p>The dredged sediment shall be dewatered and Portland cement added prior to onsite placement to meet strength and workability requirements for future reuse on the site.</p>
<p>Excavation of the drainage channel shall be performed "in the dry" by dewatering the channel and diverting storm and tidal flows. The drainage channel will require backfilling and restoration.</p>
<p>The tidal flats shall be backfilled to within one foot of original grade using a sand material. Saltmarsh restoration and establishment period monitoring, will be required for resource areas impacted by dredging operations under this contract.</p>
<p>The work requires compliance under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 including a Health and Safety Program, Site Specific Health and Safety Plan, and Training (40 Hour HAZWOPER and 8 Hour Refresher Training) for all onsite workers.</p>
<p>Capabilities and Approach:</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit an information package to include the following:</p>
<p>1. Business classification (i.e. HUBZone, small business, etc.).</p>
<p>2. Project Experience. To demonstrate its capabilities, an interested firm should provide information on projects with similar scope, volume of material dredged, dollar value, schedule constraints, and complexity performed in the last ten (10) years. Demonstration of the following elements will be most indicative of capability:</p>
<p>a) Precision environmental mechanical dredging using equipment similar to that specified above (including state-of-the-art monitoring and control systems for dredge accuracy) with the ability to meet required overdredge. Please include information about the dredging accuracy achieved, dredging control/guidance systems used, and hydrographic surveying methods used. Also include daily productivity rate.</p>
<p>b) Projects that operated on 24/7/365 schedules and projects that integrated the use of multiple floating plant operations to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>c) Projects that implemented a turbidity monitoring and management program, which included multiple trigger levels to reevaluate and modify dredging operations to meet project turbidity requirements. Include monitoring equipment used.</p>
<p>d) Sediment dewatering, stabilization with cementitious material, and land placement for purposes of developing material strength for reuse on site. Include dewatering methods and stabilization equipment that were used.</p>
<p>e) Include whether the firm was the prime or subcontractor(s) and what elements of work were performed by the firm.</p>
<p><br />3. Team Subcontractors and Their Roles. Indicate the team's major subcontractor(s), including their prior experience and qualifications, which will be used to support the effort.</p>
<p>4. Technical Approach Narrative. Provide a brief narrative (1-2 pages) describing the approach the firm would take to dredging, dewatering, water treatment, solidification, on-site placement of material, backfilling of the tidal flats and the drainage channel, and wetlands restoration.</p>
<p>5. Preferred Acquisition Approach. We are interested in the opinions of interested firms about the Government's method of procurement. We contemplate either an Invitation for Bids (sealed bidding) or Request for Proposals (best value award based on a technical and price tradeoffs). If you choose, please provide your opinion and explain why your preferred acquisition approach would result in the most successful execution of this project for the Government.</p>
<p>Page Limit: Responses are limited to twenty (20) pages.</p>
<p>Due Date: Responses are due by 25 October 2019. Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: Heather Skorik, or via email to heather.skorik@usace.army.mil. Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy, if mailed. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided. This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation. The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.</p>

If the entire Censis  GovCloud requirement, or an equivalent, outlined in the Product Description is available from your company under a General Services Administration (GSA) contract or other contract vehicle, please let us know in your response.
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes it does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.

Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.

Requirement

Real Time Location System (RTLS) is an umbrella term that includes multiple technologies for locating and tracking items. It includes Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) based location finding, active and passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and a number of other location technologies, including ultrasound (US) and infrared (IR). The potential uses and benefits of this technology throughout VA are significant, and include improvement of quality of patient care, improved patient satisfaction, reduction of health care asset management costs, improvement of capacity/resource planning, improvement of employee and patient safety, as well as improvement of general asset management and inventory.
Censis  tracking system, Censitrac, is used for tracking reusable medical devices through the workflow of Sterile Processing Services (SPS) from decontamination to the operating room. Censitrak works by scanning 2-D barcodes that are electro-chemically etched into the reusable medical devices. Standard barcodes are used for identifying instrument containers, case carts, peel packs, endoscopes, and locations and reprocessing.  In VISN 10 all eleven facilities use Censitrac for tracking their SPS workflow. The interface for the system is currently held in two different software applications depending on the location of the facility due to the merging of the Veterans in Partnership Healthcare Network (VISN 11) and the VA System of Ohio Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN 10).
NOTE: October 1, 2015 VA System of Ohio Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN 10) and the Veterans in Partnership Health care Network (VISN 11) integrated. The PWS includes the following facilities:
Ann Arbor, VA Medical Center (VAMC)  - Ann Arbor, Michigan

<p><strong>NAICS Code: 334515</strong> (Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals)</p>
<p>Please note that the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) In-Flight Interceptor Communication System Data Terminal (IDT) Antenna is related to GMD Future RFI Solicitation Number MDA19GMRFI02 as a component within the Ground System (GS) scope.<br /><br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Program is conducting market research to determine industry interest and capability for sources to perform in any of the following three areas:</p>
<p>I. Demonstrated capability and desire to design, develop, fabricate and test a phased array antenna to replace the existing In-Flight Interceptor Communication System Data Terminal (IDT) parabolic dish antenna and deliver two prototypes, targeting calendar year (CY) 2024 for delivery to a Government site for integration;<br /><br />II. Demonstrated capability and desire to "build-to-print" a phased array antenna or to complete the design of a Government provided Preliminary Design Review (PDR) level package for an antenna composed of solid state transmit/receive elements and deliver completed design. Demonstrate capability to deliver two antenna prototypes targeting CY2024 for delivery to a Government site for integration. A data package provided by the Government will contain all necessary documentation, specifications and drawings;<br /><br />III. Provide alternate concepts/designs for Government consideration that could be used to perform the IDT antenna mission and would allow delivery of two antenna prototypes targeting CY2024 for delivery to a Government site for integration.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of the overall market research activity to collect, organize, maintain, analyze, and present data in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. In addition, this RFI is intended to help MDA make informed acquisition decisions and business case analyses to:</p>
<p>a) Assess the current marketplace and existing industry capabilities to fulfill the GMD IDT Phased Array or other technology insertion requirements for IDT antennas;<br /><br />b) Obtain recommendations from industry on the contract type, contract duration/period of performance, acquisition strategies, and approaches (including contract and incentive structures) that are available to support GMD IDT requirements;<br /><br />c) Identify and assess the major risks to the acquisition and project execution; <br /><br />d) Identify and mitigate any potential barriers to competition;<br /><br />e) Determine industry data/information needs to support proposal preparations;<br /><br />f) Identify areas that could be set-aside for small business concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Program Background</strong><br />The GMD element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System provides Combatant Commanders the capability to engage and destroy intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile threats in space to protect the United States (U.S.). The GMD employs integrated communications networks, fire control systems, globally deployed sensors and Ground-Based Interceptors that are capable of detecting, tracking and destroying ballistic missile threats.

The ALC purchases a wide variety of aviation supplies and services and we are committed to small business participation in our acquisition programs to support the mission of the United States Coast Guard.
<p>The ALC posts its upcoming forecast of opportunities on the Acquisition Planning Forecast System (AFPS), which is a database that captures information regarding potential Department of Homeland Security (DHS) procurements. The Forecast allows industry, especially small businesses, the opportunity to view projections of all anticipated opportunities estimated to exceed $250,000 that small businesses may be able to perform under contracts with the ALC or perform part of the effort through subcontracts. APFS identifies upcoming forecasted, but not necessarily funded, opportunities at http://apfs.dhs .gov/ . Information on this site is organized in a manner to permit various data sorts, and the individual items include descriptions of required supplies or services. One way to search APFS is by NAICS Code. The most widely used NAICS Codes at ALC are 488190, 336413, 336412, 811219 and 541611.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Marketing Services (AMS) requests quotations from responsible sources to provide marine cargo discharge/delivery survey services in Niger.</p>
<p>The services will include surveys of containerized, bulk, and breakbulk commodities for food assistance programs. It is the intention of the Government to award a firm-fixed price contract to one firm.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Marketing Service procures staple foods for use in various international food aid programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The food is purchased in bulk and packaged form and transported overseas by ocean carriers to discharge ports or foreign inland destinations for delivery to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVO), or foreign governments. Given the inherent nature of transporting bulk and packaged food long distances by sea and overland in foreign nations, there is a potential for loss or damage.</p>
<p>To address this risk, a marine cargo survey is performed for each food aid shipment during unloading at the foreign destination. The products subject to marine cargo discharge/delivery survey service include dry staple foods such as rice, peas, beans, and lentils; dry blended foods such as wheat-soy blend and corn-soy blend; and vegetable oil type products. This food aid is typically packaged in polypropylene or paper bags ranging in size from 25 to 50 kilograms, cardboard cartons containing consumer-pack quantities, liquid 20 liter pails, 6/4 liter containers, and 208 liter drums. Bulk grain and oil cargoes may be shipped such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal and vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Agricultural commodities for food assistance programs are shipped overseas using three shipment methods: containerized shipments, breakbulk shipments, and bulk shipments. Cargoes will be shipped port-to-port or on through bills of lading where the cargoes are transported to inland locations.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Evaluation Process:

Offers will be evaluated by performing a comparative evaluation in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3) to determine which response represents the  best  as a whole. 

Quotes will be evaluated by performing a direct comparison of one offer with another in a uniform manner to determine which quote provides the government with its needs, as identified in the RFQ.  The government reserves the right to consider a response that offers more than the minimum and select that response if it provides a benefit to the government. The government has the discretion to accept other than the lowest priced offeror that provides additional benefits. The government also has the discretion to make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations/offers having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best benefit to the government. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Pricing:  The sum of all the CLINs, to include options, will represent the total evaluated price.  Proposed price must be determined to be fair and reasonable to be eligible for award.

Fair and Reasonable Determination
A fair and reasonable price determination will be made through any combination of the following methods:
Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. 
Comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for like items. 
Use of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry. 
Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements. 
Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. 
Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items. 
Analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. 
Because below-cost prices are not inherently improper, when vendors are competing for award of a fixed-price contract, vendors are given notice that a business decision to submit a low-priced quotation may be considered as reflecting on their understanding of the contract requirements or the risk associated with their approach.
Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing.  Unbalanced pricing exits when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items for the base and or option years is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

Failure by the contractor to meet these qualifications or provide evidence of them in their submitted quotation will result in immediate disqualification from award.  These factors are non-negotiable and must be addressed in their entirety.
Award shall be made to the contractor whose quotation offers the lowest priced technically acceptable to the government, considering technical capability, past performance, and price. The government shall evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 
Factor 1   Technical Capability: Provide a maximum of a 5-page capability statement demonstrating technical Capability to meet all of the requirements of the scope of work. This includes the qualifications and certifications of the technologists. 

Factor 2   Past Performance: The Government shall evaluate the offeror s past performance. By past performance, the Government means the offeror s reputation for conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship, i.e., reliable service, qualifications, adherence to contract schedules to include both technical and administrative aspects of performance. The Government shall evaluate past performance on the basis of information that may be obtained from the Offeror or from any other source such as previous commercial or Government contracts. The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.

Factor 3   Price: Vendor s price must be fair and reasonable as determined by Contracting Officer s price analysis. Vendor must provide a cost breakdown for services to be performed and a labor mix for personnel in order for the contracting officer to properly evaluate price reasonableness.
Except when it is determined in accordance to FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government s best interest, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  This includes options under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation.  Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options
Failure to provide the information requested in the evaluation criteria may result in being found non-responsive. 
 (a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(x) The provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. * All firms or individuals submitting a quote shall include a completed copy of this provision, OR have current Representations and Certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM - https://www.sam.gov).

L. 114-328).&nbsp; Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services, based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject-matter expert peers within the Air Force.&nbsp; Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items.<br /><br /><em>***This offering is open to all NAICS***</em></p>
<p>The Air Force intends to obtain "innovative" solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfill requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements.&nbsp; Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are currently not used by units at USAFE-AFARICA that would enhance or streamline mission capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Innovative" is defined as any technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It also includes any new application of an existing technology, process, or method.</p>
<p>This CSO contains broadly defined Areas of Interest (AOI) and attention to more specific requirements. While these AOI's are geared toward meeting USAFE-AFARICA requirements, the Air Force reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements outside of USAFE-AFARICA with similar AOI and mission requirements.</p>
<p>USAFE-AFAFRICA will utilize an open, two-step CSO evaluation process.&nbsp; In step 1, offerors must submit a white paper (technical data) and a pitch deck (PowerPoint Presentation) for evaluation.&nbsp; There is no limit on the number of offers submitted per offeror, neither per AOI nor in total. Once the evaluations are complete, all offerors will be notified as to whether they will be invited to pitch their proposal at a Pitch Day event (step 2).&nbsp; USAFE-AFAFRICA also reserves the right to skip step 2 and make an award after step 1.</p>
<p>Offerors that are selected will receive an invitation to make a virtual pitch to the USAFE/AFAFRICA team during a Pitch Day event, which will be held on 13 November 2019. Please note that travel is not required to participate in the Pitch Day, as the proposals will be presented virtually. Offerors will pitch their solution to evaluators and will be immediately notified if they were selected for an award.</p>
<p>In order to expedite funds, the Government intends to pay a percentage of any awarded contracts with the Government Purchase Card (GPC); this will require you to have the ability to accept a credit card payment at this event for payment.</p>
<p>Further information on Pitch Day will be made available as the event date gets closer. Any questions or concerns can be addressed via e-mail to Mr. Sean Kennedy at <a href="mailto:sean.kennedy@us.af.mil">sean.kennedy@us.af.mil</a>, Mr. Nathaniel Searing at <a href="mailto:nathaniel.searing@us.af.mil">nathaniel.searing@us.af.mil</a>, Mr. John Masters at <a href="mailto:johnathon.masters.1@us.af.mil">johnathon.masters.1@us.af.mil</a> and Maj Jeff Fry at <a href="mailto:jeffrey.fry@us.af.mil">jeffrey.fry@us.af.mil</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals<br /></strong>The following section outlines the proposal requirements.&nbsp; It also includes timelines for submissions and information about the Pitch Day.</p>
<p>All contracts will be firm-fixed price.&nbsp; All supplies or services procured via this CSO are treated as commercial items.&nbsp; The Air Force must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award.&nbsp; The Air Force intends to award FAR Part 12 contracts as a result of this CSO, but reserves the right to award agreements, if deemed in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<p><strong>Questions<br /></strong>All questions related to this CSO and specific AOI's must be submitted in writing via email before&nbsp;10:00 am Eastern Time, 30 September 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal Submission<br /></strong>In order for your proposal to be evaluated for a possible invitation to the Pitch Day event 13 Nov 2019, it must be submitted via email to Mr. Sean Kennedy at <a href="mailto:sean.kennedy@us.af.mil">sean.kennedy@us.af.mil</a>, Mr. Nathaniel Searing at <a href="mailto:nathaniel.searing@us.af.mil">nathaniel.searing@us.af.mil</a>, Mr. John Masters at <a href="mailto:johnathon.masters.1@us.af.mil">johnathon.masters.1@us.af.mil</a> and Maj Jeff Fry at <a href="mailto:jeffrey.fry@us.af.mil">jeffrey.fry@us.af.mil</a> on or before 10:00 am Eastern Time, 7 October 2019.&nbsp; A hardcopy will not be accepted. If your proposal is received after the due date, it will not be accepted.</p>
<p>USAFE-AFAFRICA recommends that you complete your submission early, as computer traffic gets heavy near the announcement closing and could slow down the system.&nbsp; Do not wait until the last minute. USAFE-AFAFRICA will not be responsible for proposals received late due to servers being "down" or inaccessible.</p>
<p>Offerors may submit proposal amendments any time prior to the proposal deadline (7 October 2019) specified on the FBO website, however the Air Force will ONLY review the final amended proposal that is submitted.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your e-mail address listed in your proposal is current and accurate.&nbsp; USAFE-AFAFRICA is not responsible for ensuring notifications are received by firms changing mailing address/e-mail address/company points of contact after proposal submission without proper notification to USAFE-AFAFRICA.&nbsp; Changes of this nature shall be annotated in the FBO submittal or amendments.</p>
<p>A proposal is acceptable if it conforms to all material requirements of the CSO, otherwise it is unacceptable and may be ineligible for award.</p>
<p><strong><em>**Note: Offerors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to this solicitation are reviewed carefully prior to submitting a proposal.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pitch Day<br /></strong>Offerors that are selected for step 2 will receive an invitation to make a pitch to the USAFE-AFAFRICA team of evaluators during a Pitch Day event to be held 13 November 2019.&nbsp; Invited offerors proposing service-based solutions will be required to provide a Performance Work Statement (PWS) by 15 October 2019.&nbsp; A PWS is similar to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) used in the commercial marketplace.&nbsp; The PWS shall detail the proposed work to be completed during the period of performance.</p>
<p>Offerors selected for Pitch Day will have an opportunity to pitch their solution(s) submitted during step 1 to evaluators.&nbsp; To the greatest extent practicable, offerors will be immediately notified if they were selected for an award during Pitch Day on 13 November 2019.&nbsp; USAFE-AFAFRICA reserves the right to award to offerors who do not attend the Pitch Day event, but most awards will be made in person at the event.</p>
<p>In order to expedite funds, selectees must be able to accept an initial payment under the contract through a Government Purchase Card (GPC) as part of the conditions of award.</p>
<p>Further information on Pitch Day will be made available as the event date gets closer.</p>
<p><strong>Procedures and Criteria for Selecting Proposals<br /></strong>USAFE-AFAFRICA will utilize a two-step evaluation process.&nbsp; In step 1, offerors submit a cover letter, white paper and a pitch deck.&nbsp; In step 2, offerors will make a live pitch to the USAFE-AFAFRICA Team.</p>
<p>After receipt of step 1 proposals, the Air Force will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.</p>
<ul>
<li>The technical factor will assess how innovative the solution is (as defined in this announcement) and the feasibility of the solution solving the unit's challenges. </li>
<li>The importance to agency programs factor will assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit. </li>
</ul>
<p>The funds availability factor will assess the availability of funding to purchase the solution at Pitch Day.</p>
<p>Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable.&nbsp; The Air Force must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209.&nbsp; The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable.&nbsp; In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request information from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the Air Force and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, the Air Force will select offerors to participate in step 2, a Pitch Day.&nbsp; All offerors will be notified as to whether they will be invited to pitch their proposal at a Pitch Day event.</p>
<p>Offerors that are selected for step 2 will receive an invitation to make a live pitch to the USAFE-AFAFRICA team during a Pitch Day event to be held 13 November 2019 at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Offerors will pitch their solution to evaluators and to the greatest extent practicable will be immediately notified if they were selected for an award.&nbsp; The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1: technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.</p>
<p>During any step of the CSO, the Air Force may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation.&nbsp; The Air Force reserves the right to award to an offeror prior to step 2, Pitch Day event.</p>
<p>The Government may elect to use external market research in the evaluation of the proposal.</p>

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance. This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability. Quoter/Offeror certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Attached is the answers to the questions asked by industry.<br /><br />Vendor Question:
<p>The equipment breakdown starting on page 12 shows specific POPs for each type of equipment. Then on the line item price chart on starting on page 17 there is a completely different list of POPs. Can you please advise which way you would like the equipment quoted?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Please refer to the dates listed in the "Equipment" section starting on page 12. These dates will supersede over those listed in the Bid Schedule on page 17 if there is a discrepancy between the two. Please note that all dates are estimated.</p>
<p><br />Vendor Question:</p>
<p>Would you please let us know how many hours a week the rental equipment will be used? Knowing this will give us a better idea of how to quote this project.</p>
<p>Single shift 8 hrs/day 40hrs/week<br />Double shift 9-16 hrs/day 80hrs/week<br />Unlimited use unlimited</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>It is expected that all items will be used 40 hours or less per week.</p>
<p><br />Vendor Question:</p>
<p>It appears this contract is written up as an "all or nothing" award. Will not bidding on any of the line items (001 thru 043) prevent a contractor's bid from being qualified for award?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Yes. Interested contractors should provide a bid for each line item 001 thru 043 in order to be qualified for award of the contract.</p>

<p>RFI: FA805219RFI01</p>
<p><br />1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The 773d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS), in support of the Office of the Air Force Surgeon General, is conducting a market survey to determine commercial and industry capabilities and practices, to identify qualified sources, and to solicit comments on the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). This Request for Information (RFI) is in reference to Third Party Collections and Billing in support of 75 Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) at both stateside and overseas locations (attachment 1, PWS).</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any service whatsoever. Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offeror to monitor FedBizOpps for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 The Air Force Medical Service is seeking contract support for various medical billing and collection activities in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>2.2 A description of the anticipated effort is outlined in the attached PWS. Please be advised this is a draft PWS and is subject to change based on the information received from this RFI.</p>
<p>2.3 Delivery Period: One (1) Base Year contract plus four (4) Option Years beginning in or around September 2020.</p>
<p>2.4 Security Requirements: As defined in the PWS.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>3.1 Performance Metrics: Briefly describe industry and commercial standards your organization currently employs to measure performance? How would you apply or adapt these metrics to measure performance for services described in the PWS? Are there additional or new quality indicators within the healthcare industry that would strengthen the PWS?</p>
<p>3.2 Business Model: Provide a general overview of how your business structure would accommodate billing for up to 75 MTF's located throughout the United States and Overseas. For planning purposes, estimations should be based on at least 1.5 million outpatient and 2,000 inpatient claims per year. In your business model description, include the specific resource allocation you propose, i.e. locate billing personnel at each MTF, establish a vendor hosted, centralized billing hub, employ a hybrid/combination of the two methods, or other. Provide the rational for your approach. Responses should include the ability to remotely access Department of Defense systems as well as the possibility remote access will not be available. Responses to this RFI should also include your organizations current and planned methodologies for other health insurance (OHI) discovery? Describe previous experience your organization may have with regard to the transition into a contract similar to this acquisition. Please also provide a rough order magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the proposed contract.</p>
<p>3.3 Risk Areas: What tasks and/or managerial aspects applicable to this acquisition would you characterize as high-risk areas? What mitigation techniques would you recommend be employed to those respective risks?</p>
<p>3.4 Contract Type: To ensure timely and complete follow-up collection activities occur under the proposed contract, briefly describe reimbursement methodologies you recommend to incentivize performance? What industry practices are currently used to maximize collections and reduce collection time? Previous methods employed by the AFMS focused on reimbursements based on a percentage of payments collected for billed claims.

<DESC>***Update***<br />&nbsp; 4 October 2019- A full Draft RFP will not be issued for this acquisition; instead, the Government will release sections of the RFP incrementally, until the final RFP is released in January 2020. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Draft Section C. Scope of Work for RFP W56HZV-19-R-0101 has been uploaded for industry review and comment. Please use the Microsoft Excel "Stryker MCWS Comment Matrix" to submit questions and/or comments by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on 25 October 2019 to <a>jenna.n.mcginnis.civ@mail.mil</a> and <a>antonio.c.smith13.civ@mail.mil</a>.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span><br />The purpose of this RFI is for the United States Government (USG) to determine the industry capabilities to produce and integrate a MCWS using a XM813 (30x173mm cannon) onto a Stryker DVHA1. PMO SBCT produced a MCWS on a Flat Bottom Hull, as a replacement to the Remote Weapon Station (RWS) currently on the platform in support of an Operational Needs Statement (ONS). The USG is considering the pursuit of a potential future system to be integrated fleet wide on the DVHA1 chassis. General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) is currently the prime manufacturer of the Stryker DVHA1 and a complete systems-level Technical Data Package (TDP) is not available.
<p>Any information received in response to this survey will be used by the USG to aid its current Stryker Acquisition Planning effort and a potential competitive Request for Proposal (RFP). Currently, the USG plans to obtain the prospective requirements identified within this survey from a source that has the ability or capability to meet the USG's requirements.<br /><br />***Update*** The Chief of Staff of the Army made the decision to go forward with 30mm Program of Record for Stryker. Additional information will be forthcoming in the Phase 1 Request for Quote, W56HZV-19-Q-0082.</p>

It is expected to be needing these services beginning the late October  November 2019 timeframe with anticipated completion of all five (5) sites is late spring or early summer 2020.

1.	A single engine aircraft would be acceptable as long as it is able to transport the projected weight loads.

3.	The Government prefers that all hook-up, rigging, straps, cargo net, etc., be provided by the contractor.
4.	Passenger pick-up and drop-off locations will vary depending on the site we are working at the time beings the 5 sites are not all in the same area.
5.	Maximum payloads are still in planning but dont expected to be as much as $5,000lbs.
6.	Any costs associated with this effort are to be captured in the daily rate proposed for the estimated number of days such as mobilization and demobilization.  Final payment will be based on the actual number of flight days the project takes by aircraft type and each day the aircraft is held on standby.

<DESC><p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is issuing this solicitation for the Consolidated Program Support Services (CPSS) Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)&nbsp;acquisition activity. The CPSS acquisition includes three separate Source Evaluation Boards (SEBs) for the following disciplines:</p>
<p>Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)<br />Project Coordination (PC)<br />Configuration and Data Management (CDM)</p>
<p>This posting includes the&nbsp;Final Request for Proposal (RFP) for CPSS PP&amp;C. &nbsp;All questions regarding the solicitation shall be submitted via email to the individual noted in the provision MSFC 52.205-90, <em>Designated Point of Contact</em>.</p>
<p>This solicitation is for the CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition which is the follow-on competition for the existing Marshall Integrated Program Support Services (MIPSS) PP&amp;C task order and MIPSS Programmatic Subject Matter Expert (SME) task order.</p>
<p>CPSS PP&amp;C includes PP&amp;C integration, Earned Value Management (EVM), cost estimating, cost analysis, and scheduling. The PP&amp;C integration discipline includes programmatic services supporting managers and decision makers for all aspects of program performance including planning, budgeting, scheduling, cost control, EVM, full cost accounting and budgeting implementation, workforce tracking and analysis, and risk management. The EVM discipline provides support in the area of EVM processes, analyses, and assessments including the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) process per the NASA IBR Handbook, and surveillance and compliance activities per Electronic Industries Alliance EIA-748, Earned Value Management Systems, as well as training of EVM processes and tools. The Cost Estimating and Cost Analysis discipline provides support to program and projects in determining life-cycle costs (LCCs) and provides independent cost assessments of on-going projects. Within the PP&amp;C cost estimating and analysis discipline, support for resource data storage and retrieval library will be required. The Resource Data Storage and Retrieval (REDSTAR) Library is a physical and online storage location for documents containing cost, schedule, technical, and programmatic data on NASA and non-NASA projects, along with studies, cost estimates, and other documents of interest to the NASA cost estimating community. The scheduling discipline provides support in the areas of WBS and schedule development, maintenance, analysis, assessments to include schedule risk assessments, and training.</p>
<p>CPSS SME discipline provides highly qualified experienced SME support to program management including, but not limited to, mentoring, strategic program and project planning and alternatives analysis, program cost and schedule projections, project review, and special studies as requested by the Government.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition is a total small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C contract will provide Mission Service PP&amp;C support for MSFC and Johnson Space Center (JSC); however, it will include an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) component to provide additional PP&amp;C support service and SME support Service to MSFC and any other NASA Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical &amp; Service Support Centers, as identified in subsequent awarded task orders, and at such other locations as may be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. The CPSS PP&amp;C contract period of performance will include a one-year base period and four one-year option periods (to be exercised at the Government's discretion). The Mission Services and IDIQ portions of the contract&nbsp;are anticipated to be firm-fixed-price and the SME IDIQ effort is anticipated to be Time and Materials (T&amp;M). Performance-based deductions will apply to the contract in its entirety.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall possess an active Top Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) by the due date for receipt of proposals. Unpopulated Joint Venture (JV) offerors must have Top Secret FCLs for each member of the JV by the specified due date. Utilizing the CAGE code(s) provided, the Government will verify that the offeror possesses an active FCL using the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency's (DCSA) National Industrial Security System (NISS). No offeror will be considered for award that does not have a Top Secret level FCL in place by the due date for receipt of proposals.</p>
<p>Previous postings for this requirement include:</p>

<p>3. On August 5, 2019, the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) (Reference Number: 80MSFC19R0010) was posted on FedBizOpps to solicit comments from industry for consideration in developing the final solicitation.</p>
<p>4. On August 13, 2019, the DRFP Industry Overview chart package (Reference Number: 80MSFC19R0010) was posted on FedBizOpps to highlight acquisition requirements and key unique aspects of the solicitation and serve as an aid in preparation of proposals.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit offers using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation and NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1815, Contracting by Negotiation. All responsible sources may submit an offer in response to the solicitation which will be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p>The solicitation and documents related to this procurement will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps.gov) website https://www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors must monitor the FedBizOpps website for updates related to this acquisition.</p>
<p>NASA FAR Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.</p>
<p>Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged. All questions must be submitted in writing by e-mail to Jennifer.A.Jones@nasa.gov.</p>

<DESC><p>PURPOSE: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Detroit District, is issuing an Invitation for Bid (IFB) solicitation to construct the New Soo Lock Upstream Channel Deepening at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Solicitation package is attached to this notice.</strong></p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: USACE Detroit District anticipates awarding one firm-fixed price construction contract as the result of a sealed bid solicitation. No solicitation document exists at this time. The anticipated solicitation release date is around October 2019.</p>
<p>The scope of the project includes deepening of the upstream approach to the locks in the north canal at the Soo Locks complex in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan in order to eventually accommodate the construction of a new Poe sized lock in the place of the existing Sabin Lock. The channel will be deepened to 29 feet below Low Water Datum plus 1 foot of required over-depth and 1 foot of allowable over-depth. The removal of a total of approximately 300k CY comprised of both bedrock (Jacobsville Sandstone) and overburden material will be required. The contractor will have the option to use mechanical means or blasting to remove the bedrock. Monitoring will be required to ensure nearby structures such as the lock walls, highway and railroad bridges are not affected. Material will be taken by the contractor to an upland disposal site directly adjacent to the work area. Access to the deepening site is limited and is mainly accessible by water.</p>
<p>*The description above is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF TIERED EVALUATIONS:  This procurement is set-aside based on an order of priority as established in 38 U.S.C. 8127. TIERED EVALUATIONS INCLUDING LARGE BUSINESS CONCERNS: This solicitation is being issued as a tiered evaluation with the following tiers: (1) SDVOSB concerns, (2) VOSB concerns, (3) small business concerns with HUBZone small business concerns and 8(a) participants having priority; and (4) large business concerns. If award cannot be made, the solicitation will be cancelled, and the requirement resolicited. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to issue Request for Quotes (RFQ) for the acquisition of consumable commodities in support of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program catalog.  The MSPV Program is a partnering effort between Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) and the VA Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction (OALC) to deliver a national strategic sourcing solution that combines a formulary approach with electronic cataloging and ordering of a wide range of medical and surgical supplies for the Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) and related facilities. The establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) is in direct support of this initiative and is a key element in the success of the MSPV Program as the BPAs will provide the mechanism that will supply the estimated 49,000 types of supplies for distribution to all VHA facilities located in the United States (US) and all US Territories.  In order to support the MSPV Program, the VA will establish BPAs for medical/surgical supplies through Open Market BPAs under FAR Parts 12/13. The solicitation will be structured as a tiered evaluation to maximize Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business (SD/VOSB) participation. Quotations will be evaluated based on technical, price, and past performance.  VHA clinicians will participate in evaluating all supplier quotations and awards will be made using comparative analysis.  An Authorized Distributor Letter from the Manufacturer shall be included with all responses.  The Authorized Distributor Letter from the Manufacturer shall include for each product(s) proposed authorizing the Offeror as a distributor for the proposed product(s).  The letter must either state specific product(s) proposed or that the Offeror is an authorized distributor for all of the Manufacturer s products.  This letter must be on the Manufacturer s letterhead and contain the signature of an authorized official for the Manufacturer.  In order for the authorized distributor/supplier to participate in the MSPV Program, the authorized distributor/supplier and the Prime Vendor shall establish a Commercial Agreement within 30 days of this award. The Commercial Agreement will govern the terms and conditions of the authorized distributor/supplier relationship and will not contradict the underlying terms and conditions established by this BPA or the underlying MSPV Contract.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 339113   Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing.  Any future amendments and other miscellaneous documents will be available electronically for download at the following URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available, and no telephone requests for paper copies of the solicitation will be accepted. Interested offerors are advised to continuously check this URL for any changes to this solicitation. All responsible sources may submit an offer that if timely received, will be considered. The points of contact for this procurement are Matt Zawada, Matthew.Zawada@va.gov and Jessica Rasmussen, Jessica.Rasmussen3@va.gov.

(SDVOSB), Maness Veteran Medical, LLC (SDVOSB), SJ Medsav Solutions LLC (SDVOSB), and TEVET LLC (SDVOSB). A search in GSA eLibrary showed that Roche Diagnostics Corporation has GSA contracts V797P-5279B, GS-07F-0446V, and V797P-7347A. After searching through its price list, it was determined that the required supplies are not available on either of Roche s GSA schedules. See section 6 of this document for the results of the sources sought notice.  

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  The manufacturer has provided a sole source letter certifying the proprietary nature of the required products. (see attachment).

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: Roche Diagnostics Corporation.


A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: The VA will continue performing market research through the use of sources sought notices to survey the market and determine the availability of additional suppliers.

<AWARDEE>The Boeing Company, Seattle, WA 98108 US
<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) delivery order for the procurement of supplies and engineering services in support of Navy P-8A Poseidon Flight Test Aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tasking will consist of performing activities required to support Government flight operations on the P-8A flight test aircraft and the Patuxent River Naval Air Station System Integration Lab (PAXSIL).</p>
<p>The effort was procured pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Boeing Company (Boeing) is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the P-8A and its sole integrator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The test aircraft are outfitted with test instrumentation installed by Boeing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the configuration and non-commercial and commercial technical data associated with each aircraft excluding the test instrumentation, the Government does not possess any technical data associated with the test instrumentation nor can the Government acquire the necessary data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>It was determined that a CPFF contract action was the appropriate contract type pursuant to DFARS 235.006(b)(ii) (A). This is a development program for which the use of a fixed-price type contract would not provide an equitable and sensible allocation of program risk between the Government and the Contractor due to the uncertainties related to the Increment 3 requirements.</p>

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) proposes to negotiate a sole source contract with Fiber Materials Inc. (FMI), located at 5 Morin Street, Biddeford, ME 04005 pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This contract is for Thermal Protection System (TPS) products in support of the Mars Sample Return (MSR) Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV) mission:<br />1. Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) infusion/processing and part machining of various flat and curved composite panels, tooling, and fittings. These articles will provide the necessary TPS for the backshell of the MSR EEV.<br />2. Single-piece, 1.3 [TBR] meter diameter PICA forebody heat shields for the forebody of the EEV.<br />3. Infusion and machining of Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) preforms for a tiled forebody heat shield.<br />4. Infusion and machining of single-piece, 1.3 [TBR] meter diameter HEEET heat shields for the forebody of the EEV.<br />FMI has a long history of manufacturing PICA TPS and other lightweight ablator materials and components for NASA and its prime customers, and has experience with HEEET materials. FMI has an unique capacity to fabricate billets and/or near-net-shape single piece articles of carbon FiberForm using a proprietary process and resin infuse FMI supplied carbon FiberForm to yield a NASA certified PICA TPS or to resin infuse NASA supplied 3D carbon weave to yield NASA certified HEEET TPS. <br />FMI is also unique in that it has relevant process specifications, staff and training in place to manufacture PICA and/or HEEET immediately without the need to purchase and/or modify capital equipment or facilities. This in-house capability will allow NASA to meet critical MSR milestones necessary for the MSR EEV project to perform their roles, as directed by NASA Headquarters.
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this requirement in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 5 p.m. PST on October 18, 2019.
