20.  Mandatory Language:
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-1984, James.Headington.1@us.af.mil

name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Item (Oct 2014)
IAW FAR 13.106-1(a) (2) award will be made to the offeror who represents the best value to the Government.  Price will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures at FAR Subpart 13.1. It is anticipated that adequate price competition will exist; thus, the Government intends to evaluate prices by comparison among offerors.  Award will be made to the lowest price offeror that receives Â¿acceptableÂ¿ technical rating and is determined to be responsible.  An Â¿unacceptableÂ¿ rating in any factor or sub-factor will result in the overall technical proposal being rated Â¿unacceptable,Â¿ and the proposal will therefore be ineligible for award.   
Â¿Lowest Price Technically AcceptableÂ¿ Evaluation Standards
Rating	Definition
A (Acceptable)
 All of the minimum acceptable criteria as defined in the technical factors are clearly met by the proposal.  The offerorÂ¿s proposal meets the technical capability requirements defined in the solicitation.
U (Unacceptable) 
Not all of the minimum acceptable criteria are met by the proposal.  An unacceptable proposal contains one or more deficiencies.  Proposal fails to meet specified minimum technical capability requirements defined in the Specifications and the solicitation.
The following evaluation factor(s) will be used to determine acceptability:  
a.	Technical: The offeror shall provide the specifications showing that the product offered meets the minimum specifications.  
b.	Price: Offerors shall submit pricing and complete fill-ins for the CLIN(s) listed on the solicitation sheet including. Identify quantities, unit prices, extended prices, and exact description/make/model of material to be used. Comparison of proposed lump sum prices received in response to this solicitation (competition) is the preferred and intended price analysis technique. Other analysis techniques, if deemed necessary, may be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price, such as comparison of previously proposed prices or analysis of other than cost and pricing data. The Government may reject any price that is evaluated to be unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates or Government realism analysis, such that the price is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity of this requirement. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

<DESC>This requirement is for a long-term Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements type contract based upon Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation criteria. The Government intends to make one (1) award. The LTC will have a three (3) year base period and two (2) one (1) year Option Periods, for a total of five (5) years. This requirement covers a total of seven (7) NIINs for Shipping and Storage Containers, listed in the attachment (Appendix A). The procurements will be for quantities totaling 275,097 Shipping and Storage Containers used for the safe keeping and transportation of Common aircraft components. 

All Shipping and Storage Containers listed in Appendix A have an assigned AMC code of 1C/2C Limited Competition in accordance with N241 Source Approval Request Policy for Reusable Shipping and Storage Container Procurements.
 The AMC of 1C/2C means it is suitable for competitive acquisition for the first or second time and these parts require engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activityâ€™s procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. Each item has been evaluated by NAVSUP WSS Packaging Engineers Code N241 and has at least two (2) approved sources of supply. If you are unsure if you are an approved source of supply for any item, please contact Kristen Spahr at Kristen.spahr@dla.mil or 215-737-4479 and include the list of NIINs which you are interested in supplying.

All contractors will be required to submit a successful FAT during first resultant order for each NIIN awarded.
 There will be no waivers granted initially whether or not a FAT was previously completed under a prior contract. Once FAT is successfully completed, awardees will not be required to submit additional FAT units for the remainder of the contract for the awarded NIIN.  FAT will be included on the initial delivery order for each NIIN regardless of a prior successful FAT approval for that NIIN. Once a FAT is successfully completed under the Long Term Contract (LTC) it will be waived for the remainder of the LTC for that particular NIIN. 

The Government intends to make one award based upon the proposal which has the total Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offer for all NIINs inclusive of Options.

<DESC>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement intends to solicit and negotiate a 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract solely with Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), 444 Salomon Circle, Sparks, NV 89434-9651 for the sustainment of Tactical Radio Application eXtension (TRAX) and Android TRAX (ATRAX) products. SNC's TRAX and ATRAX products constitute USSOCOM's current solution for an integrated Air/Ground tool that implements coded waveforms to Bi-Direction Translation of Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and IP Cursor on Target (CoT) that have been tailored for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use on the battlefield objective. These products are currently validated as fully interoperable with the Hand Held Link 16 radio and the Digitally Aided Close Air Support Gateway-SOF (DACASG-S) as displayed through multiple joint exercises and OCONUS operations. TRAX also supports specific message translations required by SOF, and is currently certified by the Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC) and approved for use for irregular warfare.
<p>A determination not to compete this proposed contract was made pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one source is capable of satisfying the agency's requirements. This determination is based on the fact that SNC is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole developer of TRAX and ATRAX software. SNC is the only company that can provide the appropriate software upgrades and level of services/support required for the product such as software patching, upgrade, support installation, integration, training, exercise support, as well as planning, engineering, integration, and software support.</p>
<p>Entertaining procurement of a like support capability is untenable for two reasons. First, as the sole developer of TRAX software and owner of full rights to its intellectual property, only SNC can provide the services and support required for the product, such as, software patching, upgrade, support installation, integration, training, exercise support, as well as planning, engineering, integration, and software support during deployment of TRAX in a combat theater. Second, a follow-on support contract from another source would require the wholesale duplication of a solution other than TRAX, which would require unnecessary extensive and expensive new software integration efforts, plus developmental and operational testing. Acquiring a second solution would also increase training costs to make warfighters even minimally proficient on two systems, and the economies of scale inherent in a single solution would also be lost and costs increased. Deployment of a parallel solution would also disrupt combat operations and introduce risks of mission failure. In summary, as the sole developer of TRAX software, only SNC can provide the appropriate software upgrades and level of services and support required for the product such as software patching, upgrade, support installation, integration, training, exercise support, as well as planning, engineering, integration, and software support without mission degradation and significant duplication of costs.</p>
<p>This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for competitive proposals. The intent of this notice is for informational purposes only.

<DESC><div>Sources Sought Research Requirements</div>
<div></div>
<div>Selective Laser Melting (SLM) R&amp;D system for additively manufactured metals material research</div>
<div><br />The 3D metal printer required is meant to produce three dimensional metal specimens using a laser based system that melts a laser powder. This acquisition will support AFIT related research across the campus through the production of metal specimens for material science research. Additionally, this product will be used to support Additive Manufacturing research efforts directly.</div>
<div><br />This SLM system is meant to mimic a larger and more capable production system (Concept Laser M2) that was purchased in December 2016 and is currently operational at AFIT.</div>
<div><br />The SLM system sought is meant to provide a platform for the development of process parameters for the larger system while not impeding on daily operation of the larger system.</div>
<div><br />This SLM system shall have a total footprint of no more than 2000mm X 2000mm X 2000mm (LxWxH), including room for open access panels, and build chamber dimensions of not less than 100mm X 100mm X 100mm (LxWxH), but with laser power of no less than 200W and optics to mimic the larger and more capable system. This small system must be compatible with the operational requirements of powder handling and sieving related to reactive metals.</div>
<div><br />AFIT already has environmental and hazardous waste handling protocols that currently use Concept Laser specific secondary equipment (2x powder sieves).</div>
<div><br />There is a requirement to match laser scan path protocols between the new and smaller SLM system with the Concept Laser M2 SLM 3D System. The SLM process is very sensitive to the control of the laser and as this smaller SLM system is meant to serve as an R&amp;D test bed for the larger Concept Laser M2 it is required that each machine share the same software to develop and implement laser scan strategies for each machine.</div>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to perform required cleaning of Aircraft Industrial Plant equipment/ facilities, as part of the equipment's regular preventive maintenance.

<DESC>The 836th Cyberspace Operations Squadron (COS) at JBSA Lackland, TX has a requirement to support Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) mission for the Air Force (AF) and combatant command warfighting operators.
<p>BACKGROUND: The cyber threat emulation (CTE) squad generates the effects necessary to evaluate a mission's cyberspace security posture with a focus on non-permissive network access through the realistic replication of representative threats to mission owner's cyber key terrain. CTE capabilities work to primarily enable three direct actions: 1) the education and improvement of cyber defenders understanding of cyber threat tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), 2) replication of representative threats to support risk mitigation efforts, and 3) guide cyber defense operations based on Red Cell perspective.<br />The primary purpose of integrated CTE operations in the CPT is to cover the gap between what current defenders know of cyberspace defense to what defenders need to know about the art of attack and the ITPs of advanced cyberspace attack maneuver. The CTE squad develops representative threat packages and conducts initial targeting of a specified DOD mission and its cyber terrain from a threat perspective. CTE capabilities conduct threat emulation ranging from probing, exploitation, and data exfiltration through approved and coordinated disruption, degradation, or denial effects in order to evaluate and stress cyberspace operations and mission survivability. While not equivalent to DOD Red Teams, CTEs will be certified and accredited in accordance with DOD Red Team policies due to the effects and impact they can have to DOD cyberspace. Working directly with the other CPT squads on the team, with emphasis on Mission Protection and Discovery &amp; Counter Infiltration (DCI), the CTE squad executes participative threat emulation to evaluate established risk mitigation capabilities. CTE squads recommend risk mitigation strategies to hinder threat. CTE squads also execute unannounced and non- cooperative threat emulation to allow for mission risk mitigation capability and TTP validation. Through the conduct of defensive operations the CTE squad provides Red Cell assessment guidance to the conduct of defensive cyber operations. The CTE squad monitors and coordinates threat effects with all other DOD CTE squads and DOD defensive cyber operations. CTE intelligence operators support the awareness and communication of threat capabilities to allow the CTE to maintain and generate realistic representative threat. CTE intelligence operators support the development and integration of intelligence requirements to sustain the mission owner's tasks and integrated cyber defenders. CTEs can be enabled to execute OPFOR objectives during exercise events for which their CPT is not a part of those exercises.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS: This contract will provide essential expertise and capabilities to support the 26 NOG and 26 OSS in DCO/DGO/DCA/OCO missions for the AF and combatant command warfighting operators. The support required is in the following functional areas:</p>
<p>Cyber Threat Emulation Training<br />A classroom training environment shall be utilized with access to private network infrastructure to conduct lecture and simulation exercises for the purpose of CTE concepts. The goal of the class is to give cyber operators, cyber architects, cyber managers the ability to conduct tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to emulate a real-world threat. At the conclusion of the training members should be able to have a deeper understanding of how an organization would perform against an actual threat, and identify where security strengths and weaknesses exist to give a security defense posture. The security defense posture includes people, processes, and technology.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Equipment:</p>
<p>Students shall bring or have government issued laptops in class for the purpose of conducting CTE training. The laptops shall have the following minimum specifications: <br />&bull; x86-compatible or x64-compatible 2.0 GHz CPU minimum or higher<br />&bull; 8 GB RAM minimum with 16 GB or higher recommended Ethernet adapter (a wired connection is required in class; if your laptop supports only wireless, please make sure to bring a USB Ethernet adapter with you)<br />&bull; 40 GB available hard-drive space<br />&bull; An available USB Port<br />VMware shall be installed on each machine to run a Linux guest operating system. Each laptop shall have VMware Player 6 or later or the commercial VMware Workstation 10 or later installed.</p>
<p>The training instructor shall provide all additional software to include virtual machines and hardware to include laptops, servers, routers, switches necessary to conduct CTE simulation in class. All training material shall be configured prior to arriving on site and any troubleshooting shall be the contractor's responsibility.<br />The training course should last no more than six continuous days.

<p>A. The straw in the bales shall be stalks from oats, wheat, rye, barley, rice or from grasses such as Byhalia, Bermuda, etc., furnished in air-dry condition. The bales shall have a standard cross section of 350 mm by 450 mm. All bales shall either be wire-bound or string-tied. The Contractor may use either wooden stakes or steel posts to secure the straw bales to the ground. Wooden stakes utilized for this purpose shall have minimum dimensions of 50 mm by 50 mm and shall have a minimum length of 1m. Steel posts utilized for Straw Bale installation shall have a minimum mass of 1.98 kg per linear meter and a minimum length of 1 m.</p>
<p>B. Contractor shall select and provide protective devices according to applicability for each basin or inlet. Acceptable methods are limited to (unless proposed substitute is submitted to and approved by the Construction Contract Inspector):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />1. Straw Bale Inlet/Basin Protection: Straw Bale barriers (straw meeting standards established in 3.2 above), staked with a minimum of two stakes or rebar driven through each bale. This method of inlet protection is applicable where the inlet drains a relatively flat area (slopes no greater than 5 percent), and where sheet or overland flows occur (flows not exceeding 0.5 Cubic feet/sec (0.014 cu. meter/sec)) are typical. This method should not apply to inlets receiving concentrated flows, such as in street or highway medians.</p>
<p>2. Curb Sediment Barriers: Perforated metal or plastic curb sediment (box) barriers shall be used. Proposed substitutions must be submitted and approved by the Government Construction Contract Inspector. This method of inlet protection is applicable at curb inlets where an overflow capability is necessary to prevent excessive ponding in front of the structure.</p>
<p>PART 3 EXECUTION</p>
<p>3.1 INSTALLATION OF SILT FENCES: Silt fences shall extend a minimum of 400 mm above the ground surface and shall not exceed 860 mm above the ground surface. Filter fabric shall be from a continuous roll cut to the length of the barrier to avoid the use of joints. When joints are unavoidable, filter fabric shall be spliced together at the support post, with a minimum 150 mm overlap, and securely sealed. A trench shall be excavated approximately 100 mm wide by 100 mm deep on the upslope side of the location of the silt fence. The trench shall be backfilled and the soil compacted over the filter fabric. Silt fence shall be removed upon approval by the CO.</p>
<p>3.2 INSTALLATION OF STRAW BALES: Straw bales shall be placed in a single row, lengthwise on the contour with ends of adjacent bales tightly abutting one another. Straw bales shall be installed so that bindings are oriented around the sides rather than along the tops and bottoms of the bales in order to prevent deterioration of the bindings. The barrier shall be entrenched and backfilled. A trench shall be excavated the width of a bale and the length of the proposed barrier to a minimum depth of 100 mm. After the bales are staked and chinked (gaps filled by wedging with straw) the excavated soil shall be back filled against the barrier. Backfill soil shall conform to the ground level on the downhill side and shall be built up to 100 mm against the uphill side of the barrier. Loose straw shall be scatter over the area immediately uphill from a straw bale barrier to increase barrier efficiency. Each bale shall be securely anchored by at least two stakes driven through the bale. The first stake or steel post in each bale shall be driven toward the previously laid bale to force the bales together. Stakes or steel posts shall be driven 450 mm deep into the ground to securely anchor the bales.</p>
<p>2.3 INSTALLATION OF INLET/BASIN PROTECTIVE DEVICES</p>
<p>A. STRAW BALE INLET/BASIN PROTECTION: The bales must be installed such that the lower surface of the bales are at a level of at least 2" lower than the level of the ground to the exterior of the inlet protection device, but no deeper than 4" . The soil surrounding exterior of the device must be compacted to prevent piping.</p>
<p>B. CURB SEDIMENT BARRIERS: The barrier must be placed over the top of the inlet or basin, and sized appropriately to ensure clearance with all (non-curb) sides. DOT No. 1 Coarse Aggregate should be filled against the exterior, to the top of the barrier.</p>
<p>3.4 MAINTENANCE: The Contractor shall maintain the temporary and permanent vegetation, erosion and sediment control measure and other protective measures in good and effective operating condition by performing routine inspections to determine condition and effectiveness, by restoration of destroyed vegetative cover, and by repair of erosion and sediment control measures and other protective measures, The following procedures shall be followed to maintain the protective measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />A. SILT FENCE MAINTENANCE: Silt fences shall be inspected in accordance with Paragraph 3.5 - INSPECTIONS. Any required repairs shall be made promptly. Close attention shall be paid to the repair of damage silt fencing resulting from end runs and undercutting. Should the fabric on a silt fence decompose or become ineffective, and the barrier is still necessary, the fabric shall be replaced promptly and the old material disposed of correctly. Sediment deposits shall be removed when deposits reach one-third of the height of the barrier. When a silt fence in no longer required, it shall be removed in accordance with Paragraph 1.3.E -Silt Fences. The immediate area occupied by the fence and any sediment deposits shall be shaped into an acceptable grade. The area disturbed by this shaping shall be seeded in accordance with Paragraph 1.3.A. Stabilization Practices.</p>
<p>B. STRAW BALE MAINTENANCE: Straw bale barriers shall be inspected in accordance with Paragraph 3.5 - INSPECTIONS. Any required repairs shall be made promptly. Close attention shall be paid to the repair of damaged bales, end runs and undercutting beneath bales. Necessary repairs to barriers or replacement of bales shall be accomplished promptly. Sediment deposits shall be removed when deposits reach one half of the height of the barrier. Bale rows used to retain sediment shall be turned uphill at the end of each row. When a straw barrier is not longer required, it shall be remove in accordance with Paragraph 1.3.F - Straw Bales. The immediate area occupied by the bales and hay sediment deposits shall be shaped into an acceptable grade. The area disturbed by this shaping shall be seeded in accordance with Paragraph 1.3.A-Stabilization Practices.</p>
<p>C. INLET/BASIN PROTECTIVE DEVICE MAINTENANCE: Maintenance of Straw Bale devices shall be maintained in accordance with Paragraph 3.4.B-Straw Bale maintenance. For box filters, if the stone filter becomes clogged with sediment so that it no longer adequately performs its function, the stone must be pulled away from the barrier, cleaned and replaced.</p>
<p>D. DIVERSION DIKE MAINTENANCE: Diversion dikes shall be inspected in accordance with Paragraph 3.5-INSPECTIONS. Close attention shall be paid to the repair of damaged diversion dikes and necessary repairs shall be accomplished promptly. When diversion dikes are no longer required, they shall be shaped to an acceptable grade. The areas disturbed by the shaping shall be seeded in accordance with Paragraph 1.3.A-Stabilization Practices.</p>
<p>3.5 INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>A. GENERAL: The Contractor shall inspect disturbed area of the construction site, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation that have not been finally stabilized, stabilization proactive, structural practices, other controls and areas where vehicles exit the site at least once every seven (7) calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of any storm that produces 13 mm or more rainfall at the site. Where sites have been finally stabilized, such inspection shall be conducted at least once every month.</p>

<SUBJECT>Parachutist Oxygen Delivery System (PODS)
<SOLNBR>W911QY-18-PODS
<RESPDATE>122917
<CONTACT>Matthew Buchanan, Phone 5082336141, Email matthew.r.buchanan6.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Parachutist Oxygen Delivery System (PODS)
<p>Improved Ram Air Canopy systems, in particular when used in High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) parachute insertion operations, have extended the Military Free Fall (MFF) parachutist's time under canopy. Future Ram Air parachute systems are expected to have descent rates of approximately 9 feet/sec from an objective altitude of 35,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL), exceeding 60 minutes from the parachutist's exit from the aircraft to the ground. These extended high altitude and stand-off missions require a significant increase to the parachutist's supply of oxygen (O2), which is now supplied by a dilution-demand technology.</p>
<p>The Army's current oxygen system is comprised of the Parachutist Oxygen Masks (POMs), individual parachutist Oxygen Bailout Bottles, on-board Oxygen Consoles, and Oxygen Transfer Pumps used to fill the Bailout and Console bottles. Oxygen consumption studies have confirmed that the current O2 Bailout Bottles cannot not provide the parachutist with sufficient oxygen to support these extended operations, thus decreasing mission capability and decreasing parachutists' ability to complete their mission.</p>
<p>Current Oxygen Consoles are designed to support the pre-breathe requirements of up to 6 parachutists, but in many cases the volume is inadequate and necessitates additional consoles and/or large "K" bottles being loaded on the aircraft.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PdM SCIE), Personnel Airdrop Team, Natick, MA, is conducting a market survey and requesting technical information from manufacturers/suppliers regarding:</p>
<p>a. Parachutist Oxygen Delivery System (PODS) to provide the Parachutist with O2 during all phases of Military Free Fall (MFF) high altitude /standoff operations, and/or<br />b. Individual O2 system components to provide O2 to the Parachutist during pre-breathe and/or descent portions of high altitude stand-off missions. (Supplemental and pre-breathe oxygen requirements are given in Table 4-1 of the Special Forces Military Free Fall Operations Manual, FM 3-05.211, April 2005).</p>
<p>PdM SCIE is seeking information both on currently available systems/components and systems/components that utilize new and emerging technologies, along with supporting information (calculations, test reports, photos, etc.) indicating level of technical maturity.</p>
<p>Proposed systems/components should address the following:</p>
<p>a. A means to provide the individual Parachutist with sufficient supply of O2 during a descent of 45 minutes threshold/60 minutes objective to 10,000 feet MSL, or ideally, to landing. Size and weight of any O2 equipment carried or worn by the individual Parachutist should be minimized. Should be capable of withstanding opening shocks of up to 15Gs. Should provide a method to verify functionality during pre-jump inspections. Pressurized oxygen containers, if applicable, should be shatterproof. Should operate at temperatures ranging from -65 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 160 degrees F and humidity ranging from zero to 100 %, non-condensing. Dust, sand, frost or ice accumulation should not preclude proper operation of the system.</p>
<p>b. A means to provide the parachutist, at or below 10,000 feet MSL pressure, with sufficient 100% aviation-grade O2 to meet pre-breathe requirements MSL when scheduled to exit the aircraft at or above 20,000 feet MSL to 35,000 feet MSL. <br />c. Any test equipment required to monitor equipment performance.<br />d. Any charging equipment required to transfer oxygen under required pressures.</p>
<p>Desirable attributes:</p>
<p>&bull; Individual components should be physically and functionally compatible with legacy equipment to include tandem systems (tandem master and passenger) and tethered bundle systems.<br />&bull; Should not interfere with equipment mountings, combat loads, or paratrooper worn equipment such as navigation systems, night vision devices, or heads up displays. <br />&bull; Should incorporate a communication capability consistent with current communications systems.<br />&bull; Any equipment worn by the Parachutist should be one size fits all.<br />&bull; The aircraft should be "clean" upon Parachutist exit to avoid leaving O2 equipment on-board to be recovered after the operation is complete or to compromise the inserting unit's mission.<br />&bull; System should support both pre-breathe and descent phases in one system, with a total duration of greater than 3 hours.<br />&bull; Equipment should be capable of modification to incorporate new technologies.</p>
<p>Interested sources shall, within thirty (30) days following the publication of this RFI, respond with information on their current capability. Interested sources shall include detailed information regarding their firm's experience, personnel, facilities and domestic production capabilities, and relevant company background/experience.

<DESC><strong>TITLE:</strong> Instrumented Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-I-MILES) Relevancy <br /><br /><strong>CONTRACT VEHICLE:</strong> Four Sole Source Single Award IDIQ contracts<br /><br /><strong>CLOSING DATE:</strong> 19 December 2017<br /><br />This market research is being conducted to verify that no other sources can meet the specific requirements for each of the proprietary I-I-MILES systems provided in the program description below.<br /><br /><strong>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:<br /></strong><br />The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager Live Training Systems (PM LTS) has a long term need to maintain and evolve the I-I-MILES Legacy Systems through Fiscal Year 2038 when I-I-MILES replacement systems referred to as Army Tactical Engagement Simulation System (ATESS) Increment #3 fielding begins. The I-I-MILES Relevancy program will be broken into several phases. Phase I of the I-I-I-MILES Relevancy program will consist of four sole source single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). This will extend the useful life of the I-I-MILES Legacy Systems and continue to provide a realistic training capability, reduce life cycle costs, and integrate emerging Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or modified COTS technologies. The devices will be upgraded in accordance with the approved Training Device Operational Requirements Document for Replacement of Ground Direct Fire Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES) Devices, CARDS No. 0291, revised July 1996.<br /><br />Fielded I-I-MILES Legacy Systems are Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems (TESS) composed of the Combat Vehicle Tactical Engagement Simulation System (CVTESS), Combat Vehicle Systems (CVS), Individual Weapon System (IWS &amp; IWS2), Tactical Vehicle System (TVS), I-MILES XXI Stryker, Aviation (Long Bow Apache, AH64, CH47, LUH 60 LUH), Home Station Instrumentation System (HITS v3 &amp; v4), Mobile Gun System (MGS),Shoulder Launched Munitions (SLM), Universal Controller Devices (UCD), Micro Controller Devices (MCD), Main Gun Signature Simulator (MGSS), and Direct/Indirect Fire Cue (DIFCUE). <br /><br />I-MILES Relevancy program will also:<br /><br />&bull; Incorporate new and evolving weapon platforms;<br />&bull; Manage, maintain, and evolve I-MILES products, processes and core assets;<br />&bull; Incorporate LT2 Live Personal Area Network (LPAN) and the Live Training Engagement Composition (LTEC) as required;<br />&bull; Support embedded training initiatives;<br />&bull; Life-cycle system managing and Product-Line support of systems/products within the I-MILES Legacy Systems family;<br />&bull; Synchronize with operations and maintenance efforts of PEO STRI PD Field Operations<br /><br /><strong>ACQUISITION APPROACH:<br /><br /></strong>The Government intends to award four sole source single award IDIQs to the OEMs for I-MILES Relevancy.

Equipment Statement of Work (SOW)
Medtronic Situate Detection System X     

Background

The New York Harbor Healthcare System has a need for  brand name or equal  Situate Detection System X (Console X, Body, Room Scanner). The system detects and monitors sponges, using RF, during surgical procedures, this reduces the risk of sponges being left in patients after surgery.    Manual counting has been proven to be only 77% accurate.  Miscounts occur 1 in 64 procedures.   NYHHS is seeking to purchase 10 situate detection systems, 7 for the Manhattan Campus operating rooms and 3 for the Brooklyn Campus operating rooms.  Patients who need surgery require this procurement to maximize patient safety.   Situate Detection System or equal is a technology developed to overcome the difficulty of finding surgical sponges in-vivo and in the surrounding operating room environment.  It employs detection devices to transmit reliable, non-ionizing, low frequency radio waves to detect tagged cotton disposables. When the tagged cotton is stimulated by the device s signal, it transmits its own signal back to the detector, identifying its presence. It s the reliable communication between the detector and the tag that enables the quick and effective resolution of missing sponges.

Specifications/salient characteristics:
Must use RF to detect sponges
Ability to detect sponges from at least 15 inches away in vivo
Must detect sponges in vivo
Must detect sponges in areas of the OR outside of the sterile field
Filters electrical noise found in Operating Rooms
Transmits non-ionizing, low frequency radio waves
This system does not require installation.  Company will provide training before and during first day of use.

In accordance with FAR Part 10, Market Research, this is a sources sought to determine the availability of potential sources/vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to provide all personnel necessary for the provision of tele ICU intensivists physicians to the Department of Veterans Affairs located at the Baltimore VA Medical Center, Tele-ICU Program Office, 10 N Greene Street, Baltimore, Maryland  21201.  All interested contractors are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information. This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources relative to NAICS 621111. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.
General Requirements:
The Tele-Intensive Care Unit (Tele-ICU) Intensivist Physician, in collaboration with the Tele-ICU Medical Director, Tele-ICU Associate Medical Director, Tele-ICU Nurse Manager, and Tele-ICU Program Support have shared responsibilities for the management of the Physician coverage for Tele-ICU sites.  The primary goal is to provide optimal care for patients presenting in intensive care unit (ICU) beds and Emergency Departments (EDs) at remote sites across the continental United States (US) and various US Territories. This requires careful attention to individual medical and surgical problems and efficient management of patient flow, especially during high patient volume periods.  It also requires a high degree of certainty regarding adequate Physician staffing that is planned in advance and for contingencies to be in place. The Tele-ICU Physician will be required to coordinate treatment of ICU patients at remote sites through review of patient information available via ICU cameras, microphones, Clinical Information System (CIS) applications, and the Veterans Affairs (VA) Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). Documentation of competency for Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) Attending Physician treatment is required for the privileging/credentialing processes. 

The mission of the Tele-ICU is to care for critically ill Veterans by providing attentive electronic ICU integration and consistent uninterrupted management utilizing state of the art critical care protocols and interventions in conjunction with the bedside clinical team. Affiliated sites benefit from the Tele-ICU through direct access to Intensivists and Critical Care Nurses. This aids in the care of critically ill patients in ICUs and Emergency Departments (EDs). 

The Tele-ICU has conducted continuous recruitment of intensivists, but is short approximately 1.5 FTE with a potential future need of, up to, 2.0 FTE. This shortage is strained by the demand for services to meet the needs of Veterans, especially those in areas that are rural or medically underserved. The Tele-ICU requires contract Physicians for approximately 5 shifts per week, with each shift being 12 hours in duration (3120 hours annually). The shortage of intensivists has limited physician coverage to less than the desired 24/7/365 intensivist coverage. Average annual contract physician services required is planned for: 5 shifts weekly, 12 hours per shift, for a total of 3,120 hours annually with a potential for up to an additional 1040 hours.

The Cincinnati-based Tele-ICU provides remote critical care support and co-management in multiple states and VISNs across VHA. The program co-manages approximately 300 out of 1,800 VA ICU beds (1 out of 5). Offices are located in Cincinnati (OH), Cleveland (OH),the Greater Los Angeles (CA) area, and Baltimore (MD). Contracted physicians will work in the Baltimore (MD) location, and will oversee patient care at multiple sites nation-wide through virtual technologies.

Currently affiliated Tele-ICU sites include: Charleston, SC; Columbia, SC; Augusta, GA; Dublin, GA; Atlanta, GA; Birmingham, AL; Montgomery, AL; Cincinnati, OH; Dayton, OH; Chillicothe, OH; Cleveland, OH; and Wilkes Barre; PA, for a total of 214 ICU / ED beds. Expansion is in process for Beckley, WV; Clarksburg, WV; Togus, ME, White River Junction, VT; Ft. Wayne, IN; Muskogee, OK; Mountain Home, TN; and Wilmington, DE. The new total ICU / ED beds receiving Tele-ICU support will be 316.

FEMA is principally seeking management companies who do the predominance of their business within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Conversely, all interested entities are encouraged to participate in this survey; regardless of geographical location.</p>
<p>FEMA's Direct Lease Program is a form of Direct Temporary Housing Assistance utilized to lease existing rental units, for the purpose of providing temporary housing to eligible applicants, when the verified disaster-caused housing need cannot be met with other forms of assistance options.

<p>Specifically, FEMA is seeking Property Management companies to act on behalf of the government with property owners or their agents in all aspects of the lease, including but not limited to executing leases, managing tenant concerns, maintenance and executing lease terminations. These property management services will be required to evaluate potential rental units or properties to ensure properties adhere to all local, state and federal codes and standards to be considered habitable by the agency.<br /><br />Temporary housing property types can include: non-multi-family homes, multi-family homes, apartments, cooperatives, condominiums, town houses, or other readily fabricated dwellings.</p>
<p>All properties must be in compliance with the Fair Housing Act and the Housing Quality Standards established by HUD. The property must currently be available to rent and available a minimum of 18 months from the disaster declaration date of September 20th, 2017; with the possibility of extension.</p>
<p>FEMA has a current list of properties supplied by owners who have expressed interest in the Direct Lease program.</p>
<p>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ)</p>
<p>Responses to this notification will be used to determine the availability of sources that can provide these services in the most timely and most cost effective delivery of direct assistance to eligible disaster survivors.</p>
<p>The Government intends to obtain market information or capabilities for planning purposes only. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. All questions and responses must be in writing and received no later than 5:00 PM EST, December 12th, 2017.

TheraSphereÂ® Y glass microspheres are specifically engineered to carry far greater power than any other Y liver-directed cancer therapy, delivering high doses of radiation to liver tumors while sparing normal tissue.  The result is a powerfully-targeted, well-tolerated therapy that may lead to patients becoming eligible for curative therapies.  TheraSphereÂ® is used in transarterial radioembolization (TARE), also known as selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), a procedure in which glass microspheres containing radioactive Y are delivered to the tumor vasculature via transfemoral catheterization of the hepatic artery.  TheraSphereÂ® capitalizes on the uniquely organized dual blood supply to the liver, which occurs through the hepatic artery and the portal vein.  In liver cancer, tumor blood supply is almost exclusively (80 100%) from the hepatic artery.   In contrast, normal liver tissue receives most of its blood flow (75%) from the portal vein.  TheraSphereÂ® glass microspheres are minimally embolic and do not occlude macrovessels. Since vessel patency is maintained, subsequent arterial therapies are possible.  TheraSphereÂ® microspheres penetrate and lodge within the tumor arteriolar capillaries, where they emit lethal beta radiation that is localized to the surrounding tumor tissue.  The targeted distribution of microspheres optimizes dose exposure to the tumor while sparing normal tissue.



The MEDVAMC is defined as the main location at 2002 Holcombe Blvd, Houston Texas, 77030, and all current and future community based outpatient clinics in the Houston Area. The current CBOC Clinics are located in Texas City, Galveston, Richmond, Lufkin, Beaumont, Katy, Tomball Conroe and Lake Jackson all in the state of Texas.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of the NIAID Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) program is to provide a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and other viral pathogens, performed on samples from subjects enrolled in NIAID-sponsored multisite clinical studies. The VQA program ensures the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from NIAID-supported clinical trials and HIV natural history studies by providing laboratories with proficiency testing panels and real-time assay run controls, and analyzing proficiency panel and assay run data from each laboratory. The VQA program also implements standards of performance for existing and state-of-the-art new virologic assays, develops and tests biostatistical methods relating to the assays, and acquires, tests, stores and dispenses quality control materials and reagents. Thus, the VQA program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, assessment of treatments, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures. The VQA has been in operation since 1988 and has developed and standardized quality control procedures for approximately 25 virologic assays used in NIAID-sponsored clinical trials.</p>
<p>The current contract is held by Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, under contract number HHSN272201200023C. The period of performance of the current contract is September 21, 2012 through September 20, 2019.<br />Project Requirements: The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking capability statements from qualified organizations to provide a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and other viral pathogens.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall: 1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays for HIV and HIV related pathogens (including HCV, HBV, CMV, HSV, HPV, and KSHV) to assess the ability of laboratories performing virologic testing for NIAID-sponsored clinical trials (Labs) to successfully perform the assays; 2) conduct studies on the evaluation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistical methodologies for HIV and other viral coinfections; 3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents required for this program, including biohazardous materials and infectious agents; and 4) maintain software systems and electronic document library that support this program; 5) obtain ISO/IEC 17043 certification for Proficiency Testing Providers within one year of the contract and maintain the certification throughout the life of the contract (see http://www.a2la.org); and 6) provide initial and final transition of the contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall serve laboratories associated with current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups. Currently, the contract serves approximately 110 laboratories, with 55 international laboratories in 22 countries.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a potential need to increase the level of effort by exercising Options for the following additional support: 1) to expand the number of laboratories serviced by the Program during the period of the contract; 2) for similar services that address viral disease agents other than HIV and HIV related pathogens; and 3) to add a CLIA certified lab for late stage validation of assays for clinical testing.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, term/level of effort, type contact will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options to extend the term of the contract that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible period of performance of seven (7) years, beginning approximately June 21, 2019. The requirement will be the delivery of 9.80 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year, including consultant and subcontractor effort, for the Base Period (Year 1) and 9.80 FTEs per year, including consultant and subcontractor effort, for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7).</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include:</p>
<p>Options for Increased Level of Effort for Additional Labs: During the period of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support new NIAID supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 5 Labs. These options may be exercised during Years 2 through 7. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 0.20 FTE during the first year, including consultant and subcontractor effort. If the options for these Laboratories are exercised in any year after the first year, 0.10 FTE per year, including consultant and subcontractor effort, will be needed in subsequent years. The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>Options for Increased Level of Effort for Additional Expertise: During the period of the contract it may be necessary to develop a quality assessment program for assays associated with viral disease agents other than HIV and HIV-related pathogens that were not anticipated at the time of contract award, and that would directly support high priority NIAID research programs. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 3.65 FTE, including consultant and subcontractor effort, for each option exercised. One option may be exercised per year in years 2 through 7. The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>Options for Increased Level of Effort for the Addition of CLIA Certified Labs: During the period of the contract, it may become necessary to use new and novel virologic assays in clinical trials where results will be used for clinical decisions within the trial. This will necessitate the use of a CLIA certified laboratory for late stage validation of the assay and for clinical testing. If necessary, this will be provided through the exercise of options to this contract. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 1.0 FTE, including consultant and subcontractor effort, for each option exercised. One option may be exercised per year in years 2 through 7. The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was officially established in fiscal year 2012 to transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. NCATS, one of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) at NIH, strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />This Small Business Sources Sought notice seeks to determine eligible sources capable of achieving the essential features of this potential requirement. The purpose of this potential requirement is to obtain Assorted cell culture medium, substrate and supplements, on the basis of brand name or equal to the Essential 8 stem cell culture system from Life Technologies Corporation.</p>
<p>Ongoing research projects in SCTL focus on understanding molecular mechanisms regulating stem cell pluripotency and their multi-lineage differentiation capabilities with a focus on defining optimum culture conditions for maintaining pluripotent stem cells and their conversion to homogeneous and mature population of differentiated cells. To achieve these aims, SCTL requires a stem cell culture system to meet the lab's specific requirements, including supporting stem cell pluripotency maintenance, multi-lineage differentiation and 3-D culture. Any cell culture media used in this context must meet specific measurements of purity and consistency from batch to batch to provide consistent cell growth and viability. In addition, numerous batches of existing cells have been grown using the Essential 8 stem cell culture system from Life Technologies Corporation for which this potential requirement must be able to achieve through consistent and predictable growth that shall result in continued successful assays performed at NCATS.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK
MASSAGE THERAPIST

Background Information/Purpose 
The Integrative Health & Wellness Program (hereafter  IHW Program ) in Washington, DC offers holistic complementary and integrative medicine interventions to veterans in a comprehensive clinic setting. Currently, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, qigong, integrative nutrition, massage, tai chi, mindfulness and integrative health education courses are offered to Veterans within the facility. The services rendered by the IHW Program have been well-received thus far by not only Veterans, but providers and staff within the Washington, DC VA Medical Center (hereafter  DC VAMC ). It has become evident that massage therapy, one of the most requested services in the IHW Program, is necessary to support expanded integrative health service provision for the benefit of both Veterans and staff.


Information Security 
The massage therapist may be required for storing or maintaining VA sensitive information. According to Veterans Health Administration (hereafter  VHA ) Handbook 6500.6, Appendix C (3) (h),  the contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.   The massage therapist shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. See the related clauses at the end of this document.

All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations,
Security and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. VHA Directive 1605.01, Privacy and Release of Information: All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: (1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the  Contractor Rules of Behavior , which will be provided during the kick-off meeting; (2) Successfully complete the  VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior  training and annually complete required security training; (3) Massage Therapist is aware of and will successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy/HIPAA training and annually complete required privacy/HIPAA training and (4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access.  


The contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer Representative (hereafter  COR ) a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within one (1) week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

Significance of this Project 
As demand continues to grow in the medical center, and as more Veterans request increased access to integrative health offerings, the work that is being done by the IHW Program is a necessity.  The support for IHW service provision will allow a greater number of Veterans and staff in the hospital to take advantage of these positive and supportive wellness activities, and to increase appropriate outreach to other staff and departments throughout the hospital. 

Implementation 
The massage therapist will provide fifteen (15) hours of individual massage therapy appointments at the DC VAMC and will complete up to five (5) hours of administrative work per week at an agreed upon schedule. The massage therapist will require a massage table, desk, and access to a phone and/or computer. The massage therapist will work under the guidance and supervision of the IHW Program Director.

Qualifications
Massage therapist will have graduated from a National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork-Assigned (NCBTMB) School or equivalent (copy/scan of diploma.). Massage therapist will possess an active state license to practice massage therapy and will have at least two years of professional, hands-on experience as a massage therapist.

The scope of this project will include construction of an approximately 172,000 square foot 155-bed space Community Living Center (CLC) designed for the Veterans at this location.  The new CLC will feature thirteen houses as well as a Community Center building to accommodate the CLC program support areas providing care for Dementia, Hospice, Rehabilitation, Short Term and Long Term Care Residents.  The CLC is designed to promote independence and resident choice in a home-like setting.   Fully handicapped accessible houses will allow easy access to secure outdoor living areas in the home s backyard, courtyard or front porch breezeway.  The design of the homes will provide incredible views to the backyard, Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay as the houses are situated along two levels terraced on the site.  The project design was developed around the Planetree Concept creating an environment which is organized first and foremost around the needs of the Veterans.

The original solicitation with specification and drawings were posted November 2016 in www.fbo.gov under VA101-16-R-0086:

A number of modifications to the project have been made, including, but not limited to:

This notice serves a twofold purpose: 1) To issue a Sources Sought notice and 2) To announce Industry Forum for the HINES Information Technology Center facility parking lot upgrades.
The Industry Forum is intended to provide background and general information on HINES Information Technology Center parking lot upgrades and will be used for market research to give the Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) the opportunity to engage contractors to determine overall interest. The Industry Forum is scheduled for December 15, 2017 from 10:00 AM until 12:00 PM at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center, 3001 Green Bay Road, Bldg. 134, Rm. C108, North Chicago, IL  60064.  Parking is limited and attendees are encouraged to carpool.

All responses to the sources sought must be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer, Tiffany Rivers at tiffany.rivers2@va.gov by January 4, 2018, 2:00 pm CST. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). At this time a solicitation does not exist.
CFM is seeking Center for Veteran Enterprises Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) certified and listed in the Vendor Information Pages.  Additionally, the VA is seeking interested businesses that are U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Businesses, SBA certified HUBZone Small Businesses, and/or Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses.
The companies must be listed in the System for Award Management (SAM) with a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 238990 with a small business size standard of $15.0 million.  The small business firm must be capable of self-performing at least 25% of the work.
The term self-perform refers to performing relevant major trade work in-house without subcontractors. This does not include administrative or management functions. Relevant major trade work is that which is the same or similar to the work that may be ordered under the proposed contract.
The information received will be used by CFM to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.
This Sources Sought Synopsis is one facet in the Governments overall market research in regard to whether the proposed solicitation will be issued as a competitive set-aside or as full and open (unrestricted).
The procurement strategy will not be determined based solely on the information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.
No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.

If an SDVOSB set-aside is not appropriate, the requirement will be evaluated to determine whether a Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) set-aside is appropriate. The term SDVOSB / VOSB under the Veterans First Contracting program has the same meaning as defined in FAR subpart 2.101, except for acquisitions authorized by 38 U.S.C. 8127 and 8128 for the Veterans First Contracting Program SDVOSB and VOSB concerns must be listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov  in addition to meeting the NAICS code small business size standard to be eligible for award under Veterans First Contracting Program set-asides.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source, IAW FAR 6.302-1(10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies Will Satisfy Agency Requirements; whereby Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC), Arnold AFB, TN, intends to award a contract to The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), 701 S 20th St., Birmingham AL 35294-0001.
<p>The agency does not intend to issue a solicitation package. However, all interested parties should self-identify and provide proof of their firm's capability to provide the prescribed equipment/product(s) by submitting an accurate description of the equipment/product(s) and process to produce the equipment/product(s) described below. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by AEDC.<br /><br />Interested parties are hereby informed that no award will be made on the basis of responses received. Responses must be electronically sent to Miriam James (miriam.james@us.af.mil). If no favorable responses are received by the date and time indicated in this notice, a contract will be negotiated with the above named source.<br />Interested offerors should refer to the attached Statement of Work for a complete description of the equipment/products(s) required.</p>
<p>Synopsis<br />The overall objective of this work is to provide direct research, design, development, and software test support to the CREATE-AV program in the areas of aircraft aerodynamics, propulsion, structural dynamics, kinematics and kinetics, high enthalpy real gas effects, multi-species effects, pre/post-processing, and case management. This includes the research and development of new code capabilities, maintenance and performance improvements to existing product software, technical user support, and documentation. This work is targeted at the Kestrel product and associated Firebolt module but will undoubtedly involve the other products of the CREATE-AV program due to the interconnections and code re-use between the products.</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.</p>
<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)</p>
<p>Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University of California San Diego (USCD) for the purchase of 400 Certified Reference Material (CRM) bottles for the analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) in Miami, FL.
<p>A sources sought notice was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website on November 17, 2017 and closed on November 27, 2017. No responses were received.</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source<br />The certified reference materials are produced at the UCSD.  These DIC CRMs are the only ones used by the research community worldwide to achieve high precision measurements and inter-comparable results for NOAA's Global Carbon Program.</p>
<p>These CRMs are for scientific research only and not for commercial use and not for sale outside the scientific community.  A major goal of modern oceanography is the coordinated study of oceanic processes on a global scale. The impetus comes from a desire to understand the factors that control climate and how climate changes affect biogeochemical systems.</p>
<p>Twenty thousand bottles of reference materials have now been distributed to a wide variety of laboratories both within the United States and in 19 other countries. They are used extensively to confirm that instruments are performing properly and to ensure measurement compatibility.</p>
<p>These CRM's are used to determine the stability of AOML's instruments and to correct the data after analyses are complete. The harm to the government would be millions of dollars of useless data if the CRM's from the UCSD were not used.  The data that AOML collects would not be comparable or used by the rest of the research community if a different CRM for DIC in seawater did exist and was used by AOML.  Data comparison would be effected by using a different CRM because it would be different from which all others in the research community were using to calibrate their instruments and correct their data with, making our data unusable or questionable at best.  The DIC-CRM's from UCSD are essential and critical to the mission of the government to provide high quality comparable dissolved organic carbon (DIC) data within the government and research communities.  This DIC CRM is special because it has been developed by UCSD over the last couple of decades and collected from the North Pacific Ocean. It has been used by everyone in the global ocean carbon community to calibrate their instruments and to correct their DIC data, which makes everyone's data comparable to everyone else's.</p>

<SUBJECT>58--ID/IQ- PURCHASE & REFURBISH TRANSMITTERS
<SOLNBR>140G0318Q0010
<CONTACT>Lushenko, Nikolas
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, Henderson NV intends to issue a non-competitive award to Holohil Systems, Ltd. of Carp, Ontario, Canada. The IDIQ requirement is to purchase and for the refurbishment of Model# RI-2B and Model# PD-2 transmitters. 

The above company is the only known source that is capable of providing the above mentioned transmitters as the Holohil Systems Ltd Model# RI-2B and Model# PD-2 VHF transmitters have at least five unique features, which are required to meet the Government's minimum needs. 

(1) They're sufficiently small; the USFWS limits the total weight of equipment attached to tortoises to 5 percent of animal body mass. The low weight (less than or equal to 15g for adults, less than or equal to 3.8g for juveniles) is necessary for attaching transmitters to almost any size of desert tortoises. 

(2) United States Fish and Wildlife restricts the frequency and length of time researchers may approach study tortoises; the 24-month battery lifespan reduces frequent stressful handling encounters to replace transmitters. 

(3) The transmitters must have a low profile when attached to a tortoise.  Since desert tortoises live in soil and rock burrows, the VHF transmitters needs to sit low enough on a tortoise's shell to prevent interfering with its movement into and out of burrows. Holohil Systems models RI-2B and PD-2 measures 13mm and 7mm in height, respectively, which matches our required dimensions. 

(4) Holohil Systems programs transmitters to meet regulatory requirements and are specific to the permittee's needs. 

(5) The durability and water resistance of the transmitters are necessary as tortoises often burrow into caliche caves, under rocks, and are subject to predation and climate extremes; all which can damage transmitters.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334220 - Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing, size standards 1,250 employees.

The USGS intends to make a non-competitive award to Holohil Systems, Ltd. The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), FAR 13.5, and FAR 16.5. The anticipated contract will be firm fixed price 5-year IDIQ award. A vendor must be registered at http://www.sam.gov to be awarded the contract. 

Quotation shall only be accepted through electronic mail addressed to nlushenko@usgs.gov. All documents required by this notice must be uploaded and received in their entirety no later than December 8, 2017 at 1700 ET. Quotations submitted by hardcopy or the Fed Connect web portal or Fed Connect Message Center shall not be accepted or considered.

<p>Offerors are cautioned that Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst NJ has visitor control procedures requiring individuals not affiliated with the installation to obtain a visitor pass prior to entrance. SOME DELAY SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED WHEN HANDCARRYING QUOTES. Offerors should allow sufficient time to obtain a visitor pass and arrive at the bid depository PRIOR to the time specified for receipt. LATE QUOTES WILL BE PROCESSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 52.212-1(F) "LATE SUBMISSION, MODIFICATIONS, REVISIONS, AND WITHDRAWALS OF OFFERS."</p>
<p>FEDERAL HOLIDAYS: The following Federal Legal Holidays are observed by this base:<br />New Year's Day 1 January<br />Martin Luther King's Birthday Third Monday in January<br />Presidents Day Third Monday in February<br />Memorial Day Last Monday in May<br />Independence Day 4 July<br />Labor Day First Monday in September<br />Columbus Day Second Monday in October<br />Veterans Day 11 November<br />Thanksgiving Day Fourth Thursday in November<br />Christmas Day 25 December<br />&emsp;<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items <br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value award decision in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis of past performance being more important than price. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>Price Evaluation: The government shall rank all offers by price, including any option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified by the proposed unit price for each contract line item number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each. Offerors whose total evaluated price is unreasonable (in accordance with FAR 15.404 and FAR 31.201-3), unbalanced (in accordance with FAR 15.404-1), or unaffordable (not within any budgetary information included in the solicitation) may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Performance Confidence Assessment: The contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) questionnaires; (2) the past efforts provided by the offeror and (3) data independently obtained from other government i.e. Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS); Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS); Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; and interviews/questionnaires with Program Managers, Contracting Officers and Fee Determining Officials, and commercial sources and commercial sources. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p>a. Recent past performance is identified as relevant past performance performed within the last five years and relevant past performance is defined as successfully maintaining and repairing a variety of air compressors to various locations. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no recent/relevant performance history or if the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably (neutral).</p>
<p>b. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.</p>
<p>c. If the lowest priced offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>d. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Contracting Officer shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>e. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their offer (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for quote revision.</p>
<p>f. Offerors are responsible for submitting a well-written quote with adequately-detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the procuring agency. Those offers who do not provide the detailed information risks an unfavorable rating.<br /><br />LIST OF ATTACHMENTS: <br />&bull;Attachment 1: Pricing Schedule <br />&bull;Attachment 2: Performance Work Statement (PWS) (7 pages) <br />&bull;Attachment 3: Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.212-3 Alt 1 <br />&bull;Attachment 4: Wage Determinations 15-4191 Rev. 3 25 July 17 (Burlington County) and 15-4195 Rev 3 25 June 17 (Ocean County) <br />&bull;Attachment 5: Past Performance Questionnaire<br />&bull;Attachment 6: Security Forces Appendix</p>

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance. This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined.

<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>

<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, December 5, 2017. No specific quote format is required. Please reference solicitation number in email title.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Joel Heisler at (541) 867-8763 or joel.heisler@noaa.gov for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>This commercial item acquisition will be full and open competition with a geographical restriction. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 721110. This acquisition may result in multiple awards.
<p>This is a 100% full and open competition with geographical area restriction for Dubai, and within 11-mile radius from the US Navy compound at Jebel Ali. No hotel/hotel apartment will be considered for an award if the facility is outside of the 11- mile radius restriction mentioned above.</p>
<p>Technical acceptability will be determined on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. In order to receive a technical acceptability rating of "acceptable", the contractor shall provide rooms equivalent of an AAA as 4 Diamond/Star rated facility or higher in accordance with the following:<br />http://www.aaa.biz/Approved/files/evaluation/DiamondRatingGuidelines.pdf.</p>
<p>The lodging accommodations shall be highly maintained, secure, and structurally sound and shall not pose any health, safety, or fire hazard. Furthermore, the contractor's proposed hotel/apartment shall be NCIS/STAAT-assessed within the last three (3) years and have met the minimum requirements of the Statement of Work. If not previously assessed, adequate time must exist to allow for the proper assessment of the facility without impact to the required start of performance date. Should adequate time not exist, the quote will be evaluated as technically unacceptable and the offeror will not be eligible for the award of a purchase order (or contract) under this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government will review the NCIS/ STAAT assessment report and consider any force protection issues identified in the assessment to determine whether the property has acceptable force protection measures. Additionally, the Government reserves the right to inspect the rooms being offered to determine acceptability prior to award.</p>
<p>Further, the offeror must manifest its assent, without exception or imposition of conditions, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including any attachments or clauses or terms incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>In accordance with the CENTCOM Force Protection requirements, occupancy rates of US Forces personnel at local hotels/apartments shall not exceed 25% of the total units of the apartment/hotel or facility. Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts resulting from this solicitation to the lowest-priced technically acceptable contractors on per unit price/per room basis. The award process will be as follows:</p>
<p>The lowest priced technically acceptable offeror will be awarded the quantity up to their respective 25% maximum occupancy rate. Once the first lowest priced technically acceptable offeror has reached their 25% maximum occupancy rate, the Government will award the remaining quantity (if any) to the next lowest priced offeror until their 25% maximum occupancy rate is met. The Government will continue to award the remaining quantity to the next lowest priced offeror until all requirements have been awarded.</p>
<p>The Government has a minimum occupancy per location of fifteen (15) personnel.</p>
<p>System for Award Management - By submission of a bid, the bidder acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the bidder does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered bidder. Bidders may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM database accessed through https://www.sam.gov.<br />Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.202 (a) (12), this is a non-mandatory synopsis. This solicitation is intended only for sources duly authorized to operate and do business in the United Arab Emirates as prescribed by DFARS 225.1103 (3).<br />Services are for Temporary Lodging as detailed in the Statement of Work incorporated in solicitation N4033918QD015.<br />All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted by 04 December 2017, 10:00 AM UAE local time. Questions will be answered via an amendment posted on FedBizOps. Questions are to be submitted to Shiela Cruz-Castro (Mashiel.Cruz.PH@me.navy.mil ).</p>
<p>This RFQ documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Circular: FAC 2005-87.</p>
<p>Acceptance of an award certifies that the firm will comply with FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons, by notifying all employees and subcontractors at all levels.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration issues this solicitation as a brand name acquisition. To the best of the Government's knowledge, only maintenance on Intercede MYID software can fulfill its need.

SSA anticipates procuring these software licenses under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(i), for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, " Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization.) Written responses to this solicitation shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. The Government maintains discretion to purchase only maintenance on Intercede MYID software. Information received is solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>

<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The<br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

<p>(1) For covered contractor information systems that are part of an information technology (IT) service or system operated on behalf of the Government, the following security requirements apply:</p>
<p>(i) Cloud computing services shall be subject to the security requirements specified in the clause 252.239-7010, Cloud Computing Services, of this contract.</p>
<p>(ii) Any other such IT service or system (i.e., other than cloud computing) shall be subject to the security requirements specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(2) For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply:</p>
<p>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Special Publication (SP) 800-171, ``Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations'' (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171) in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(C) If the DoD CIO has previously adjudicated the contractor's requests indicating that a requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally effective, a copy of that approval shall be provided to the Contracting Officer when requesting its recognition under this contract.</p>
<p>(D) If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the Government for the Federal Risk<br />and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.</p>
<p>(3) Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2)<br />of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.</p>
<p>(c) Cyber incident reporting requirement.</p>
<p>(1) When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(i) Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractor's network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and</p>
<p>(ii) Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>
<p>(2) Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>

<p>(d) Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center<br />(DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.</p>
<p>(f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.</p>
<p><br />(g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent<br />practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.</p>
<p>(i) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD--</p>

<p>(j) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government's use and release of such information.</p>
<p>(k) The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.</p>
<p>(l) Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable<br />clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The<br />Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and</p>
<p>(2) Require subcontractors to--</p>
<p>(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR.

(ix) E.11  52.212-2  EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
  (a) All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel.  The Government intends to award without discussions upon the initial evaluation of proposals.
All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first evaluate the total proposed price of all Offerors.  Thereafter, the Government will evaluate the proposal of the lowest priced Offeror only.  If the lowest priced Offeror s proposal is determined to be acceptable, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further evaluation of the remaining Offerors  proposals.  If the lowest priced Offeror s proposal is determined to be unacceptable, then the Government may evaluate the next lowest priced proposal, and so forth and so on, until the Government reaches the lowest priced proposal that is determined to be Acceptable.  However, the Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  proposals should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation at any time. 
  (b) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
FACTOR # 1:  Technical Responsibility.  Candidate must meet all technical specifications identified within this solicitation. Particular attention must be given to the Performance Work Statement, Section 2   Qualifications.  Technical Responsibility  will be rated as a  Pass or Fail. 
Copies of the following shall be submitted with the proposal:  
(1) Full, active, current and unrestricted license in a State, Territory, Commonwealth of the United States, or in the District of Columbia. List the State(s) currently licensed to practice (provide certificates).  Note: Per the "PWS", must be professionally licensed in any state to prescribe controlled substances.  (Copy required)

       (2) Must have a Degree of Doctor of Medici ne or an equivalent degree       resulting from a cou rse of education in medicine or osteopathic medicine.
        (Copy required)

(3) Provide all malpractice related history. (if applicable   Copy or descriptive information required). 

(4) DEA Controlled Substance Registration Certificate. (Copy required)

(5) Complete training history. (Copy required   within CV)

(6) Must be Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certified and must maintain the certification throughout tenure with the WTVAHCS. (Copy required)

(7) Must be Basic Life Support (BLS) certified and must maintain the certification throughout tenure with the WTVAHCS. (Copy required)

(8) Curricula Vitae shall list three (3) references (name, title, address, 
telephone numbers & email address), including the current or last supervisor, that can validate professional  performance.

(9) Brief contingency plan detailing how firm (vendor) will ensure that a replacement physician is provided to cover absences of physicians so as to not interrupt patient care, quality of service and provide timely patient access.  (Copy required)

(10)  Company s quality control approach to ensure quality of care is achieved.  Note:  It is understood that some information within this area will duplicate entries within the contingency plan.  (Copy required)

FACTOR TWO (2)  CONTRACTOR S PAST PERFORMANCE

If a firm does not have relevant past performance as a Prime Contractor or a Sub-Contractor, it will not be held against the firm during the evaluation process. The past performance assessment will be subjective and will be evaluated using information gleaned from references provided (at least three) by the offeror as well as any other information available to the Government. Performance from the past Three (3) years will be rated.  Performance will be rated as a "Pass/ Fail".   Failing scores will have a full written justification and documented within the contract file.

FACTOR THREE (3) - PRICE

This solicitation will be evaluated as a  Lowest Price Technically Acceptable  (LPTA) procurement. Therefore, price shall serve as the highest weighted factor during the evaluation process. 
   
Award will be made using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable source selection process, on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305.  However, the comparative assessment in FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (i) does not apply.  Proposals will be evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors.
  (a) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

EVALUATION APPROACH
The award resulting from this solicitation will be made based on the best overall quote that is determined to be the most beneficial (i.e., best value) to the government, considering technical capability, past performance, and price. 
The government will evaluate information based on the procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.106-2 using the following evaluation criteria:

Technical Capability   The evaluation process will consider whether the quote demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the requirements of the solicitation.  

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government will evaluate price to determine whether or not it is considered fair and reasonable.

Past Performance   The quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the contractor s performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements similar in size, scope, and complexity to this solicitation. The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by the contractor.

All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. Consequently, contractors are highly encouraged to quote their best non-price and pricing quotes in their initial submissions. However, the Government reserves the right to communicate with any or all contractors submitting a quote, if it is determined advantageous to the Government to do so. If these communications take place, the Government is not obligated to communicate with every contractor (note that FAR Part 15 procedures do not apply; therefore formal discussions are not applicable). All contractors will be treated fairly and impartially. A contractor may be eliminated from consideration without further communication if its non-price and/or pricing quotes are not among those contractors considered most advantageous to the Government based on a best value determination.
Quotes that merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement shall be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Contractors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation shall be rated unacceptable and thus will be ineligible for award. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Satisfactory" must be achieved for the Technical Approach factor.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor quoting the lowest price, or to the contractor with the most highly rated technical quote. Award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote, if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to the merits of one or more of the non-price factors. 
All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Quotes must be submitted via electronic means by 3:00 P.M. ET on Thursday, December 14, 2017. Quotes must be submitted electronically via e-mail to susan.swanson3@va.gov. The quote must contain the contractor s name, address, telephone number, tax identification number, and Duns and Bradstreet Number.

Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP
Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b) (3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA242-18-1P-1325
1A. PROJECT/TASK No.
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

The Veterans Health Administration, Syracuse VAMC requires an Aquarius Urodynamic System to use for bladder function testing in evaluating bladder pressures, capacity, emptying, and flow. Determines necessity for further testing, operative procedures, and appropriate follow up. Approximately 9-11 urodynamic tests are performed weekly at this VA facility.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

The Aquarius urodynamic system is the only know system of its kind to have live annotation editing and compatibility with the current EMR system), so necessary changes can be done during the study, improving accuracy, avoiding having to go back after the study is completed to change event reporting, as would have to be done with the other brands.  Aquarius Urodynamic system also has HIPAA compliant software and exclusively provides reverse compatible software format allowing for retrospective viewing of all saved patient files. It also exclusively offers one package including wireless catheters, wireless EMG, wireless uroflow. Reports would go directly into CPRS, eliminating the delay caused by printing the studies, then sending them for scanning, which sometimes takes weeks. They would be available immediately in CPRS. Data is archived, encrypted, can be transferred from current equipment to new. 

4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Aquarius system was compared to Morpheus (similar product) as part of Market Research which was determined to not meet the requesters need due to non-compatibility with EMR system.  Searched of FBO and comparable products/sources was completed and sole source nature of this requirement has been found to be valid.  
5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.

<DESC><p>This notice is to inform interested parties of the cancellation of the Commercial Opportunity Notice (CON) for the Interim Combat Service Rifle (ICSR), under CON W15QKN-17-Z-0ANP due to a reprioritization of funding previously allocated for the ICSR.</p>
<p>Resulting from a change in strategy, the Government is reallocating the ICSR funding to the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW). The NGSW will be a long term solution to meet the identified capability gap instead of the ICSR, which was an interim solution.</p>
<p>It is requested that Offerors who have submitted bid samples under CON W15QKN-17-Z-0ANP contact below referenced Government point of contact (POC) for the return of their bid sample(s). Requests for Bid Sample returns will be processed as they are received and should begin to ship no earlier than mid-January 2018.</p>

simplified acquisition procedures. For quotations determined technically
acceptable and the vendor has an acceptable or neutral past performance, a
best value selection based on price and delivery will be made. An offeror will be determined technically acceptable if no exception is taken to the
specifications and requirements of the RFQ. Award will then be based on
price. Each offeror's quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.
Price will always be an important factor; therefore, offerors should make
diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced quotes. After
evaluating price, award may be made to other than the low offeror, when the
contracting officer determines it to be in the Government's best interest.
Documentation is required detailing product offered unless offering exact
items specified.<BR><BR>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>Contracting Officer's Authority.
The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<BR><BR>Insert the clause 1352.209â€“73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts.
As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507â€“2(c), insert the following clause:
Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010)
The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507â€“2(d), insert the following clause:
Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:
(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and
(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.
(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as â€œcontractorâ€) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.
(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<BR><BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms â€œcontract,â€ â€œcontractor,â€ and â€œContracting Officerâ€ shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507â€“1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106â€“2â€“70, insert the following provision:

Electronic and Information Technology (APR 2010)

(b) The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device, but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and devices so that it can be made accessible if so required by the agency in the future.
(c) Alternatively, offerors may propose products and services that provide equivalent facilitation. Such offers will be considered to have met the provisions of the Access Board standards for the feature or components providing equivalent facilitation. If none of the offers that meet all applicable provisions of the standards could be accepted without imposing an undue burden on the agency or component, or if none of the offerors propose products or services that fully meet all of the applicable Access Board's provisions, those offerors whose products or services meet some of the applicable provisions will be considered eligible for award. Awards will not be made to an offeror meeting all or some of the applicable Access Board provisions if award would impose an undue burden upon the agency.
(d) Offerors must submit representation information concerning their products by completing the VPAT template at http://www.Section508.gov .<BR><BR>Insert clause 1352.239â€“72, Security Requirements for Information Technology Resources, in all DOC solicitations and contracts for Information Technology services.

<DESC><p><br />COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION</p>
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotations (RFQ). Please reference solicitation number 1605DC-18-Q-00005 on all quotations. All quotations must list the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, DUNS, and Cage code.<br />(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94 and 95, dated January 19, 2017. <br />(IV) This is a brand name requirement. The NAICS code is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services. <br />(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial items and services: <br />Alertfind for 1 year for 4715 Recipients. Includes US or UK toll free hotline number fee for 1 phone number, Hotline Pro, 250 Pre-paid fax credit, 20,000 pre-paid SMS credit, 105,000 pre-paid voice credit</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired:</p>
<p>Basic Services. The contractor shall provide services for an Emergency Notification System to accommodate 4,715 users. The service must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year with no interferences of service. The system must be a user friendly web-based interface to work with all applicable devices (computer desktop, laptops, cellphones, desk phones, tablets, etc.) and operating systems (Microsoft, IOS, and Android). The system must have the capability to send text and voice alert messages over multiple communications devices. The system must give the government ability to receive responses of alert notification with full report capability and full archival access capability. Scheduled maintenance must be performed without any interference of service.</p>
<p>Essential Services. The Department of Labor has identified certain services under this requirement as being essential to the Department's missions and operations. Such essential services must continue to be performed, even if an event occurs (or is threatened to occur) that would disrupt or interfere with operations at, or access to, facilities where services ordinarily take place. Such an event may include, but is not limited to, emergencies that may be natural (e.g., earthquake, flood, hurricane, tornado, public health emergencies including pandemic influenza), man-made (e.g., civil unrest, chemical spill, cyber or terrorist threats or attacks), or technological (e.g., building fire, utility outage), and which may affect one or more facilities or locations, including federal facilities, where the Contractor normally performs services hereunder.</p>
<p>a) Contingency Plans. Unless already included in the requirement, within 30 days of the commencement of performance (or the bi-lateral incorporation of this clause), the Contractor shall submit the following contingency plans to the Contracting Officer (CO) and the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR):</p>
<p>1) A contingency plan to continue performance for a period of between one and thirty days; and<br />2) A contingency plan to continue performance for more than thirty days, until the event described above is resolved.<br />Such contingency plans will become an obligation of the Contractor under the requirement.</p>
<p>b) Contents of the Contingency Plans. The contingency plans referenced in paragraph (b) above shall, at a minimum, address:</p>
<p>1) How the Contractor plans to continue performance of essential services for the duration of an event, including identifying and securing suitable off-site workplaces, personnel, and resources;</p>
<p>2) Alert and notification procedures for mobilizing and communicating with the Department and with essential personnel, and for communicating expectations to its personnel regarding their roles and responsibilities during the event;</p>
<p>3) A list of telephone numbers and email addresses (with alternates if available) for all managers currently performing under the requirement; and</p>
<p>4) Processes and requirements for the identification, training, and preparedness of essential personnel who would be capable of relocating to alternate facilities or performing work from home.</p>
<p>c) Approval of the Contingency Plans. The CO, in consultation as appropriate with the COR, shall review both contingency plans within 14 days of receipt, or as agreed, and shall either accept them or advise the Contractor of any reason for disapproval. If either plan is not accepted by the CO, the Contractor shall resubmit a revised plan within 7 days, or as agreed.</p>
<p>d) Activation of a Contingency Plan. The Agency Head, CO, COR, or other authorized agency official, may activate the Contractor's Contingency Plan by notifying the Contractor either orally or in writing. In the event of an oral instruction, a written confirmation of the activation will follow shortly after the resumption of normal activities. Once a contingency plan has been activated, services hereunder shall continue without delay or interruption, notwithstanding the "Excusable Delay" Clause, or any other provision of the contract (or requirement if this contract vehicle is BPA, BOA, or similar vehicle).</p>
<p>e) Failure to Execute a Plan. In the event the Contractor is unable or unwilling to perform the essential services identified under the requirement, as determined by the Department in its sole discretion, the Department reserves the right, in addition to any other right it may have, to use federal employees or other contract support, either from existing contracts or new contracts, to continue those critical services. The Department may view the Contractor's failure to implement the Contingency Plan as not performing a contractual requirement and reserves all rights to seek remedies associated with any such nonperformance. Any new contracting efforts would be conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, OFPP's January 14, 2011 Emergency Acquisition Guide, or any other subsequent emergency guidance that may be issued.</p>
<p>f) Business Impact Analysis (BIA) Report. Contractor provides within 30 days of receipt, a report that demonstrates the process by analyzing mission-critical business functions, and identifies and quantifies the impact a loss of those functions (e.g., operational, financial) may have on the organization.</p>
<p>i. The BIA report should document the potential impacts resulting from disruption of business functions and processes. Scenarios resulting in significant business interruption should be assessed in terms of financial impact, if possible. These costs should be compared with the costs for possible recovery strategies.<br />ii. The BIA report should prioritize the order of events for restoration of the business.
