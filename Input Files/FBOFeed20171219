<SUBJECT>Repair Tainter Gates 1&2 at Amistad Dam, Texas
<SOLNBR>191BWC18B0002
<CONTACT>Philip K. Johnson, Phone 9158324714, Email philip.johnson@ibwc.gov
<DESC>Purpose of the Project
<p>The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) requires inspection, maintenance, repairs and testing of civil, mechanical &amp; electrical facilities and the hoist system/ platform for Tainter Gates number 1 and 2 at Amistad Dam is located about 15 miles from downtown Del Rio, TX.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Gate No. 2 is one of sixteen 50 feet by 50 feet Tainter Gates designed for spillway releases. The background to the required inspection, maintenance and repair of Tainter Gates number 1 and 2 under this contract is as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; In April 2015, a Grove TM 9120 Crane tipped onto its side and damaged the gate hoist assembly for Tainter Gate #2.<br />&bull; A visual inspection indicates that an oil feed line is bent and may have to be replaced. Also, the drive shaft from Gate #2 Gate Hoist to the Gate #2 Bull Gear (located on the Gate #3 Gate Hoist Platform, 50 feet away) is bent and must be repaired or replaced. <br />&bull; The hand rail and catwalk around Gate #2 hoist platform are missing; apparently, they were sheared off by the tipping crane and fell in the river. Currently there is no fall protection on Gate# 2 hoist platform.<br />&bull; The Limit Switch housing was broken during the crane incident and the Limit Switch and screw drive appear to have been damaged.<br />&bull; A spare Limit Switch housing, switches, and screw drive are available on site from decommissioned penstock gates hoists (penstock #4); and may be suitable to use for Tainter Gate No. 2.<br />&bull; Gate number 1 drive shaft support frame and support bearing have been impacted by the incident. They are to be inspected and repaired.<br />&bull; During subsequent attempts to remove the crane, a fire broke out damaging wiring in an electrical pull box, located in front of the Tainter Gate #2 platform. Replacement of wiring and cables damaged by the fire IS NOT part of this project. <br />&bull; The USACE conducted an inspection during September 2015 and provided recommendations for the electrical repairs. The report is summarized as "Amistad Electrical Evaluation Report."</p>

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is to post the synopsis for MTCCS. As of the date of this posting, all previous postings for this requirement can be found under solicitation number W900KK-15-R-0052. All future postings will be against W900KK-17-R-0001.
<p>Service Code is R425</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address:<br />12211 Science Dr.<br />Orlando, FL 32826-3224</p>
<p>Requirement Description:<br /><br />The effort includes services to support individual through collective training, leadership training and development, integrated Warfighter functions training, simulation supported training as well as network, security, and facilities management. This effort will consist of MTCCS at multiple hub and spoke locations throughout CONUS and OCONUS locations.</p>
<p>The MTCC requires support for individual through collective Mission Command training; Leadership Training/Development; Warfighter Functions (WFF) training; First Person Simulations (Gaming); and constructive simulations supported training as well as facilities management, event scheduling, security and administrative support, and access control. These training events may occur concurrently or separately. Events shall be combined into a simultaneous synthetic environment using the Live, Virtual, Constructive and Gaming (LVC-G) / Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) to create an Integrated Training Environment.</p>
<p>Hub and Spoke: Services will take place at Government locations. A Hub is an installation or training activity which acts as a regional or command-based center of gravity for individual and collective Mission Command (MC) training. For the Hub to provide the oversight and support necessary for sustaining consistent training objectives, it requires a larger training staff, training support systems, and training infrastructure (facilities, connectivity, etc.). It provides a focal point for simulations, interfaces, instruction for a majority of the MC systems, and centralized contract and funding oversight/management for the Hub and aligned Spokes. The Hub is authorized greater training resources than its Spokes. A Spoke is a smaller scale MC training capability and infrastructure which relies on the Hub (or Hub coordinated support from other Spokes) for low-density individual MC training support, collective training support in some instances, higher fidelity simulation and/or technical support, and contract/resource management. Spokes have adequate simulations, stimulations, MC system training and technical support to meet tenant unit day-to-day individual and collective training needs, but must coordinate with the Hubs for resources and technical and/or support for large event training such as Culminating Training Events (CTEs), Warfighter Exercises (WFXs), Mission Rehearsal Exercises (MRXs) and divisional battle staff training. Hub and Spoke, as it relates to MC training, is executed through an integrated, less hierarchical and more distributed training structure that extends throughout the Army.</p>

<DESC>The complexity of the ocean environment and operations therein has previously encouraged the use of exquisite systems to understand maritime dynamics and activity. The Ocean of Things program is an opportunity to provide affordable ocean sensing at large scales and high resolution. Improved maritime analysis provides detailed understanding of the ocean environment, informs regulatory commitments to protect natural resources, and enables the military to operate more effectively on the high seas.
<p><br />Ocean of Things provides environmental sensing and operational surveillance missions by composing a distribution of heterogeneous floats. Each float characterizes the physical environment through periodic sampling of local ocean properties, while also reporting significant maritime events. A primary technical objective of the program is to develop edge-processing methods to identify and report the essential information from these "interesting" events within a float's communication and energy constraints. Ocean of Things will also investigate the selection of sensors and sampling rates to maximize system performance. Additional hardware design efforts will seek to improve float persistence (i.e., motion control, biofouling reduction, and power control).</p>
<p>The stored reports must contain sufficient information for application of advanced processing techniques (e.g., filtering, clustering, and machine learning). Performers must utilize techniques to process this sparse data to develop vessel tracks, characterize vessel behaviors, and identify new signatures and signal associations in the collected data. Finally, Ocean of Things will research methods to visualize coverage, predict performance, and control individual floats to deliver resultant capabilities as a field comprised of thousands of floats.</p>

<p>This agency proposes to issue a solicitation for a long-term strategic/sole source contract which will include multiple NSNs to support the AH-64 weapon systems. A total of 24 NSNs are targeted to be added or repriced for this contract effort. The proposed sole source action will be issued to Boeing Company, Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE): 8V613 and is intended to be on a sole source basis as supported by a J&amp;A IAW FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". Items provided by the following Boeing CAGE codes covered by this acquisition: 32562, 022T1, 1GTA0, 18355, 4PF93, 48D66, 17765, 48T42, 0APX0, 0PXV4, 38YR6, 94756, 18441, 48BM4, 48LF5, 43999, 81205, 82918, 8V613, 76301 and 77272.</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP Weapons Systems Support is soliciting a spares requirement for a VANE COMPRESSOR AIR, NSN: 2840 995660020. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. MAR 2018 is the estimated award date of the resultant stand- alone contract.  
 
The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support manufacture or repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the government for procurement of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in manufacture or repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your copy of the cover letter forwarded with your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source, firm-fixed price contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(2)  Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 23 intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to EBSCO Publishing for EBSCOHost Database. VA requires the databases that are unique in the number of titles and breadth of subject matter contained in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) - Only One Source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the software and services are unique or proprietary to EBSCO Publishing, research revealed that EBSCO Publishing is unique in the number of titles and breadth of subject matter contained. The databases are mounted on a proprietary comprehensive search platform that integrates search strategies across the databases. A comparative search of these databases compared to single publisher databases (Wiley, Springer, Elsevier etc.) already covered by VA Library National Office database subscriptions has confirmed the highest level of complementary coverage. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 519130 and the service code is R605. 

While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The Government understands that EBSCO Publishing is the only vendor that can provide the requested EBSCOHost Database. However, vendors that believe they can provide the capabilities required to fully meet the Government's requirement may submit information in writing to Travis.Johnson2@va.gov within ten calendar days after publication of this notice. Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Armament Directorate (AFLCMC/EB) is conducting a market assessment to identify potential sources that may possess the capabilities to develop and deliver the algorithms and software code comprising a high-speed simulation model that generates the Launch Acceptable Region (LAR) and/or Weapon Engagement Zone (WEZ) ultimately to be displayed in the cockpits of combat aircraft to employ weapons. The anticipated software package would be compatible with and capable of integration with the Operational Flight Program (OFP) on weapon system platforms currently employed by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and allies.</p>
<p>AFLCMC/EB envisions a contract directly with the high-speed LAR/WEZ contractor to support its broad portfolio of developmental and fielded weapons, both air-to-air and air-to-ground, beginning in FY2019.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The high-speed simulation model of any LAR/WEZ would be developed based on weapon system developer simulation models of their respective weapon systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The outputs of the high-speed simulation model would be validated against weapon system performance, as demonstrated in test and evaluation, when appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The assumptions of the high-speed simulation model would reflect the agreements of the joint Launch Zone Integration Steering Group (LZISG) as captured in the most recent version of the Common Weapon Engagement Zone (CWEZ) Document.<span style="COLOR: red"> </span></p>

<DESC>This post has been created to publicize the establishment of qualification requirements (QRs) for the items listed in the Master Item List attached to this posting pursuant to FAR 9.204. Potential vendors wishing to become qualified as an approved source of repair/remanufacture for the items specified on the Master Item List must submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package in accordance with the requirements identified in the Repair/Remanufacture Qualification Requirements (RQR-848).<br /><br />This QR identifies the minimum requirements a vendor must exhibit for consideration as an approved source for the requested item. This QR covers a variety of different commodity items managed by the Air Force Sustainment Center within the 848th Supply Chain Management Group, part of the 448th Supply Chain Management Wing. These commodity items generally span structures, instruments, and accessory items for most of the major aircraft weapon systems currently operated by the Air Force. The Master Item List provides the item's National Stock Number, catalog noun, Repair Method Code/Repair Method Suffix Code, and 4-year projected requirements (projected requirements are subject to change).<br /><br />The Master Item List is divided between those items where Government provided technical data is available (typically in the form of repair/overhaul Technical Orders) and those that do not have Government provided technical data. Gaining access to the necessary technical data is specified in the RQR-848 (see section 9).<br /><br />Pertinent contact information is contained within Appendix F of the RQR-848.<br /><br />All of the items listed on the Master Item List are Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Category (ERRC) Code "T" and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 336413.<br /><br />For a list of projected requirements (in addition to those specified on the Master Item List) and other opportunities, please visit the Strategic Alternate Sourcing Program Office (SASPO) website at http://www.tinker.af.mil/Home/429SCMSSASPO.aspx.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only and is not a solicitation for proposals. The purpose of this announcement is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business firms. Responses to this Source Sought will be used by the government in making appropriate acquisition decisions. The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Fort Eustis intends to procure contract construction services for the West Point Directorate of Public Works (DPW), New York.
<p>This Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (MAIDIQ) contract will be used for a broad range of maintenance, repair, and alteration projects. Inclusive are maintenance, repair, remodeling, renovation and minor new construction that may include incidental design services. Design-Bid-Build is the most traditional process in the U.S. construction industry, where the owner contracts separately with a designer and a contractor. Design/build is when an owner typically hires a single entity, the design/builder, to perform both design and construction under a single contract. The Government is seeking a company to provide Design/build for this requirement, but however, Design-Bid-Build may be used with drawings and specifications created under a separate Architect/Engineer contract. Those drawings and specifications will be used as the bid documents in the construction contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all parts, labor, plant, equipment, material, supplies, supervision, management, transportation, and all other requirements to perform all projects. Covering a broad range of maintenance, repair, and new and minor construction work, as well as design-build projects on real property to support the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) at West Point Military Academy, New York utilizing an MAIDIQ. Task Orders (TOs) shall vary in size ranging from $2K to approximately $5M. The ceiling amount for this requirement is $100M, and the guaranteed minimum is $2,000 for the base period only.</p>
<p>West Point DPW requires various support services as shown in "Attachment 1 - SOW" for the follow on contracts to the current Multiple Award, Task Order contracts at West Point NY. The magnitude of all Task orders for the current contracts are more than 10,000,000.</p>
<p>Specifically, MICC intends to gain market knowledge of potential 8(a) small business sources relative to a requirement that, at this time, will be under the following NAICS Code:</p>
<p>236220 -- Commercial and Institutional Building Construction<br />Small Business Size Standard: Not to exceed $36,500,000.00 gross annual receipts</p>
<p>NOTE: If, after reviewing the draft Statement of Work (SOW), your firm believes another NAICS code is more appropriate, provide the rationale and justification.</p>
<p>After review of the responses to this Sources Sought announcement a synopsis and/or solicitation announcement may be published at a later time.</p>
<p>Please provide a capability statement addressing your organization's ability to perform as a prime contractor for the functional areas and advise the government of areas that your company would subcontract or partner. All work shall be performed on real property located in facilities assigned to New York U.S. Military Academy West Point, NY and at Stewart Army Sub Post, New Windsor, NY. Capability statements in response to this notice shall include the following information and shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages:</p>
<p>a) Company name, address, CAGE code, and points of contact with telephone numbers and email addresses.</p>
<p>b) Business size/classification in regard to NAICS 236220, to include socioeconomic designation of 8(a) companies.<br /><br />c) Number of Employees.</p>
<p>d) Average revenue for the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>e) Resources to include your company's growth capabilities and amount of established line of credit.</p>
<p>f) Description of firm's capability to provide the specified support and support services including communication of technical expertise. Capabilities must be presented in sufficient detail in order for the Government to determine if the company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to provide nonpersonal services for the nine functional areas mentioned in this notice.</p>
<p>g) Past performance/experience on contracts of similar scope (relevancy) that are within the last three (3) years (recency) of the issue date of this announcement. Past experience should include project title, location, general description of the services provided, the company's role, the dollar value, and name of the company/agency/Government entity for which the work was performed.</p>
<p>h) We are currently anticipating multiple awards of Indirect Quantity/Indirect Delivery contracts with Firm Fixed Price Task Orders for this action. Following contract award, what transition period do you feel would be adequate to start processing task orders?</p>
<p>i) We are anticipating providing a Sample Task Order for pricing the action with the solicitation. Does this strategy sound adequate to provide a firm fixed-price effort?</p>
<p>j) We are anticipating issuing Requests for Task Order Proposals using a SOW. What risks do you foresee with this approach and how would you mitigate those risks?</p>
<p>It is imperative that businesses responding to this sources sought announcement articulate their capabilities clearly and adequately regarding each functional area listed. Industry input is also requested on the DRAFT SOW that is attached. Questions and/or feedback related to the SOW MUST be submitted as a separate document.</p>
<p>Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition and identify alternatives or solution solutions. Also contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-<br />466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the Sources Sought Synopsis. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />W911SD-18-P-0029 <br />REFUSE AND RECYCLING AT WEST POINT<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government currently intends to award a BRIDGE contract for REFUSE AND RECYCLING SERVICES on an SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.
<p>The proposed sole source Firm Fixed Price contract to Donato Marangi Inc. is for refuse and recycling collection at the United States Army Garrison, West Point. This will be for a period of time up to 60 days from the date of award. This will only be issued if the current solicitation W911SD-17-R-0008 is not awarded in sufficient time to continue the refuse and recycling operations at West Point on 1 February 2018. A solicitation #W911SD-17-R-0008 for a Base Plus 4 Option Year period contract for refuse and recycling has been issued for this requirement and will close on 12 January 2018 and an award is expected to be made with an effective start date of 1 February 2018. If a resultant award will be issued from W911SD-17-R-0008 and it will be in effect on 1 February, then no further Sole Source Awards will be required.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is e.g., 10 United States Code 2304(c)(1) as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Attached are the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) and Technical Exhibits with workload data (for services).</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code(s) is/are: 562111 Solid Waste Collection, $38.5 Million size standard.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing microwave atmospheric water vapor and temperature monitoring radiometer system that can be user-located and user-relocated to a variety of different high altitude astronomical observatory locations, such as Cerro Paranal in Chile (2635 m altitude) or Mauna Loa in Hawaii (3394 m altitude), and be pointed by the user towards the stars or the moon. NIST's Physical Measurements Laboratory (PML) Remote Sensing Group of the NIST Sensor Science Division intends to use this on a project to use an optical/infrared telescope system to make accurate spectral and radiometric measurements of the light from certain standard stars.</p>
<p>After market research results are obtained and analyzed, minimum requirements specifications for the microwave atmospheric water vapor and temperature monitoring radiometer system will be established. NIST may use these established specifications in conducting a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order in the future. If a minimum of two (2) qualified small businesses are identified during market research stage, then any resulting competitive procurement may be considered for a small business set-aside.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334515, as those domestic sources with 750 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Product Requirements: </strong><br />The intent is for this system to be used alongside an astronomical telescope, and pointed at the same star (or moon) as the telescope, to monitor the atmospheric conditions along the optical path to the star (or moon) during nearly clear-sky, low-humidity, nighttime conditions. The system will usually be outside during operation. It will often also remain outside during periods of non-operation, and exposed to a much wider range of weather conditions than those encountered during its use for measurements, and it therefore must be able to survive, but not operate, when exposed to weather conditions that include events such as rain, fog, wind, and snow. Specific minimum performance requirements for the microwave radiometer system, that must all be met at the same time, are:<br /><br />1.	Must include a sufficient number of microwave channels that sample the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line for atmospheric water vapor determination.<br /><br />2.	Must include a sufficient number of microwave channels that sample the 55 GHz oxygen absorption line for atmospheric temperature determination.<br /><br />3.	Must have a field of view about the line of sight, defined as the angle subtended between the half-power points, of 5 degrees or finer, and the water vapor and temperature channels must be co-aligned within this field of view.<br /><br />4.	Must include retrieval algorithms, written in delivered software, that compute the total precipitable water vapor (PWV) content, in units of mm of water, of the atmospheric column along the line of site above the microwave radiometer, from the microwave radiometer measurements, as well as water vapor and temperature profiles at zenith.<br /><br />5.	Must measure total PWV in the range of 0 mm to 20 mm without saturation.<br /><br />6.	Must measure total PWV in the range of 0 mm to 9 mm with uncertainty of +/- 0.1 mm (coverage factor k=1 see Note 2 below).<br /><br />7.	Must measure atmospheric temperature profiles at zenith with a spatial resolution of 1 km and uncertainty of +/- 1 kelvin (k=1).<br /><br />8.	Must measure water vapor profiles at zenith with a spatial resolution of 1 km and uncertainty of +/- 0.5 g/m3 (k=1).<br /><br />9.	Must include a computer-controlled motorized elevation stage to provide pointing of the microwave radiometer line of sight at any user-controlled elevation angle from zenith to either horizon (180 degrees), having 0.2 degree step-size (or finer) and 10 degrees per second (or faster) slew rate.<br /><br />10.	Must include a computer-controlled motorized azimuth stage to provide pointing of the microwave radiometer line of sight at any user-controlled azimuth angle (in the range 0 to 360 degrees) in the plane normal to zenith having 0.2 degree step-size (or finer) and 10 degrees per second (or faster) slew rate.<br /><br />11.	Must include an infrared radiometer, operating in the 10 micrometer atmospheric transmittance window, that is co-aligned with the microwave radiometer line of site and provides an indication of thin high cirrus clouds in the field of view, having a sensitivity limit below -100 degrees centigrade, a noise level below 0.5 kelvin, and a brightness temperature uncertainty of +/ 1 kelvin (k=1).<br /><br />12.	Must include a portable computer (PC), operating on the Windows 10 or higher version operating system, that provides remote (via ethernet connection to the microwave radiometer) and automated control, data acquisition, retrieval algorithm processing, data display, and data recording. The PC must control the azimuth and elevation stage angle and the azimuth stage angle, and acquire raw data from the microwave radiometer and infrared radiometer, and process the data into calibrated total PWV, water vapor profile, and temperature profile data.<br /><br />13.	The microwave radiometer control software running on the PC must enable the user to automate the process of scanning the microwave radiometer line of sight to track a given star or the Moon as it moves across the sky due to Earth rotation during the night. If the control software does not have star-tracking software built in, it must have a dynamically-linked library (DLL), or the equivalent, to enable the user to programmatically (i.e. automatically using a user-provided program, rather than just interactively from the front panel) input updated values of elevation angle and azimuth angle at least once per minute to track the star through the night. In this case the user would provide and install user-provided software on the PC, which computes the elevation and azimuth angles, then sends them to the control software DLL for updating to these elevation angle and azimuth angles. <br /><br />14.	During operation at any fixed elevation and azimuth angle, the microwave radiometer must complete a new water vapor and temperature measurement every minute or less. The uncertainties for the measurements stated above apply to 1 minute measurement time per line of sight.<br /><br />15.	Must include an internal calibration source that maintains the radiance temperature calibration of the microwave radiometer at the uncertainty levels specified above through the night during operation.<br /><br />16.	Must include an external calibration source that provides full-aperture radiance temperature calibration of the microwave radiometer against a black body spectrum at the liquid-nitrogen boiling-point temperature.<br /><br />17.	Must operate outside of any buildings, at mountain top astronomical observatories at night, at altitudes up to 3400 m, with commensurate reduced barometric pressure.<br /><br />18.	Must include an enclosure and heater system for the microwave radiometer that controls the receiver temperature to a fixed point to within +/- 0.1 centigrade, while the outside temperature varies through night within the range of -30 degrees centigrade to 30 degrees centigrade, and keeps the system dry and protected in the event of rain, fog, snow, and wind.<br /><br />19.	Must operate on less than 400 W of electrical power in the range of 90 to 230 Volts Alternating Current (VAC), 50 Hz to 60 Hz.<br /><br />20.	Must fit inside of a box measuring 1 m x 1 m x 1 m, excluding stand, external calibration source, and PC.<br /><br />21.	Must weigh less than 100 kg. <br /><br />22.	Must include training of one to four NIST staff on the operation of the microwave radiometer and all associated hardware and software prior to delivery. Notification of the proposed training date(s) and location must be made by the vendor at least 60 days prior to the training date(s), and the date(s) must be agreed upon by the NIST contracting officer prior to scheduling.</p>
<p><br />Note 1: By "passive," it is meant that the system measures the amount of the naturally-emitted microwave radiation from water and oxygen in the atmosphere that enters the radiometer, and infers the amount of water vapor and temperature from these measurements. The term "passive" is used to distinguish the system from an "active" system, which would supply the radiation and measure the return.<br /><br />Note 2: Accuracy specifications are stated in terms of uncertainty at a coverage factor k = 1, where this is defined by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as including both the systematic (bias) component of uncertainty and the random (root-mean-square, RMS) component of uncertainty, and corresponds to a 68 % confidence level. It is the equivalent of a 1-sigma uncertainty for a uniform (i.e. Gaussian) probability distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Instruction to Responders: </strong><br />Companies that are capable of providing this microwave atmospheric water vapor and temperature monitoring radiometer system are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to tracy.bisson@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1.	Name of the company(s) that offer the required supply. In addition, provide a point of contact for the company(s).</p>

<DESC><strong>I.	INTRODUCTION<br /></strong><br /><strong>A.</strong> About the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations<br />The Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) directs the worldwide overseas building program for the Department of State and the U.S. Government community serving abroad under the authority of the chiefs of mission. In concert with other State Department bureaus, foreign affairs agencies, and Congress, OBO sets worldwide priorities for the design, construction, acquisition, maintenance, use, and sale of real properties and the use of sales proceeds. OBO's mission is to provide safe, secure and functional facilities that represent the U.S. government to the host nation and support our staff in the achievement of U.S. foreign policy objectives.<br /><br />
<p>As the single real property manager for the U.S. Government's diplomatic facilities abroad, OBO's  portfolio spans 275 diplomatic posts in every region of the world. To achieve the multifaceted mission described above, OBO and its global customers depend on receiving the right data, services, and products at the right time. To succeed in this mission, OBO must be an integrated enterprise.<br /><br /><strong>B.</strong> About the OBO Ideal Operational State Program<br />OBO established the Ideal Operational State (IOS) program to improve information management, data accuracy, and business processes throughout the Bureau's real property portfolio. The overarching goal of IOS is to ensure that data-accessible from Washington, D.C. or anywhere around the world-is ready, reliable, and relevant at any point in the OBO real property lifecycle. Access to this data will enable OBO and the Department of State to improve on existing data-driven decision processes.</p>
<p>A major component of the IOS program is the implementation of an integrated enterprise system of record that will provide unified, accurate, and easily accessible data on all OBO projects. The rollout of this system will affect thousands of users at OBO and at posts worldwide. OBO will ensure the functionality and interoperability of this system through the implementation requirements below: <br /><br />&bull;	Maximize integration <br />&bull;	Minimize customization <br />&bull;	Maximize speed to implementation <br />&bull;	Support defined business processes <br />&bull;	Maximize data availability <br /><br />Considering the size of OBO's real property portfolio, along with the number, variety, and location of customers that rely on OBO services, the IOS program represents a substantial operational and organizational shift in OBO's current business practices. As such, the IOS implementation period may last 10 years or more, with sustainment and iterative improvement of the program continuing in perpetuity.</p>
<p><strong>C. </strong>Need for Independent Verification and Validation Services<br />OBO is requesting information on independent verification and validation (IV&amp;V) services to ensure that the IOS program management office (PMO) aligns with industry best practices in program management. OBO also requires IV&amp;V services to assess the quality and accuracy of IOS program deliverables. <br /><br />The scope of this work will include all activities required to independently verify and validate program management tasks and deliverables related to the full life of the IOS program-from standing up the PMO to system implementation to program sustainment strategy. The scope also includes recommending improvements to activities and tasks that occur under the IOS program.</p>
<p>These tasks and activities under the IOS program will occur in the following functional areas: <br /> <br />1.	Task order management and administration<br />2.	Program management<br />3.	Integrated schedule management<br />4.	Business process gap analysis<br />5.	Risk management<br />6.	Communications<br />7.	Organizational change <br />8.	Training<br />9.	Budget management<br />10.	Quality management<br />11.	Resource management<br />12.	Strategy development<br />13.	System implementation and integration testing<br />14.	System release and migration<br />15.	Requirements management<br />16.	Configuration management<br />17.	Scope management<br />18.	Enterprise architecture<br />19.	Data quality <br />20.	Data migration</p>
<p>The IV&amp;V contractor will participate in the program as a member of the PMO, working closely with the government program manager and the PMO support contractor.</p>
<p><strong>II.	SCOPE OF OBJECTIVES</strong><br />This section outlines a scope of objectives based on OBO subject matter experts' existing knowledge of IV&amp;V services and how OBO stakeholders envision an IV&amp;V contractor will participate in the IOS PMO. <br />As mentioned above, the IV&amp;V contractor would participate regularly in IOS program activities. This level of participation would likely result in regular collaboration among the IOS government program manager, the IOS program support contractor, and the IOS IV&amp;V contractor. OBO welcomes feedback on the below process. <br /><br /><strong>1.0	Conduct IV&amp;V Services</strong></p>
<p>1.1	Assess whether IOS program activities and deliverables align to industry best practices under the functional areas listed in section I, subsection C of this RFI.  <br />1.2	Assess whether the accuracy of resourcing estimates, level-of-effort estimates, and scheduling estimates for IOS program activities align with past industry experience.   <br />1.3	Assess IOS program management activities, processes, and deliverables for strategic and operational viability for OBO and Department-wide goals.     <br />1.4	Assess the fit of proposed solutions relative to organizational objectives, assess and inform the functional approach of proposed solutions, and identify potential risks and risk mitigation strategies appropriate to OBO- and Department-wide environments.<br />1.5	Recommend solutions for instances when IOS program activities do not align with industry best practices or when planning estimates (scheduling, resourcing, costing, etc) do not align with industry experience.  <br />1.6	Ensure that any assessment or recommendation takes into consideration the unique organizational structure of the State Department, especially as this structure pertains to existing processes and systems at both OBO and the 275 different overseas diplomatic posts.</p>
<p><strong>2.0	Provide Program Management Support</strong></p>
<p>2.1	Support IOS weekly and monthly activity reporting, to include accomplishments, key issues and hourly burn.<br />2.2	Provide contract management support for the primary IOS program management support contract, to include delivery of a program management plan consistent with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). <br />2.3	Monitor risk and update risk management processes.<br />2.4	Monitor program performance and update program performance metrics.<br />2.5	Monitor and assess the accuracy of IOS monthly financial summary reports.  <br />2.6	Provide program management support to IOS to include financial management, maintenance of the basis of estimate, task management, resource management, project planning and management, and performance management.  <br />2.7	Provide program management support to IOS financial management activities including budget planning, monthly cost and schedule performance, and program funding.<br />2.8	Provide earned value management (EVM) reports for the IOS program.	<br />2.9	Provide independent advice on requirements for the IOS program.  The contractor shall also provide independent advice on proposals submitted in response to solicitations for services to fulfill IOS program requirements.</p>
<p><strong>III.	PREREQUISITES</strong><br />At this time, there is no requirement for a facility security clearance or cleared staff under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). However, if a respondent participates in the NISP and has facility and personnel clearances, that information should be provided in the response.<br /><br /><strong>IV.	QUESTIONS</strong><br />1.	Does your company have experience providing IV&amp;V services to the State Department? If so, how large was the project for which you provided IV&amp;V services? What kind of project was it? How many users did the project affect?</p>
<p>2.	As mentioned in Section II, the IOS program will require expertise in managing organizational change and transformation. Does your company have experience providing IV&amp;V services for programs that would result in a similar level of organizational change, and for a multinational organization that is analogous in size and scope to OBO? If so, please describe this experience.</p>
<p>3.	What is your company's approach to providing IV&amp;V services while also participating as an active member in a program management office?</p>
<p>4.	Based on the above description (in Sections I and II) of the OBO Ideal Operational State program, what would be the level of effort required to provide IV&amp;V services for the initial ten-year period of the IOS program? And what would be the level of effort for only providing IV&amp;V services to the program management office?</p>
<p>5.	What experience does your company have in providing IV&amp;V services to organizations that are implementing the following software products:</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>a.	Integrated workplace management system (IBM TRIRIGA)<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>b.	Content management system (OpenText)<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>c.	Budget management system (product TBD)<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>d.

STATEMENT OF WORK


INTRODUCTION. Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) requires a qualified contractor to perform maintenance & service of the existing Building Automation System (BAS) for the entire Tucson campus. The main BAS controls the operations of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system throughout the SAVAHCS campus. It senses air flows and temperatures and controls the operations of the chillers, fans, pumps, louvers and other HVAC components in response to preset instructions and parameters. The main BAS also monitors some potable water systems as well as the parking lot lighting and generator systems. A separate, smaller BAS accomplishes a similar and more limited function for buildings 80 and 90. The SAVAHCS campus is located in at 3601 South 6th Avenue Tucson, Arizona 85723.

This contract will be for a Base Year and Four (4) Option Years.

SCOPE. The purpose of this contract is to secure materials and the qualified technical labor that is required for the successful maintenance and service of the existing BAS systems at the SAVAHCS campus. 

The current BAS used at SAVAHCS is Metasys, except for Buildings 80 and 90 which are on the Alerton BAS.  The scope of this work includes both the Metasys and Alerton BASs.

WORK TO BE PERFORMED UNDER THIS CONTRACT

The contractor shall provide the anticipated two-month look-ahead schedule for the BAS technician to the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) within 5 business days from the start of each month.
At least one week prior to the preventative maintenance visit, the contractor shall coordinate the visit (i.e., date, work schedule, and anticipated tasks) with the COR either by telephone or by e-mail.  If the coordination is done by phone, within one business day of the phone discussion, the contractor shall send an e-mail to the COR documenting the details of the upcoming visit (i.e., date, work schedule, and anticipated tasks).
Obtain all possible information from the BAS that will facilitate accomplishment of the preventive maintenance tasks required.
Weekly Site Trip Report.  Refer to Deliverables, Item 1.

The contractor will advise SAVAHCS on what preparations need to be made for each visit and what data should be made available to the BAS technician, in preparation for that visit.   When needed, SAVAHCS technicians will aid the BAS technician to perform tasks.

These tasks shall include, but not limited to:
Replacement of all DDC controls equipment that has failed or is defective. 
The BAS technician shall identify to the COR any defective parts or equipment in the BAS that require replacement because it has failed or is about to fail. 
The contractor is responsible to have in-stock or have the ability to provide all necessary parts, components, assemblies, modules, and equipment to restore any failed or defective equipment to full performance within 24 calendar hours of identification.
Full performance is defined as:  all failed or defective parts have been replaced with parts equivalent to or better than the original parts and meets or exceeds the manufacturer s original performance specifications.
The contractor shall supply and bear the cost of all parts, lubricants, cleaning supplies, and tools required for preventive maintenance and, as a result of normal wear and tear, restore equipment to full performance.

<DESC>This is Sources Sought announcement only   this is not a Request for Quote. The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research and obtain information from qualified vendors with special interest.  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.

The appropriate NAICS Code is 339113   Surgical Appliance & Supplies Manufacturing 

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 2, and the VA Medical Center in Syracuse, NY anticipate a purchase order for the following:   MFG - Maquet

0998-00-0800-53              CARDIOSAVE Hybrid and one (1) year warranty Product includes CARDIOSAVE Blood Pressure Transducer Adapter Cable CARDIOSAVE ECG Trunk Cable   5 lead  AAMI CARDIOSAVE ESIS Lead Wires 50"  5 Lead (Op Rm) - AAMI Helium   3 refillable tanks, 104L Ex Available 24/7 Remote Support via Win-IABP

ZSUSGDCSVEW5           CARDIOSAVE   MCare Gold Pin   POSEW5Y 2 Each 

0998-00-0803            CARDIOSAVE Trainer                                                           2 Each  

Required Salient Characteristics
A transport modality which decreases the units weight from 114lbs to 53lbs for transporting of the patient. This allows for easier movement of patient between units and onto ambulances or airtransport for hospital to hospital movement. Less weight also means lower risk of staff back or other injury. 
A one button start with no warm up period or manuel zeroing required which decreases time to start therapy and minutes matter in the situations this will be used. 
Automatic condensation removal. Other systems have a liquid collection jar that must be manually emptied.
3 hour Lithium ion batteries which are  hot swappable  meaning they can be changed out without shutting the unit down or plugging it in during transport.
An auto-lock screen feature which automatically locks the screen after 2 minutes, preventing accidental changing of settings which could be devastating.
Cardiosave performs an in-vivo calibrationthat is an indepth zeroing process which takes place inside the patients body. This is done on start up and every 2 hours and on change in patient condition. Other units do not perform any repeat calibration at all. 
Cardiosave uses a scroll compressor  which has faster inflate/deflate times. This allows for motor speed to be controlled based on the demand of the patients heart; it ramps its rate up and down based on changes in heart rate. Competition has speed delays because of older bellows technology.
Cardiosave automatically replaces helium lost from diffusion.

This procurement is for new items only; no remanufactured or "gray market" items.  FOB - destination

Interested vendors are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.12, prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with FAR 4.11 required registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a contract.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to conduct market research and determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses (including the following subsets, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HUBZone Firms; Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Woman Owned Small Business) to provide the required products and/or services.
<p>DISCLAIMER: <br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Contract Number: M00264-17-C-0024<br />Contract Type: FFP<br />Incumbent and their size: QUANTICS Incorporated 211 Welsh Pool Road Suite 130<br />Exton, PA 193416<br />Method of previous acquisition: Full and open competition<br />Business Size: Small</p>
<p><br />This scope of effort specifies the technical and program requirements to develop United States Marine Corps Non-Nuclear Ordnance Requirements (USMCNNOR) Class V (W) in accordance with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Office of the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) guidance. Support the Logistics Integration Division (LID), Capabilities Development Directorate (CDD), Deputy<br />Commandant Combat Development &amp; Integration (DC CD&amp;I).</p>
<p>Anticipate 12 months of support with at least 4 Option Periods. Preponderance of support will be offsite at contractor facilities with limited onsite support at Capabilities Development Directorate (CDD), Quantico, VA.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>
<p>1. The United States Marine Corps (USMC), as required by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), quantifies munitions requirements in accordance with DoD Instruction 3000.04, Department of Defense Munitions Requirements Process (DoD MRP). DoD Instruction 3000.04 establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for generating, developing, and disseminating DoD MRP products. It is DoD policy to establish a Total Munitions Requirement (TMR), with guidance from Secretary of Defense Memorandum, "Guidance for the Development of the Force (GDF)", Secretary of Defense Memorandum, "Guidance for the Employment of the Force (GEF)", and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD (AT&amp;L)) Memorandum, "DoD MRP Implementation Guidance (DoD MRP IG)" that arm military forces to perform their assigned military missions. Additionally, it is incumbent upon the Services to ensure that munitions requirements developed are visible, accessible, and understandable to the rest of the Department (except where limited by law, policy, or security classification).</p>
<p>2. The USMC, through the Munitions Requirements Class V (W) process, determines the USMC's munitions inventory requirements. The purpose of the MCMRP Class V (W) process is to develop munitions requirements for the USMC ground forces in accordance with the DoD MRP. The requirements are used to develop munitions procurement and maintenance plans and justification of budget requests in the services Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution process (PPBE).</p>
<p>3. The MCMRP methodology is compliant with the DoD MRP which currently defines the TMR as the sum of the War Reserve Munitions Requirement (WRMR) and the testing and training requirement (TTR). The WRMR is defined as the sum of combat requirement (CR), current operations / forward presence requirements (CO/FPR), and strategic readiness requirement (SRR). Aligned to the component requirements definitions in the DoD MRP, USMC CR consists of munitions required to equip a specified force structure to its designated military capability to meet Combatant Commander requirements in accordance with DoD guidance; CO/FPR consists of munitions required to arm forces to conduct current operations and meet forward presence obligations in accordance with the GEF; SRR consists of munitions needed to arm forces not committed to support combat operations in the assigned major combat operations, as well as those in the strategic reserve, and any additional munitions requirements generated from treaties or statutory obligations to allies; and TTR consists of munitions needed to train the force and test weapon systems. These elements may change as guidance is updated.</p>
<p>4. The requirements for those weapons included in the MCMRP process are computed by the contractor under the purview of the Logistics Integration Division (LID). Inputs include scenario descriptions and force employments, weapon inventories, platform and weapon capabilities, weapon Initial Operating Capability (IOC) date, targets, target priorities, and mission parameters and tactics. Most of the requirements are threat-based; however, some are Level-of-Effort (LOE) requirements. Threat-based MCMRP computations are based on destroying the enemy threat allocated to the USMC (ground side only). LOE munitions computations provide weapons to sustain a specific number of days of combat and are the product of rounds per shooter per day, number of shooters, and number of days.</p>
<p>5. Computer models have been developed to assist in developing inventory requirements. Currently there are three over-arching computer models in the MCMRP modeling suite. They are the WRMR model, Ammunition Funding Analyzer (AFA), and the Requirements Generator (ReqGen). The MCMRP Class V (W) modeling suite is operational on Personal Computers (PC's) and has been provided with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to simplify use.</p>
<p>6. In fulfilling the requirements specified herein, the services shall demand ingenuity, creativity, careful attention to detail and sound study. Where appropriate, the Contractor shall provide recommendations to the Government on how to make the MCMRP process and products more meaningful and operationally relevant. The Contractor shall support all MCMRP MRP/POM cycles in progress during the period(s) of performance. The procedures of execution within each of these MCMRP cycles may be similar and overlapping, yet could change drastically. The Contractor must be able to quickly adapt to these changes.</p>
<p>7. The Contractor shall attend and support combatant command Phased Threat Distribution working groups, typically 1-2 per year. This requires in-depth knowledge and understanding of targets, weaponeering, target pairing, munitions capabilities and effects, and USMC capabilities. The Contractor shall ensure that threat data is entered into the models and a detailed analysis of the MRP threat allocations is used to prepare MRP change recommendations. Any discussions, issues, assumptions, methodology, and database changes related to the models shall be documented and taken for action if directed by the LID. Provide this information in the form of Minutes to the LID within 5 working days of conference conclusion.</p>
<p>8. Munitions requirements generation will require the Contractor to ensure databases and models (WRMR, ReqGen, and AFA) are updated with all applicable information to determine combat expenditures and combat loads for the various forces. Contractor shall coordinate with all required entities for data inputs required to develop the Total Munitions Requirement and all associated reports. All products and corresponding documentation will be furnished to the Contractor as Government Furnished Information (GFI). All changes to the models and the methodologies that the Contractor makes shall be thoroughly tested and documented in the Total Munitions Requirement (TMR). Models are subject to being verified, validated and accredited.</p>
<p>9. Once all MRP change recommendations are adjudicated by competent authority, the Contractor shall make computations and prepare an output brief, which details the results and change recommendations to the LID for approval. Afterwards, the Contractor shall compute the POM requirements after inclusion of any considerations is made in order to prepare and forward a final requirements package for signature. Additionally, the Contractor shall develop a Total Munitions Assessment and Sufficiency Assessment (TMA/SA), as directed by OSD or Joint Staff, which must validate that the TMR is sufficient to support the entire Marine Corps ground munitions requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p><br />The Contractor shall be required to store, access and handle unclassified and classified (SECRET) information and documentation. Overarching security requirements and Contractor access to classified information shall be specified in the DD-254 form. Security management efforts, inclusive of retention of clearances and document handling and storage, are not to be charged to the Government and should be considered part of the Contractor's indirect labor base. The Government will not be responsible for getting subcontract companies cleared through any security measures. The Government will sponsor the Contractor's access to other Government facilities as required. Additional Contractor badging requirements will be delineated on the DD-254. The Contractor shall access Communication Security (COMSEC) information and Secured Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet) at their facilities.</p>

 Notice:

DISCLAIMER:  This Request for Expressions of Interest ( REI ) is a notice of a potential opportunity and not a solicitation for offers or request for proposals.  Respondents are advised that the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) assumes no responsibility to award an Enhanced-Use Lease ( EUL ) based upon responses to this REI.  Should VA decide to issue a request for proposals, a formal Solicitation for Offers will be issued. 

The purpose of this REI is to identify potential sources for information and planning purposes only, and is not intended to prequalify or disqualify any potential respondents. This REI is intended to conduct market research to determine if responsible and qualified sources exist to redevelop the assets described in Section III.   

The information gained from this REI will be used to assist VA in determining if this development opportunity can be competitive and/or a total Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business ( SDVOSB ) or Veteran Owned Small Business ( VOSB ) set-aside (collectively, SDVOSBs and VOSBs are referred to below as  Small Business  or  Small Businesses ).  Additionally, VA will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for a potential procurement. 

Only Small Businesses are requested to respond to this REI.  

VA requests that interested parties respond to this REI by identifying their status as a Small Business and providing the specific information requested in Section IV.  

Respondents to this REI should be aware that their response will not ensure qualification for any underlying future solicitation award.  Furthermore, VA will not pay for any costs incurred by potential respondents when responding to, or as a result of, this REI.

Scope and Objectives:  

VA, under its EUL authority (38 U.S.C.  8161 - 8169) is seeking Expressions of Interest ( EI ) from qualified Small Businesses for an opportunity to redevelop/renovate Buildings 1,10,62, and 69 on the historic VA Medical Center campus located at the Central Alabama Health Care System, Tuskegee ( VAMC ) in Tuskegee, Alabama.  The EUL authority allows VA to outlease land and improvements to select developers for the purpose of financing, renovating, operating, and maintaining permanent supportive housing units and onsite community based support services for Veterans and their families who are homeless or who are at risk of homelessness.  The EUL program allows for the long-term lease (up to 75 years) of facilities to public or private sector lessees, and has numerous successful ongoing projects. VA s Office of Asset Enterprise Management administers the EUL Program.

In accordance with the EUL authority, VA seeks to determine if there are interested developers that can redevelop Buildings 1 and 62 and/or Buildings 10 and 69.

Interested parties may submit an EI for Building 62 for providing independent living for at risk senior and disabled Veterans and their families.  In addition Building 
1 is available for ancillary use for building 62, to provide support functions (e.g., Administrative offices, Community Room, etc.).    

Interested parties may also submit an EI for Building 69 for providing supportive housing for homeless Veterans, and/or Veterans at risk of homelessness.  In addition, Building 10 is available for ancillary use for Building 69, to provide support functions (e.g., Administrative Offices, Community Room, etc.).  

With respect to this REI, SDVOSB and VOSB set-asides apply.  If two or more VOSBs or SDVOSBs will submit offers and the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price, then any resulting procurement shall be set aside for SDVOSB s or VOSB s, in accordance with the contracting order of priority set forth in VAAR 819.7004.  For purposes of this VA-specific rule, SDVOSBs or VOSBs must meet the eligibility requirements in 38 U.S.C. 8127(e)-(f), VAAR subpart 819.7003, and be listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages ( VIP ) database, at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov .  The site database lists businesses that the VA Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE) has determined eligible for the Veterans First Contracting Program. 

The objectives of this development opportunity include:
Redevelop Buildings 1 and 62 to create safe, affordable, permanent housing for Veterans and their families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness;

Redevelop Buildings 10 and 69 to create safe, affordable, permanent housing for senior/disabled Veterans at risk of homelessness;

Provide the resident Veterans with ancillary, onsite supportive services;

Develop housing models intended to enable Veterans to achieve self-sufficiency and independent living;

The selected developers must work with the Alabama Historic Commission and the National Historic Preservation Act on the potential reuse of buildings 1, 10, 62, and 69 to retain the historic character of the Tuskegee campus;     

The selected developers shall take over ongoing VA operating costs associated with the upkeep of these vacant and/or underutilized assets; and

Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA )

<SUBJECT>VSPR Warehouse Rental
<SOLNBR>Req890504
<RESPDATE>010118
<CONTACT>Kim Yen Nguyen Tu, Contracting Specialist, Phone 6123363602, Email kimyen.n.tu@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS), Puerto Rico (PR) is awarding a sole source PO for warehouse rental. VSPR employees routinely need to move heavy equipment and supplies. VSPR requires a storage facility to house and carry&nbsp;the necessary materials/equipment for the support of any outbreak tasking and/or FEMA related tasks necessary to fulfill the duties of VSPR with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
<p>Please see Sole Source Justification below:</p>
<p>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING<br />ACTIVITY:<br />Requesting Agency:<br />USDA APHIS APHIS VS SPRS<br />654 Munoz Rivera Ave<br />Suite 700<br />Hato Rey, PR 00918</p>
<p>Contracting Activity:<br />USDA, APHIS, MRPBS, ASD<br />Minneapolis Procurement Branch<br />Butler Square, Fifth Floor<br />100 North 6th Street<br />Minneapolis, MN 55403</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:<br />Monthly rental of 800 sq. ft. warehouse space in Puerto Rico or equipment storage.</p>
<p>3. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED<br />VALUE OF THE ACQUISITION INCLUSIVE OF OPTIONS):<br />800 square feet of Warehouse Number Two (2) property of JV Mechanical Contractors, Inc., located in State Road 183, Km. 7.7, Hato Ward, Del Valle Industrial Park, San Lorenzo, P.R. Monthly rental including water and electrical power facilities. Indoor warehouse with security fence around warehouse parameters.<br />Base year of 10 months and with four 6 month option years.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUATORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITIONS:<br />The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 1901(e)(2). FAR 13.501(a) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES<br />USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:<br />VSPR has a need for a facility that will be able to store VS field equipment to uphold VS field operations. We are talking about cattle chutes, trailers, pumps, and panels. This equipment has been stored in field employees' current facilities but the places are no longer secure. After Hurricane Maria, equipment were stolen. The entire island of PR was devastated with two back to back hurricanes in September 2017 and the island is still only operating with 15% power and water. With majority of businesses still not open and operational as of yet this company is the only company that can provide the needs of VSPR which include: Space large enough for all the field equipment, outside fenced area, security cameras onsite.</p>
<p>VSPR have asked for a suitable place in the new lease for both office space and storage space, but that might take longer considering that we have been trying to negotiate a new lease since 2008 and nothing has been finalized. Therefore including option years will allow for extended use of the warehouse if a new lease is not yet finalized.</p>
<p>6. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS, OR WILL BE, PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 5.2, AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES:<br />Program looked online and around the area of their office for storage space. They only found one business who is operational and still able to provide outside fenced area around the warehouse building. JV Mechanical Contractor was the only one who offered a quote for storage space. The sole source vendor is also registered in SAM.</p>
<p>7. A DETERMINATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE, AND THE BASIS FORTHAT DETERMINATION:<br />It is determined that the monthly rate for the 800 sq. ft. is considered fair and reasonable based on market research done online for other storage units in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (FAR PART 10) AND THE RESULTS, OR AN EXPLANATION OF THE REASON<br />MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT PERFORMED:<br />See answer from 6</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION - FAR 6.303-2(a)(9):<br />NA</p>
<p>10. A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITON:<br />JV Mechanical Contractors Inc.</p>
<p>This justification has been certified by Assistant Director, Dr. Fred Soltero, of SPRS, VS Puerto Rico.</p>

<DESC>This is a notification that a modification will be issued to add sole source NSNs to the Northrop Grumman Corporate Contract subsumable contract, SPE4AX15D9408, established under SPM4AX09D9403 for Cage 76823. This letter solicitation is being solicited on an unrestricted basis. It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if any non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, Procurement Note C04 and adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is technically acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites will provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price.

<DESC>This notice is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2 requiring the dissemination of information on proposed contract actions. This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source extension. The statutory authority for this sole-source procurement is 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost or unacceptable delays.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. <br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) requires that the ITEMS EM/CSS contract HM0476-16-C-0034 provide operations and sustainment of enterprise management and cyber security services to DIA (38,700 users), the White House (500 users) and the Coast Guard (500 users) on the IC DTE Phase 1 TS/SCI desktop environment. The following IC DTE Phase 1 enterprise management and cyber security services are included under this contract action: event monitoring of servers and applications, end point security via host based security system (HBSS), vulnerability management, and auditing of the infrastructure deployed at data centers worldwide.</p>
<p>ManTech was awarded the ITEMS EM/CSS contract through a full and open competition to provide enterprise management and cyber security service for NGA users on all security domains including IC DTE Phase 1 TS/SCI domain. As a result of this award, ManTech is currently providing operations and sustainment of enterprise management infrastructure software applications (i.e. tools) that perform monitoring, end point security, vulnerability management and auditing of virtual servers or physical devices at data centers worldwide for NGA users. These same tools also provide services to DIA, the White House and the Coast Guard users for IC DTE Phase 1; therefore, ManTech is the only responsible source to provide these identical services to additional users.</p>
<p>The Government awarded the EM/CSS contract on 12 August 2016 to ManTech. The current contractor, ManTech, is qualified to perform under this contract and has in place all of the necessary resources to continue the performance of the Government's requirements in a satisfactory manner. The current contract expires on 31 October 2021.</p>
<p>NGA intends to award a sole source, firm fixed-price contract to ManTech, Fairfax, Virginia for Option Year 1 through Option Year 5 for the following service areas: service area 4, EM Engineering and Operations &amp; Sustainment, service area 8, Enterprise Tool Support, and service area 9, Cyber Engineering and Operation &amp; Sustainment.</p>
<p>While it would be technically possible for other companies to provide the required services, this could only be achieved by expending considerable resources and time. ManTech has already established the organization in order to provide these services without any transition or break in service. As a result of the discussion herein, the Government believes that only ManTech is capable of meeting the objectives of the Enterprise Management/Cyber Security Services at a reasonable price with minimal reductions in operational coverage.</p>
<p>The point of contact for this action is Contracting Officer (CO) Doris (Dee) Collier. Please contact Ms. Collier with responses or questions regarding this requirement at Doris.A.Collier@nga.mil.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent
<p>The Office of Acquisition and Agreement Management (OAAM), of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the NIST Laboratories, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Tenzi of Fovaros, HUNGARY, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 for the procurement of three identical tristimulus colorimeters.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) at NIST intends to procure the required tristimulus colorimeters under a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Commercial Items (FAR Parts 12 and 13).<br /><br />The NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) has a need for three identical tristimulus colorimeters for an existing custom tristimulus colorimeter system to realize the NIST detector-based color scale and the required spectral responsivity match to the CIE standard color matching functions. This supports calibration services and will be applied at the US Navy for the same applications.</p>
<p>Only Tenzi tristimulus colorimeters are 100 percent compatible with respect to the current tristimulus colorimeters system.</p>
<p>To develop proper functionality, the new tristimulus colorimeters are required and need to be compatible with the existing tristimulus colorimeter, which use proprietary information. During previous fabrications of NIST developed devices TENZI made the fabrication-level design after the NIST made preliminary design. The fabrication design is the proprietary of TENZI; the meter standards were fabricated by TENZI, calibrated by NIST, and applied by the U.S. Military (Air Force and Army).</p>
<p>For functionality and compatibility requirements, and to ensure the detector-based color scale and the required spectral responsivity match to the CIE standard color matching functions are not compromised, the new tristimulus colorimeters must be obtained from Tenzi. <br /><br />Only Tenzi has the unique capabilities of providing the identical types of tristimulus colorimeters as required to ensure full compatibility and functionality for detector-based color scale and the required spectral responsivity match to the CIE standard color matching functions. <br /><br />Tenzi is the sole source provider for the required system and is the only vendor able to provide the tristimulus colorimeters that meet the Government's minimum requirements which makes them uniquely qualified.  <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 334516, with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by December 28, 2017 at 11 am Eastern Standard Time (EST) will be considered by the Government.</p>

<p><br />DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE JOINT PROGRAM COMMITTEE 1, <br />MEDICAL SIMULATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCES RESEARCH PROGRAM, <br />MEDICAL SIMULATION STEERING COMMITTEE</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT OF A PROLONGED FIELD CARE TRAINING MODULE THAT INCORPORATES MODELING AND SIMULATION FOR USE IN MILITARY MEDICAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING</p>
<p><br />The Department of Defense (DoD), Joint Program Committee 1 (JPC-1), Medical Simulation portfolio is requesting research and development to develop a prolonged field care training (PFCT) system for use in military medical education and training.  The training system to be developed will incorporate a modeling and simulation system for medical treatment that extends beyond initial trauma care.</p>
<p>PFCT: No Evacuation, Now What (NENW) is a line of research that supports the anticipated Point of Injury Training System (POINTS) of Systems Program under the JPC-1/Medical Simulation and Information Sciences (MSIS) Medical Simulation portfolio.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFP is to select an organization to research and develop a flexible, modular, Point of Demand, modeling and simulation prototype system for use in military medical education and training for care in the field that extends beyond initial trauma care.  This approach includes medical care applied beyond doctrinal planning timelines and is not limited to battle injury training.</p>
<p>The proposed modeling and simulation system should remove the notion that rapid evacuation is available and there should be a rebalancing of the focus from initial skills (i.e., immediately stop the bleeding, establish an expedient airway, immediately correct pneumothoraxes) to sustainment skills (i.e., revise the tourniquet, provide oxygen carrying volume replacement, avoid hypothermia, convert airway and field expedient needle decompression to something more stable/sustainable, address nonsurgical injuries).</p>
<p>Please review the full package and submit any questions, comments, packages, documents, etc. to both points of contact listed.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Addenda: <br />1. Basis for Award</p>
<p>The Government's selection for Purchase Order awardee will be made on the basis of the lowest priced quote meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. The Purchase Order will be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with the General Standards for contractor responsibility at FAR 9.104-1, and whose proposal conforms to all of the solicitation's requirements (including stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is assessed, based on the evaluation factors below, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable. <br />2.0 Evaluation Factors &amp; Evaluation Approach<br />All proposals will be evaluated in a fair and consistent manner. All proposals will be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the lowest priced proposal that meets the acceptability standards for non-cost factors will be awarded the Purchase Order. <br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low priced when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.<br />The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the Purchase Order without discussions with the offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306). However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p><br />Factor 1 - Technical</p>
<p>The proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria established in this solicitation as follows.</p>
<p>In order to achieve an Acceptable rating in the Technical factor, the offeror's proposal must clearly meet the following minimum requirements: <br />Technical Approach: The offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements as defined in the Statement of Work to include:</p>
<p>I. The contractor shall show experience with the design and manufacture of custom high-quality wood/glass furniture by providing examples of recent work with their proposal in the form of pictures/drawings/etc.</p>
<p>ii. Understanding of the relationship between the build requirements and the design intent.</p>
<p>iii. Understanding the Requirements - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear and complete understanding of all requirements involved including capabilities, knowledge and expertise in the requested services and meeting the requirements presented by the PWS.</p>
<p>iv. Feasibility of Approach - The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the PWS requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. The evaluation will also consider the realism of the allocated hours, labor categories and price being proposed in the offeror's response to the PWS.</p>
<p><br />ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />UNACCEPTABLE: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price<br />1. The Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the price proposed on each Line Item. This Total Evaluated Price will then be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with price analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1(b). Price will not be given a rating. <br />2. An offeror must propose on all Line Items to be considered for award <br />3. Adequate competition is anticipated for this Purchase Order. However, in the event that only one offer is received, the Government reserves the right to perform a cost analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(c). Therefore, in instances when only one offer is received the contracting officer may require cost or pricing data, but such cost or pricing data is not required to be certified by the offeror. Cost or Pricing Data or Other than certified cost or pricing data shall be provided upon request IAW FAR 15.403. This information will be evaluated for magnitude and reasonableness and may be adjusted from a technical and cost perspective using cost analysis to determine the most probable cost to the Government. Offerors shall utilize a Microsoft Excel file format with formulas intact when submitting their Price/Cost quote (FAR 15.403-5(b)(1)).<br />4. Price/Cost Inconsistencies: A proposal is presumed to represent an offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. Each initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms for award for this Purchase Order. Any inconsistencies in performance or price should be explained in the proposal. Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of work required and its financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure. (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing technical assistance and services as described in the attached solicitation.
<p>USAID/Southern Africa intends to award a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion type contract for a five (5) year period from the date of award with an estimated cost in the range of $32 million to $37 million to implement the Resilient Waters Activity. This procurement will be conducted through full and open competition, for which the procedures for "contracting by negotiation, trade-off process" as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") Part 15 will govern.</p>
<p>The goal of the Resilient Waters activity is to build more resilient and water secure Southern African communities and ecosystems through improved management of transboundary natural resources and increased access to safe drinking water and sanitation services. Resilient Waters will incorporate USAID's continuous learning and adaptive management approach, which emphasizes the generation and sharing of knowledge and subsequent use of that knowledge to inform decisions, adapt ongoing activities and improve the design of future programs.<br /><br />This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal in response hereto. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.<br /><br />USAID appreciates the time and effort put into preparing proposals in response to this solicitation.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair/overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair/overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. Solicitation number 70Z03818QL0000027 is issued as a notice of intent to award to a capable repair vendor. It is anticipated that a competitive Purchase Order shall be awarded as a result of this notice. It is the Governments belief, that only a previously established Capable Repair Vendor in possession of the required OEM Data has the required proprietary technical and engineering data to successfully provide these repair services. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within (3) calendar days from this notice posting. The information submitted must include a letter from the OEM verifying the Offeror is an authorized service distributor and verifying the OEM will supply only genuine OEM parts. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96.

Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the repair or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists. Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their service data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS Engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 488190.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

In order for a company to be considered a SDVOSB or VOSB the company must be listed in https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/.  Unverified SDVOSBs or VOSBs are considered non-responsive and price quotations will not be evaluated. The award will be set aside for veteran-owned small businesses if the contracting officer received two or more offers/quotes from verified SDVOSBs or VOSBs at fair and reasonable prices that offer best value to the Government.  Offerors shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award.  Registration information is located at www.sam.gov.  Award will be made to the responsive/responsible offeror who provides the technically acceptable product at the lowest price.

<p>52.212-2 Addenda: <br />1. Basis for Award</p>
<p>The Government's selection for Purchase Order awardee will be made on the basis of the lowest priced quote meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. The Purchase Order will be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with the General Standards for contractor responsibility at FAR 9.104-1, and whose proposal conforms to all of the solicitation's requirements (including stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is assessed, based on the evaluation factors below, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable. <br />2.0 Evaluation Factors &amp; Evaluation Approach<br />All proposals will be evaluated in a fair and consistent manner. All proposals will be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the lowest priced proposal that meets the acceptability standards for non-cost factors will be awarded the Purchase Order. <br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low priced when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.<br />The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the Purchase Order without discussions with the offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306). However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p><br />Factor 1 - Technical</p>
<p>The proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria established in this solicitation as follows.</p>
<p>In order to achieve an Acceptable rating in the Technical factor, the offeror's proposal must clearly meet the following minimum requirements: <br />Technical Approach: The offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements as defined in the Statement of Work to include:</p>
<p>I. The contractor shall show experience with the design and manufacture of custom high-quality wood/glass furniture by providing examples of recent work with their proposal in the form of pictures/drawings/etc.</p>
<p>ii. Understanding of the relationship between the build requirements and the design intent.</p>
<p>iii. Understanding the Requirements - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear and complete understanding of all requirements involved including capabilities, knowledge and expertise in the requested services and meeting the requirements presented by the PWS.</p>
<p>iv. Feasibility of Approach - The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the PWS requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. The evaluation will also consider the realism of the allocated hours, labor categories and price being proposed in the offeror's response to the PWS.</p>
<p><br />ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />UNACCEPTABLE: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price<br />1. The Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the price proposed on each Line Item. This Total Evaluated Price will then be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with price analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1(b). Price will not be given a rating. <br />2. An offeror must propose on all Line Items to be considered for award <br />3. Adequate competition is anticipated for this Purchase Order. However, in the event that only one offer is received, the Government reserves the right to perform a cost analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(c). Therefore, in instances when only one offer is received the contracting officer may require cost or pricing data, but such cost or pricing data is not required to be certified by the offeror. Cost or Pricing Data or Other than certified cost or pricing data shall be provided upon request IAW FAR 15.403. This information will be evaluated for magnitude and reasonableness and may be adjusted from a technical and cost perspective using cost analysis to determine the most probable cost to the Government. Offerors shall utilize a Microsoft Excel file format with formulas intact when submitting their Price/Cost quote (FAR 15.403-5(b)(1)).<br />4. Price/Cost Inconsistencies: A proposal is presumed to represent an offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. Each initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms for award for this Purchase Order. Any inconsistencies in performance or price should be explained in the proposal. Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of work required and its financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your
response does not contain all of the required information called out in this

as non-responsive.<BR><BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use
commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>This notice is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2 requiring the dissemination of information on proposed contract actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source modification to increase scope and not a request for competitive proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The statutory authority for this sole-source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost or unacceptable delays.</p>
<p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) requirement is to provide data center services to users from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the White House, and the Coast Guard on the Intelligence Community (IC) Desktop Environment (DTE) Phase 1 Common Operating Environment (COE) Top Secret/SCI security domain.</p>
<p>General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) was awarded the ITEMS DCS Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract on 28 August 2017 through a full and open competition with a ceiling of $663,800,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result of this award, GDIT is currently providing operations and sustainment IC DTE Phase 1 data center services on 32,079 virtual servers or physical devices for NGA users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These same 32,079 virtual servers or physical devices also provide data center services to DIA, the White House, and the Coast Guard users for IC DTE Phase 1; therefore, GDIT is the only responsible source to provide these identical services to additional users.</p>
<p>There is no feasible or economical way to technically separate a single data center service (i.e. server or physical device) to support NGA users versus DIA, the White House, and the Coast Guard users without incurring a substantial duplication of costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A single server or physical device provides functionality to all IC DTE Phase 1 users.<a name="CurrentCursorPosition"></a></p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br /><br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />_X__52.204-7 -- System for Award Management (Oct 2016)<br />(a) Definitions.
