<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>Requirement: USDA-ARS, 1691 South 2700 West, Aberdeen, Idaho 83210 has a requirement for Barley Protein Analysis (see attached Statement of Work for the complete requirement). <br />Solicitation #12020219S0004 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document, with the attached clauses and provisions, is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and will be incorporated in the awarded firm-fixed price purchase order. Interested parties should reference the solicitation documents for all terms and conditions.</p>
<p>All interested parties are responsible for monitoring this website to ensure they have the most current information (i.e. Amendments) for the solicitation. No paper solicitation will be available. Please make your quote valid until June 10, 2019.<br />Notice of Set-Aside for Small Business Concerns: This requirement is a Total Small Business Set Aside.<br />Period of Performance: Service shall be completed within 30 days from delivery of seed to service location.<br />Biobased Products: This procurement requires the use of Biobased products to the extent that such products are reasonably available, meet agency or relevant industry performance standards, and are reasonably priced. The products should first be acquired from the USDA designated products categories. All supplies and materials shall be of a type and quantity that conform to applicable Federal specifications and standards, and to the extent feasible and reasonable; include the exclusive use of biobased and recycled products according to industry standards and manufacturer's recommendations. Please visit www.biopreferred.gov for more information on the USDA Biobased Program and to reference the catalog of mandatory biobased products.<br />Quote Submission Instructions:<br />1. Read the solicitation in its entirety (including the Statement of Work document). See FAR 52.211-6.<br />2. The quote should include any other documentation deemed necessary, such as past performance references.<br />3. Quotes must be submitted by 4:30 PM Mountain Standard Time, Tuesday, May 28, 2019. Send a firm fixed priced quote by email to: Rose.Wride@ars.usda.gov or Rose Wride, Purchasing Agent, USDA-ARS, 1691 S 2700 W, Aberdeen, ID 83210.<br />4. This is a Best Value Acquisition. Award of the contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the "best value" to the Government, which may not necessarily be the quote offering the lowest price nor the highest technical advantage. In the event two or more offerors within the competitive range are considered essentially equal in terms of technical competence, the Government reserves the right to award to the offeror with the lowest realistic price. FAR 15.101-2<br />5. The Government may elect to conduct discussions with offerors whose quotes are technically acceptable (or which may be expected to be made acceptable by moderate modification) and fall within the competitive price range. The Government reserves the right, however, to award a contract based on initial offers without conducting discussions. Therefore, each quote should be submitted in the most favorable terms from a price and technical standpoint. See FAR 9.104-1.<br />6. USDA-ARS is Tax Exempt. See attached Tax Exemption Certificate: 720564834F.<br />7. GSA discounts: The USDA is requesting that schedule contractors extend additional discounts to the USDA when making responses to this solicitation. GSA contract schedule holders are able to offer one-time discounts from established Schedule contracts. Schedule contractors can give one buying member a discount without passing the discount on to the entire federal government. In essence, this provision allows the contractor to offer and the government to avail itself of spot pricing in the commercial market.<br />8. Contractor must be registered at SAM.gov (System for Award Management) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ prior to award.<br />9. The Government will evaluate prices offered for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a) - Basis for Award.<br />The clause 52.214-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items and 52.214-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to implement Statues or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.

<SOLNBR>DARPA-PS-19-01
<RESPDATE>072319
<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Contracting Officer, Email DARPA-PS-19-01@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has established the Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program within the Tactical Technology Office (TTO). The objective of the RSGS program is to create a dexterous robotic operational capability in Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) that can both provide increased resilience for the current U.S. space infrastructure and be the first concrete step toward a transformed space architecture with revolutionary capabilities. The long-term vision of the RSGS program is to enable persistent robotic servicing capabilities in GEO, beginning with the robotic servicer developed under the RSGS program and operated by a commercial entity, with the goal of achieving an enduring, reliable, cost effective GEO satellite servicing presence.
<p>This solicitation seeks Other Transaction (OT) proposals under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b for a U.S. space industry builder-owner-operator team that will partner with DARPA to jointly develop and demonstrate a robotic servicing vehicle (RSV) in GEO. DARPA expects this team to have the ability to manufacture a GEO-qualified spacecraft bus, integrate a Government-provided payload onto that bus, launch the RSV, provide ground communications across the GEO belt, and operate the vehicle commercially for many years after successful completion of DARPA-specified demonstrations on-orbit. It is anticipated that the RSV owner will benefit from revenues derived from servicing operations provided to both commercial and Government operators of GEO satellites.</p>
<p>Executive Summary Due Date: June 4, 12:00 p.m. (ET)</p>

<DESC>In 2017 FEMA awarded a contract for the design and installation of an audio-visual system in the new FEMA Region VII Regional Office. During the design process FEMA did not have on-site technical expertise to work with the contractor to ensure the design met the need of the agency. In addition, during installation FEMA again did not provide on-site technical expertise to respond to inquiries, provide direction or approve the work. Unfortunately, there were also challenges with accurate and timely information being provided to the contractor. As a result, FEMA has experienced a number of issues/challenges with the system. It is not clear whether the issues are FEMA or contractor caused.<br /><br />****Exhibits 2 AND 3 must be uploaded securely. FEMA is in the process of releasing these documents in fbo.gov as "secure documents." This announcment will be updated once the documents have been sucessfully uploaded.

<DESC>This Synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood the FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.<br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to modify Contracts N00178-14-D-3035, awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation(NGSC), located at 2340 Dulles Corner Blvd., Herndon, VA 20171 and N00178-14-D-3036, awarded to DRS Laurel Technologies, Inc., located at 246 Airport Rd., Johnston, PA 15904, both for Ship Self Defense System (SSDS), Mark 2 (Mk2) Production Hardware. The modifications are to add a Level of Effort (LOE) Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for engineering services. The anticipated award date for the services CLIN is 31 May 2019. The anticipated LOE for each contract is 8,526 hours. The estimated value of each contract is not to exceed $1.9M.

<div>required changes to Government provided Technical Data Packages (TDP's) for Class II engineering changes that affect manufacturing or fitment. As part of monthly production monitoring, each Contractor will provide a consolidated list of corrected issues. The Ordering Period for the NGSC Contract ends on 19 August 2019. The Ordering Period for the DRS Contract ends on 30 July 2019. Questions may be directed to: Theresa.ashton-moore@navy.mil.

<DESC>1. This is a sources sought announcement. This announcement is in support of market research to determine the feasibility of a competitive acquisition and to identify potential sources that can provide a COTS solution for the EEO Complaint process. <br /><br />2. The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency's (CSOSA) Office of Information Technology (OIT) requires a COTS solution for the EEO Complaint process. The system must be designed for Federal agencies where the complaint system can generate the EEOC 462 and No FEAR reports for submission to the EEOC. CSOSA is also interested in this being a SaaS or hosted product which is FEDRamp compliant. <br /><br />3. Scope of work for this requirement includes:&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; - An easy to use web-based system to track and manage EEO Cases through the entire life cycle, including the ability to record and track the complaint and personal information, contacts, claims, events, corrective actions, final closure status(es), and outcomes, as well as whom the complaint is against (person or agency team/division).<br /><br />&nbsp; - Solution that is able to capture formal, information, and mixed cases and track statuses within each of these areas, along with the ability to link cases when they go from one case type to another (e.g., informal to formal).<br /><br />&nbsp; - Solution that is able to track each stage of the informal and formal complaint process as is established by Equal&nbsp;Employment Opportunity (EEO) Regulations at&nbsp;29 CFR Part&nbsp;1614, as&nbsp;well as Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC's) Managmeent Directive 110.<br /><br />&nbsp; - Solution that has the ability to have multiple assignments so that cases are linked to both an EEO manager and EEO specialist and display or filter cases based on this assignment.<br /><br />&nbsp; - Solution that has the ability to upload supporting documents and link these back to specific case areas. <br /><br />&nbsp; - Solution should include capability for the user to run reports and do searches not only by the Complainant's name, but also by the Agency Cost Unit as well as by the Responsible Management Officials named in the formal complaint.<br /><br />4. All responsible sources who believe they have a solution to the above requirement may contact CSOSA to schedule a demonstration of the COTS solution in accordance with paragraph&nbsp;5 below.
<p>5. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of developing a competitive requirement. This sources sought does not constitute a solicitation for bids, quotes, or proposals and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response to this request.
