Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition/repair from the present source is anticipated pending configuration changes.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT<br />CHASE AIRCRAFT SERVICES<br />ELLINGTON FIELD, HOUSON, TEXAS</p>
<p>This request is for information only. This is not a request for quote/proposal and there is no solicitation package available at this time. The Texas Air National Guard, 147ATKW Ellington Field, Houston, Texas is seeking sources to provide Chase Aircraft Services for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. 147 ATKW Contracting office is conducting market research to determine the availability of businesses capable of providing Chase Aircraft Services at Ellington Field.</p>
<p>Description of Service:<br />The 147 Attack Wing is seeking Chase aircraft support for its local Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) flight operations. The concept of operations is that the Chase aircraft will provide chase support while the RPA is in the local pattern at Ellington Field (KEFD) and also while it transits to and from W147D over the Gulf of Mexico and R-3804 over Ft. Polk AAF, LA. Chase aircraft can launch from any airfield within 40 miles of Ellington Field but is required to be overhead KEFD at scheduled RPA takeoff time. After initial RPA takeoff, chase will observe RPA in the traffic pattern and accompany the RPA on transit to W147D or R-3804. Chase aircraft must be able to communicate on two separate frequencies, one internal with RPA and one for controlling/coordinating agencies. For W147D operations, chase aircraft will follow the RPA to W147D and return to base (RTB) after the RPA enters W147D. The chase aircraft and crew will be on standby until scheduled RTB time, or until notified of an early RTB. Chase aircraft will then escort the RPA back to KEFD and return to base after the RPA completes a full stop landing. For operations in R-3804, chase aircraft will follow the RPA to R-3804 and then land at Leesville City Airport. The chase aircraft and crew will be on standby until scheduled RTB time, or until notified to return prior to scheduled RTB. Upon that time, the chase aircraft will follow the RPA back to KEFD and return to base after the RPA completes a full stop landing.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment, and labor necessary to provide support for a chase plane. Contractor must be able to provide one chase aircraft for up to 10 hours per day, 5 days per week. Aircraft must be capable of cruise up to 150 knots and flight up to 15,000ft, with an endurance of at least 4.5 hours and have the ability to communicate on two separate frequencies simultaneously. Chase Aircrew will consist of one qualified pilot and one qualified chase observer providing "see and avoid" capability for RPA. Two qualified pilots are required for any night operations.</p>
<p>Qualifications:<br />Pilots of any aircraft in support of this contract shall be operated by the contractor in accordance with all applicable regulatory guidance. Certificate shall contain all the necessary endorsements to conform with the 14 CFRs.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 238220. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. The project is planned to be issued on or about August 2018 and will extend over a 9-month period.
<p>The project scope of work consists of installing a monitoring and treatment systems for the control and prevention of Legionella disease at the VAMC Brockton campus. The buildings identified for the installation of the monitoring systems are Buildings 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 23, and 62; and the water treatment system is located in Building 47. Electrical, instrumentation, and controls systems shall be installed to allow remote aggregation of data and control of flushing points and treatment system.</p>
<p>The water quality monitoring system consists of two types of monitoring system - point of entry and representative outlet for each building. The point of entry monitoring system will continuously monitor and record: pH, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), and total chlorine. The locations of these point of entry monitoring systems are generally in mechanical rooms of each building. Hydraulically remote areas, or distal points, of the hot and cold water distribution systems in each building serve as representative outlets for monitoring oxidant residual and temperature levels. The locations of these representative outlets for the cold water system are generally in employee bathrooms, break rooms, and locker rooms. For the hot water system, the locations are generally in the mechanical rooms of each building. Reagent-based total chlorine analyzers will be used for the monitoring systems due to the current water treatment system.</p>
<p>VAMC Brockton is currently treating all water supplied by the City of Brockton with a leased monochloramine booster system located in Building 47. The contract will replace the existing treatment system with a new system in Building 47 that will deliver 2.0 mg/L of total chlorine concentration at average campus flow rates. The treatment system will consist of a chemical storage tank with a level sensor, spill containment pallet, metering pumps, calibration column, pressure relieve valve, backpressure valve, chemical piping and tubing, a check valve, and injection quill.</p>
<p>To ensure accurate control of chemical dosage of the water treatment system and to allow for proper monitoring and reporting of data collected from the monitoring system, new electrical, instrumentation, and controls will be installed which will integrate with the existing Building Management System (BMS) for the campus.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classifications (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications of the firm and experience in performing the work requirements stated above.

<SUBJECT>--Wolf Taxonomy Study - Sole Source

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:alicia_weber@fws.gov">alicia_weber@fws.gov</a>
<DESC>At the request of the U.S. Congress, the Fish and Wildlife Service, Science Applications, will initiate a study through the National Academy of Sciences, a qualified independent entity, to determine whether or not animals currently classified as red wolves and Mexican gray wolves are taxonomically valid species and subspecies designations, respectively. The study shall consist of an independent analysis of existing scientific literature, including genetic research, and publication of a report on results of the analysis, including a scientific literature review. The period of performance will be completed by March 23, 2019. The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-5. In their 2018 Appropriations language Congress made it clear they wanted a nationally-recognized, highest caliber, independent, scientific organization to conduct this study. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a private, non-profit society of distinguished scholars. Established by an Act of Congress, signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, the NAS is charged with providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology and conduct other activities to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions. The National Academy of Sciences routinely conducts this type of work and is uniquely qualified with access to the best expertise to conduct this study.
All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability for this requirement by responding to this announcement. All capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
