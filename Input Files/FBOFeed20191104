EXPORT CONTROLLED DATA: This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.

U.S. contractors must submit a copy of their current approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. The form, including instructions for completing the form, is available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2220.html.

Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Prospective vendors must comply with all the requirements of the solicitation and its attachments to be considered responsive. The Government does not intend to hold discussions, but may hold discussions if it is deemed necessary. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 405-736-3273.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source, R. M. Young Company, 2801 Aero Park Drive, Traverse City, Michigan for the following repair/replacement parts for a R. M. Young Company Model 05103 Wind Monitor: 800 each Flange Bearing, P/N 05163PG; 800 each Vertical Shaft Bearing, P/N 05124VG; 5 each Main Housing & Tail Assy P/N 05172; 25 each Propeller for 453A/05103 RMY, P/N 08234; 5 each Mounting Post Assy for 453A/AQ, P/N 05121E; 20 each Propeller Shaft w/ hub, P/N 05164C; 20 each Potentiometer-10K, P/N 05134. This action is authorized by and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement is the R. M. Young Company. These repair/replacement parts are manufactured specifically for the R.M. Young Sensor. There are no other replacement/repairs parts available that maintain the calibration of the sensor required to meet the required National Fire Danger Rating Standards. A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. The estimated value of this acquisition is less than $32,000.00. No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1). The requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 334513 applies. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item 140L3720Q0002. However, they must provide convincing evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost. All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by November 19, 2019 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with R. M. Young Company for the requirement stated here. Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed in writing to Mindi Paulson at mpaulson@blm.gov.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong><br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, including organ transplantation and graft rejection. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement entitled "Nonhuman Primate MHC and KIR Allele Discovery and Typing Technology Development."<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span></strong><br />In fiscal year (FY) 2004, NIAID established the NHP MHC Gene Discovery and Typing Technology Development Program, under Part II of Request for Proposals (RFP) NIH-NIAID-DAIT-04-24, titled "Development of Immune Monitoring Reagents and MHC Typing Technologies for Non-human Primates". This program is currently supported under BAA-NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI-20150033, "NHP MHC Gene Discovery and Typing Technology Development". Two contracts were awarded in FY 2016: University of Wisconsin, Madison (HHSN272201600007C) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (HHSN272201600027C).<br /><br />NIAID-supported efforts have provided the majority of the macaque MHC gene sequences submitted to GenBank since 2004. The Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) MHC validates and annotates NHP MHC gene sequences that are submitted to GenBank. The number of MHC Class I and MHC Class II sequences validated and assigned novel allele designations by the IPD for M. fascicularis, M. mulatta, and M. nemestrina continues to expand rapidly. New genotyping and gene discovery methods are at various stages of development, including adaptation of massively parallel pyrosequencing of cDNA-PCR amplicons. Full-length MHC and KIR sequence capture have become feasible and reveal significant variation not achieved by partial gene capture techniques.<br /><br />This renewal solicitation of the NHP MHC and KIR Allele Discovery and Typing Development Program will expand upon the initial program goals to advance our knowledge of NHP MHC and KIR through the discovery and characterization of their genetic loci, alleles, and haplotypes, and frequencies; initiate discovery and characterization of NHP FcR genes, alleles and frequencies; and develop robust, high-throughput genotyping and haplotyping methods.<br /><br />This BAA is the renewal of BAA-NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI2015033. Funding under the prior BAA is NOT required for the current solicitation; all qualified offerors are invited to apply.<br /><br />It is anticipated that one or two cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a seven (7)-year period of performance beginning on or about April 1, 2021.<br /><br />NIAID estimates that the average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) is $1.0M for all contract awards made under this announcement. However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed seven (7) years.<br /><br />Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about November 20, 2019 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.<br /><br />For this solicitation, the NIAID requires proposals to be submitted online via the NIAID electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website. Submission of proposals by facsimile or e-mail is not acceptable.<br /><br />For directions on using eCPS, go to the website https://ecps.niaid.nih.gov and then click on "How to Submit."

<DESC><p>a. This is a Request for Information (RFI) notice only. This RFI is for informational and planning purposes and it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) is requesting information pertaining to Program Management Knowledge Based Services support for the F-35 Lighting II JPO and associated Air Systems.</p>
<p>b. The F-35 JPO, in conjunction with the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst, is releasing a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), Attachment 1, as part of an RFI to identify interested parties and solicit comments to improve the quality and clarity of the requirements for program management support services at the F-35 JPO. The Government's intent is to release an RFP, which will result in a single award Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of not less than five years. The Government anticipates awarding four (4) task orders (T/O) for proposal along with the IDIQ proposal. These task orders will be aligned with one or more of the requirements captured in Section 3 Performance Requirement of Attachment 1, will be awarded at the time of IDIQ award, and will consist of over 200 FTEs performing at the F-35 JPO and other sites.</p>
<p>c. The Government seeks to establish pricing on the basic IDIQ for all of the years and for all of the intended labor categories to be procured on all task orders, not just for those awarded upfront. Thus, the base IDIQ, at the time of award, will contain agreed-to pricing for all work to be performed throughout the life of the contract.</p>
<p>d. The F-35 JPO requires program management support for the Directorates, Functional, and Integrated Product Teams, which reside within the F-35 JPO. The specific tasks are captured in the Draft IDIQ PWS, Attachment 1(Section 3 and Labor Categories).</p>
<p>e. Due to the nature and dynamics of this requirement, any prime contractor submitting a proposal must be able to support up to the Top Secret level at the time their proposal is submitted to the Government in response to the RFP. This is to allow the contractor to perform on any variant of JPO security requirements upon award.</p>
<p>f. The Government will potentially hold an industry day in in early/mid-January 2020 in Arlington, VA. Please check back at this site for details on the industry day. The Government will continue to provide information, draft documents and other program updates as they become available. FedBizOpps is the information source for this effort. Industry is highly encouraged to monitor this website for future postings.</p>
<p>g. The Government intends to release the RFP via Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) January 2020.</p>

ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY INTERESTED PARTIES IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY, AND NO MONETARY COMPENSATION WILL BE PROVIDED FOR RESPONSE PREPARATION.
<p>Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information (including trade secrets) contained within their response. The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information that has not been both properly marked and clearly identified. Information marked proprietary received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations. To aid the Government in its review, please segregate proprietary information.<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program (SIOP) Program Manager of Ships (PMS 555) Program Management Office is interested in understanding if floating dry docks are a viable and cost effective alternative to graving docks for conducting docking evolutions to support maintenance of nuclear submarines of all classes at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard (PHNSY).<br />Objective - This RFI seeks to identify the procurement cost, life cycle cost (maintenance and operational), timeline for construction, lifting and handling capabilities, ballasting control systems for complex lifting and handling functions, mooring requirements, blocking requirements, and structural requirements for a floating dry dock production facility that can dock nuclear submarines at the PHNSY.<br />Current Studies- Production flow analyses are now in progress to define efficient production processes for submarine availabilities. The concept is to perform 80% of the tasks in a production facility and reduce the excessive workforce movement. The floating dry dock production facility will provide management offices, workforce comfort areas, shop areas, crane service and supporting services.<br />Floating Dry Dock Production Facility Example: One concept is a floating dry dock about 500ft long and 250 feet beam. The dock area would have 150ft open area with 50 foot wide wing walls to provide the necessary space for offices, shops, comfort areas, storage and support. Crane service will be with two 25-50 ton gantry or bridge cranes. Construction would be modular in 125x250ft sections.<br />Additionally, the RFI seeks to identify necessary utility requirements for successful docking evolutions of the ship classes noted above and whether U.S. based construction/shipbuilding companies are capable of constructing such floating dry docks.<br />SUBMISSION DETAILS:</p>
<p>PMS 555 is requesting companies to provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Procurement cost based on a design for VIRGINIA Class Block V with VPM.<br />&bull; Minimum Floating Dry Dock length = 650 feet<br />&bull; Minimum Floating Dry Dock Deck width (not including wing wall) = 75 feet<br />&bull; Minimum floor loading capability = 35 LT/ft</p>
<p>2. Concept for dry dock production facility contained within wing walls with shop space capable of servicing 80% of the workload and concept for production facility at head of the mooring location to include a deployable service ramp to deck plate of floating dry dock capable at a minimum of bow dome removal.</p>
<p>3. Life cycle cost for maintenance and operation.</p>
<p>4. Notional construction and delivery timeline, to include acceptance and Military Standard (MILSTD) MIL-STD-1625(D) certification testing. Assume ABS standards for floating dry docks</p>
<p>5. Construction will be in the US following laws regarding the SCN account. Any subsidiary status of a foreign-based entity must also be revealed.</p>
<p>6. Lifting and handling design and capability, along with ballasting system to accommodate complex and heavy lifts.</p>
<p>7. Calculations and/or requirements for mooring, structural integrity, blocking, and utilities necessary to support docking evolutions for each type of floating dry dock. Additionally, utility support capabilities for onboard submarine shall be provided.</p>
<p>8. Required IT infrastructure to support floating dry dock operations and onboard submarine maintenance.</p>
<p>9. Information necessary to design and build this facility.<br />Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competitive solicitation, if one is issued. If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced later via FBO, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this RFI.<br />There is no page limit to this response. A cover letter is required and shall contain the following information:<br />&bull; Association or Business name, address, CAGE code, and Point of Contact, including name, phone number and email address responsible for submission.<br />&bull; Company size (Small or Large), in accordance with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 336611, size standard 1,250 employees.<br />&bull; Your company's Master Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) and/or Agreement for Boat Repair (ABR) number</p>

<DESC>This is a PRE-SOLICITATION notice. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Network Contract Office (NCO) 22-G intends to award a non-personnel services contract to provide care, treatment, and rehabilitative services, including case management services; and therapeutic transitional housing assistance for the Health Care for Homeless Veterans Programs (HCHV).

The central goal of the HCHV program is to reduce homelessness among Veterans by conducting outreach to those who are the most vulnerable and who are not currently receiving VA services, and then engaging them in treatment and rehabilitation as well as in other VA programs and non-VA community programs that provide prevention and support services.

The HCHV program was developed from the original Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill (HCMI) Program, a six month pilot project, established February 12, 1987.

In recent years, VA s effort to eliminate Veteran homelessness has led to the development of a range of additional programs and initiatives implemented by VHA Central Office, Office of Clinical Operations, and Homeless Programs Office. Additionally, programs such as Department of Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) have been expanded to include programmatic components that address the gaps in services for homeless Veterans.  Because HCHV programs typically are the first to make contact with homeless Veterans, they frequently serve as the entry point for these services and thus, provide VA a way to outreach, assist, and offer homeless Veterans an  Open Door  to the continuum of VA services.

In addition to this core mission, HCHV functions as a mechanism to contract with providers for community-based residential treatment for homeless Veterans.

Because the least disruptive and most economically efficient way to end homelessness is to prevent its occurrence, VA has expanded its homeless initiatives to include support services aimed at the prevention of homelessness.  Unlike VA s traditional homeless programs, which focus on treatment and rehabilitation of the individual Veteran, prevention services address those Veterans and their families who are at immediate risk for becoming homeless or who have recently become homeless.  This group includes Veterans recently released from prison or who are otherwise involved with the criminal justice system.  HCHV programs are well positioned to assist these Veterans in accessing the appropriate level of services through other VA programs and non-VA community programs.

The HCHV program is vital for providing a gateway to VA and community-based supportive services for eligible Veterans who are homeless.  This includes ensuring that chronically homeless Veterans and/or those with serious mental health diagnoses can be placed in community-based programs that provide quality housing and services that meet the needs of these special populations.

<DESC>1.	Notice:  <br />This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.  The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine if responsible sources exist to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total or partial Small Business Set-Aside.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB),  8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone), or other than small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 334511, size standard 1,250 employees.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.
<p>Respondents should submit a capabilities package that is brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrates an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>This effort's acquisition strategy has not yet been determined.  Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be satisfied via full and open competition, a small business set-aside, or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>Note, if there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.  If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Note, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will still be considered.  Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>2.	Program Information:</p>
<p>The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking information from industry in support of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS)-2C program.  Solicitation issuance is anticipated in the FY22 time period.</p>
<p>The USAF is pursuing a vision to more rapidly address airborne ISR warfighter needs. This requires the ability to quickly develop capabilities for integration into operations. As there are constantly new challenges emerging to the USAF and the DoD, the pursuit of adaptability is key.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought aims to specifically address the future acquisition of the ASARS-2C sensor processor. ASARS-2C is the next iteration of the synthetic aperture radar. The vision of the program is to utilize selected open standards to streamline future hardware upgrades and enable third party mode development.</p>
<p>3.	Technical Information Requested:</p>
<p>The Government intends to perform a two round Sources Sought Synopsis. Round one will include two topics that are outlined below.  Round two, if pursued, will be via invitation only following evaluation of contractor qualifications received in round one, Topic 1. Prospective Offerors responding to Topic 1 should do so with the intent to respond to both rounds. It is not guaranteed that Offerors providing information on Topic 1 will be selected to provide additional information in round two.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis solicits feedback from industry regarding two topics. Topic 1 seeks to identify potential sources for Common Open Architecture Radar Programs standard (COARPs) compliant ASARS Common Backend Processor hardware.  Topic 2 seeks to identify vendors with radar processing software development experience, preferably using COARPs version 2.0 mode software architecture. Further description of the topics and information to be provided is detailed below.</p>
<p>Topic 1: Provide experience and background information demonstrating your experience developing processing hardware implementing the COARPs version 2.0 design criteria. The radar processing hardware is defined as the hardware architecture after the digitization of RF channels for use in radar products. A mixture of general purpose processors (GPPs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and graphical processing units (GPUs) is acceptable in the CBP design.</p>
<p>Topic 2:  Provide experience and background information sufficient to demonstrate the ability to develop radar algorithms. Experience producing modes while adhering to COARPs design guidelines is preferred.  Additionally, a COARPs compliant design will allow third-party vendors to develop and supply radar modes. State your company's mode development experience with prior Air Force or DoD programs, application(s) that has/have been developed on previous programs, and any other supporting documentation for the application.</p>
<p>4.	Responses:</p>
<p>Responses are to be limited to a Title Page (1 page) followed by Technical Details (no more than 3 pages), and small business information (1 page). Overall response is not to exceed 5 pages.&nbsp; Technical details shall include past performance to include contract numbers, values, and customer information. Each vendor may provide individual responses to each topic, but may not respond multiple times to a single topic. The response may be a doc or pdf file. Vendors intending to submit classified responses should contact the government at least 10 days prior to submitting a response to obtain delivery instructions.  Standard formatting is requested (i.e 1 inch margins, 12 point font in Times New Roman, single or double spaced). Responses deviating from length or formatting requirements may not be reviewed.&nbsp; Unclassified responses are to be submitted via email to the Government POCs identified below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.	Government POCs:</p>
<p>Government POCs for this Sources Sought are: Robert (Mike) Hoelzel, AFLCMC/WINK, (937) 656-4208, Robert.Hoelzel.1@usl.af.mil, and Joseph Plessinger, AFLCMC/WINK, (937) 904-4058, joseph.plessinger@us.af.mil.</p>

Notice
This advertisement is a notice of a potential opportunity.  This advertisement is not a solicitation for offers, nor is it a request for proposals.  The purpose of this advertisement is to identify potential sources and suitable locations, and is not intended to pre-qualify or disqualify any potential offers.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this advertisement.  The Government cannot provide any warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy, reliability or completeness of contents of the furnished information found within this advertisement; Government is under no responsibility to respond to and is unable to answer any inquiries regarding this advertisement.  This notice is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 19.14 and DVA Acquisition Regulation 819.70. 

Description
The DVA (U.S. Government) currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Yakima, Washington, that will be expiring in November 2019.  The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. The continuity of services must be maintained to meet the DVA s mission of serving Veterans.

The DVA seeks information from Potential Offerors who are capable of successfully performing a lease contract, including design and construction of the facility on a DVA pre-approved site, as well as all maintenance and operation requirements for the duration of the lease term.  More information on DVA s requirements can be found on its Technical Information Library: http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/. 

DVA seeks to lease an estimated 7,500 American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) (ABOA) square feet of space for use as a Community Based Outreach Clinic, or CBOC, in the delineated area (shown below) within the greater Yakima, WA area.  DVA will only consider leased space located in an existing building.

ABOA Square Feet   SF, (also known as useable) is generally defined as the space remaining once common areas, lessor areas, and non-programmatic areas required by code are deducted from the rentable square feet (RSF) of the facility.  ABOA does not include areas such as stairs, elevators, mechanical and utility rooms, ducts, shafts, vestibules, public corridors, and public toilets required by local code.  A detailed definition will be provided by DVA, should a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) be issued for this project.

Beneficial Occupancy: December 2019

<DESC><strong>Type of Notice: </strong>
<p>This is a Small Businesses Sources Sought notice (SBSS).  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business;  HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />The NAICS code for this project is 541990. The small business size standard is $15M.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI) carries out studies to quantify second cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation exposures in pediatric cancer patients.  The Branch has a specific interest in the risk of second tumors following proton therapy in children, because concern has been raised about whole-body scatter doses from neutrons, brain necrosis and other late effects including second tumors.</p>
<p>Pediatric radiation oncology is undergoing rapid changes due to the widespread introduction of proton therapy.  By reducing high-dose exposure to nearby normal tissue protons should reduce a wide-range of serious adverse-effects, such as second cancers.  To date, no studies have directly evaluated the potential benefits or risks of protons for children, and some case series have raised concerns about some serious unanticipated side-effects, such as brain necrosis.  There is widespread agreement amongst the clinical and scientific community that large-scale collaborative efforts are urgently required to address these questions.  NCI plans to create the first prospective cohort study by expanding the US Pediatric Proton Consortium Registry (PPCR) to add photon therapy centers and systematic follow-up.  NCI's primary aim will be to add a comparison group of photon patients in order to quantify the subsequent cancer risks after proton compared to photon therapy. Subsequent cancers are one of the most common and serious adverse-effects of pediatric radiotherapy. The PPCR is the most practical place to start in the US, because it has been collecting data from the US proton centers for the past 7 years and has the infrastructure and knowledge in place for the study. This Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of NCI.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this acquisition is to obtain data on a group of photon-treated pediatric cancer patients to serve as a comparison group to an existing cohort of proton-treated pediatric patients. The objectives are to obtain and monitor data collection by individual hospital centers where pediatric cancer patients continue to be treated with photons in order to form a comparison cohort; provide access to the PPCR online data platforms (REDCap and MIM) for data collection and storage; and provide assistance to individual centers to collect required radiotherapy and imaging data to be comparable to the proton data in the PPCR.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall have experience managing a pediatric proton consortium registry including collecting clinical data from pediatric cancer patients treated with protons from multiple treatment centers and maintaining a database of clinical and treatment data.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>1.	  Obtain and monitor data acquisition for pediatric cancer patients treated at participating hospital centers that treat pediatric cancer patients with photons. This shall include travel to study sites to orient the participating study sites to the data requirements for the study that result in the collection of medical and radiotherapy treatment data. Follow-up travel to the participating centers will be on as needed basis to monitor study progress. NCI estimates up to ten trips will be needed.</p>
<p>2.	Assign study participant IDs to all pediatric cancer photon-treated patients to facilitate creation of a cohort of photon-treated patients.</p>
<p>3.	Monitor study subject enrollment and data collection progress through regular communication and occasional site visits with participating hospital centers.</p>
<p>4.	Maintain the data acquisition and storage system in REDCaP, a secure web-based data collection platform with online survey capabilities, to house medical record data for a multi-center consortium registry for pediatric patients treated with protons.</p>
<p>5.	Maintain a data storage system for radiotherapy plans and dose data in MIMS.</p>
<p>6.	Provide access for the participating centers to enter data for photon patients into the PPCR REDCap data management system.</p>
<p>7.	Monitor data regularly in REDCap for completeness across all participating sites.  Provide participating sites with monthly reports identifying missing data fields that highlight the critical data fields.</p>
<p>8.	Visit the study centers as needed to review archived and current radiotherapy plans. The contractor shall work closely with the participating centers, to collect final radiotherapy plans at participating hospital sites, including unarchiving older radiotherapy plans, and upload these plans into MIM for online central storage.</p>
<p>9.	Monitor data regularly in MIM for completeness across all participating sites.  Provide participating sites with monthly reports identifying missing treatment plans and other relevant radiation treatment data.</p>
<p><strong><br />Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of options, for this proposed acquisition is May 2020 - May 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought:</strong></p>
<p>Small businesses possessing experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the aforementioned requirements and level of effort are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform the required services.  Information furnished must not exceed 20 pages (12-point font minimum), including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.; and should include an outline of previous or similar projects performed.  All responses must include an indication of current certified small business status, and clearly marked on the first page of the capability statement, as well as the eligible small business concern's name, point of contact, address, and DUNS number.</p>

In regards to security screening and public safety, sensitive, accurate and reliable methods for detecting and identifying threats in the field continue to be a necessity for DoD entities and other federal government agencies. Entry Control Points (ECPs) are often the first step in the physical security of US interests around the world. One technology that is being used in security screening to detect concealed threats and contraband is backscatter X-ray imaging. Backscatter X-ray imaging systems are able to see through materials like steel, rubber, aluminum, and drywall, while detecting low density organics; however, these systems are often large, expensive, and require significant site preparation, presenting security screening and rapid system deployment challenges and limitations. In response to these limitations, companies have developed miniature, handheld backscatter X-ray imaging devices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Miniaturizing backscatter X-ray devices provides more portability for searches and enhances the capability of accelerated system deployment, facilitating the likelihood to conduct faster and more cost-effective security screening activities.</span></p>

DoD entities, other federal government and law enforcement agencies are particularly interested in backscatter X-ray capability for field expedient triage.</span></p>

<DESC>A market survey is being conducted to determine if there are a reasonable number of interested small business concerns to set this future project aside for them. If your firm is a Small Business, certified HUBZone, 8A, Woman-Owned Small Business or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business and you are interested in this project please respond appropriately. The proposed project is a design, bid, build requirement. The proposed project description is:
<p>Construct three (3) entry overhangs extending over three separate entrance areas of DFAS, Building 21. Among these three entrances, two larger entrances are very similar in plan, elevation, and section.

The Department of Veterans Affairs is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify firms having an interest in and the resources to support a requirement for ambulance transportation services for the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, WI (VAMC). The result of this market research may contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 621910   Ambulance Services. 
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  
Tentative requirements:  
Provide ambulance services for veteran patients for VAMC.  Services required include non-emergency Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS), and Critical Care Transport (CCT) services.  The place of performance is variable; ambulance services may be required at VAMC and counties in southeastern and central Wisconsin and surrounding areas, with transportation requirements occasionally extending to other VA facility locations in Wisconsin and Illinois.  Estimated annual mileage may exceed 25,000 miles:
Service Type
Est. Annual Quantity 
BLS Non-emergency trips 
700
ALS Non-emergency trips
40
CCT trips
20

If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, web site address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, vehicle fleet size, and documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. 
The government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated.
Based on the responses to this synopsis and other market research, this requirement may be set-aside for veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs or VOSBs), small businesses or procured through full and open competition.  



Limitations on Subcontracting 
13 CFR 125.6 will apply to any procurement set-aside for veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs or VOSBs) or small businesses.  13 CFR 125.6 states:
(a) General. In order to be awarded a full or partial small business set-aside contract with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101)  in paragraph (a) introductory text; and an 8(a) contract, an SDVO SBC contract, a HUBZone contract, a WOSB or EDWOSB contract pursuant to part 127 of this chapter, a small business concern must agree that:
(1) In the case of a contract for services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not similarly situated. Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 50% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded.
Before any large or small business can be awarded a federal contract, a contracting officer (CO) must affirmatively determine that the firm is responsible to perform the specific contract it is otherwise in line to receive.  If an apparent small business successful offeror is denied a contract award because it lacks certain elements of responsibility, the CO will refer the matter to the Small Business Administration.  Once a CO s referral is received by the SBA s area office, the SBA will then inform the small business of the CO s determination and offer it the opportunity to apply to the SBA for a Certificate of Competency   by a specific date. Burden of proof is on the small business to demonstrate that it meets specific COC eligibility criteria.
After award, if a CO or other VA officials determine a review of limitations on subcontracting compliance is warranted based upon reasonable information of possible noncompliance, a request for review will be submitted to VA s Subcontracting Compliance Review Program.  
Submission Instructions: Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform the above-listed services are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by 4:00 PM local time on November 12, 2019. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to maureen.falaschi@va.gov. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

Non-VA Temporary Lodging Facility 
For Veterans in Substance Use Disorder Outpatient Programs at 
Grand Junction VA Medical Center



OVERVIEW

The VA Western Colorado Healthcare System (WCHCS) requires a contractor to provide temporary lodging for eligible Veterans involved in outpatient treatment with the facility s Addiction Disorder Services (ADS) program. The goal of the ADS program is to provide Veterans with a continuum of care when engaged in outpatient treatment for substance use disorders, and stable, sober housing for homeless Veterans is recognized as being an essential component of this program.

BACKGROUND

Since 1973, the treatment of Substance Use Disorders (SUD) through VA Programs has been an integral part of the Office of Mental Health Services (OMHS). SUD Programs are authorized to utilize an integrated continuum of care, and outpatient, residential, and inpatient care must be available to all eligible Veterans with SUD in accordance with existing authority at Title 38 United States Code (U.S.C.) 1720A and Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 17.38 and 17.80 through 17.83. 

The VA offers a comprehensive continuum of care for SUD from outpatient services to residential and inpatient care. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. (1720A(d)(1)), SUD specialty treatment services are to be located in every VA medical facility. Facilities must make services for SUD available to Veterans who need them, and they must be provided by appropriate facility staff, by telemental health, by referral to other VA facilities, or by sharing agreements, contracts, or non-VA fee basis care to the extent that the Veteran is eligible. 

Access to care is a high priority in the VHA.  The VA is committed to providing timely and appropriate access to high-quality, integrated, comprehensive, and cost-effective continuum of care to eligible Veterans with substance use disorders.  (VHA Handbook 1160.04, section 8.a.) While WCHCS does provide detoxification and outpatient SUD treatment services, this medical center does not have a residential SUD program which is necessary to provide all levels of care which may be indicated for SUD clients. Further, there are no VA residential SUD programs in the State of Colorado. There are only three VA residential SUD programs in VISN 19, one in Utah and two in Wyoming. There are numerous barriers to Veterans who might benefit from out-of-state residential SUD programs. For example, many SUD clients do not have transportation and are not eligible for transportation benefits. Additionally, many SUD clients have legal issues which prohibit them from leaving the State of Colorado. 

While WCHCS does not have a residential SUD program, an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) for SUD is viewed as an alternative to residential treatment (VHA Handbook 1160.01, 15.a.(5)(g)). In that many Veterans engaged in SUD-IOP treatment programs are homeless, temporary lodging for Veterans engaged in outpatient SUD treatment is an essential component for the  SUD Continuum of Care  as required by VHA Handbook 1160.04. 

The VA has an established policy for providing temporary lodging for individuals engaged in outpatient treatment:

 POLICY: It is VHA policy that while a Veteran or active duty Service member is undergoing an episode of care, VA may provide temporary lodging at either a VA Fischer House or other temporary lodging facility, as appropriate (VHA Directive 1107, 3.).

Specific authority to enter into these agreements is provided in VHA Handbook 1160.04 which reads in pertinent part:

Facilities may establish arrangements with community-based residential rehabilitation treatment facilities and transitional housing resources using agreements, contracts, or non-VA fee basis care to the extent the Veteran is eligible and that arrangements are consistent with 38 CFR  17.80 through 17.83. Sharing agreements, contracts, and non-VA fee basis care must provide access and quality of service that is consistent with VA standards. These residential and housing arrangements may facilitate access to outpatient care for SUD within VA or provide access to non-VA services that complement program elements available within VA programs (VHA Handbook 1160.04, section 8, g.).

This issue is further addressed in VHA Handbook 1160.01 which reads in part:

(4) Services addressing substance use conditions can be provided in VA facilities in SUD specialty care, in primary care and other medical care settings (especially in programs that integrate mental health and primary care), through programs integrating treatment for co-occurring mental health disorders and SUD (dual diagnoses) in mental health settings, or in community settings through sharing agreements, contracts, or non-VA fee basis care to the extent that the veteran is eligible. Regardless of the setting, the process of care must recognize the principle that SUDs are, in most cases, chronic or episodic and recurrent conditions that require ongoing care (VHA Handbook 1160.01, Section 15, a. (4)).

To provide the full continuum of care to SUD clients, this medical center desires to enter into a contractual agreement with a temporary lodging facility in the Grand Junction area which can meet the requirements listed in this Statement of Work (SOW).

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS

The contractor to provide temporary lodging for eligible Veterans involved in treatment with the WCHCS ADS outpatient program must meet all of the following requirements:

Per VHA Directive 1107, VA health care providers are responsible for determining the current medical stability of the Veteran and determining whether the Veteran is capable of self-care at the time of the temporary lodging. If the facility believes the Veteran to be medically unstable the Veteran will be directed to the WCHCS ER or 911 will be called based on the circumstances. If the facility believes the Veteran is not capable of self-care, the facility will notify the VA temporary housing coordinator or designee within one business day of this issue.

<a href="mailto:dana.weimar@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Naval Information Warfare Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific) hereby publicizes its intention to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole-source, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with Perspecta Labs, Inc. (Perspecta), of Basking Ridge, NJ for a follow-on contract to N66001-15-D-0271, which expired in September 2019. This action will provide telecommunication standards support to NIWC Pacific and Department of Homeland Securitys Emergency Communications Division (DHS ECD) to enhance existing National Security and Emergency Preparedness NS/EP services by enabling Next Generation Network Priority Services (NGN-PS) over the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks.  The engineering services and support that Perspecta currently provides to NIWC Pacific and DHS ECD are highly specialized. Executing a full and open competition would yield no viable alternate sources and would cause the program office and sponsor to incur a substantial duplication of cost, and significant schedule delays in fulfilling the requirements.  Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  NGN-PS is a program of record under the Presidents budget. The use of any other source for this acquisition would result in unacceptable delays because of the significant learning curve that would be required for resources from a new contractor(s) to be familiarized with Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) Communications Functions and NGN-PS.  Therefore, it has been determined that Perspecta Labs, Inc. is the only source that can perform this effort without substantial duplication of costs.  Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing that they can fulfill the requirement of providing this service may be considered by the agency. Interested parties shall identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, and must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any capabilities, comments, questions, or concerns regarding this notice may be submitted IN WRITING via e-mail to dana.weimar@navy.mil. A determination by the Government to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330, and the size standard is 500 employees.  The anticipated period of performance will be seven (7) years.  The estimated value of the effort is $25.3M. Questions and/or responses are due by 19 November 2019 at 1200 PT.

<RESPDATE>122019
<CONTACT>Yvette H. Dluhos, Contract Specialist, Email yvette.h.dluhos.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Background: <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) is required by law (10 U.S.C. &sect; 1074g) to establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System (MHS) which includes the purchase pharmaceutical agents. The law and implementing regulation (32 CFR Section 199.21) describe the process by which the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee will consider the relative clinical effectiveness and relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class in recommending the selection of agents for the DoD Uniform Formulary (UF) and, for cost sharing purposes, the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, Basic Core Formulary (BCF), Extended Core Formulary (ECF), or non-formulary (NF). Prior to the scheduled P&amp;T Committee meeting, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for pharmaceutical agents within Drug Classes identified for placement on the UF has been issued to obtain quotes from industry. The Defense Health Agency may award Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreements (UF BPA) and the Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program Agreements (UF ADP) based on the UF decision. This process is described in the attached RFQ.
<p>P&amp;T COMMITTEE MEETING: February 2020: The following drug classes/subclass and agents will be reviewed: <br /><br />Pain Agents, SUB CLASS: NSAID<br />Pain Agents, SUB CLASS: PAIN TOPICAL<br /><br />RFQ: The RFQ, including UF BPA and UF ADP appendices are attached herein. The historical utilization data<br />including quantity dispensed and 30 day equivalents by mouth is also attached herein.</p>
<p>PRE-Proposal Conference: See Paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 of the RFQ. Minutes will be posted herein.</p>
<p>POCs: Part 2.3 of the RFQ.</p>
<p>For additional information, search DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee at http://www.health.mil/POD</p>

<DESC>Contract Delivery Service - Contracting Opportunities
<p>Contract Delivery Service is a contractual agreement between the U.S. Postal Service and an individual or company for the delivery and collection of mail. The typical service required at the local Post Office<sup>TM</sup> will involve sorting mail for the route, driving to the route, delivering mail and parcels to specified addresses, picking up collection mail, and returning to the Post Office. The contract route will operate six days per week, Monday through Saturday, with possible Sunday deliveries and may include holidays. The carrier is required to use their own vehicle for mail delivery service.<br /><br />Contract Delivery Service carriers are not USPS employees but are independent contractors who provide service on specific routes. By becoming a contract delivery service supplier for the USPS, you sign on as an independent contractor who delivers and collects mail. You will not be an employee of the USPS, which means you won't be eligible for benefits.<br /><br />You will be required to pass both a background check and a drug test before the USPS can consider you for a contract delivery service contract. Even though you will not be an actual employee, the USPS is a government agency; which means an extensive screening process is necessary. You also must be 21 years old to be considered for a contractor position.</p>
<p>Further reference, detailed instructions, and required documents are included in the solicitation attachments.</p>
<p>Good Luck...and we look forward to your interest in joining Contract Delivery Services.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br /> (a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p><br />NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018) In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a)	Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.</p>
<p>(b) Requirements.</p>
<p>1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i.	Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.</p>
<p>ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i.	The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the<br />required elements set forth by NOAA's WorkplaceViolence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.</p>
<p>ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training.</p>
<p>iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.</p>
<p>iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.</p>
<p>(c)	Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 <br />&#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org <br />&#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) <br />&#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d)	Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.</p>
<p>(e)	Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; <br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; <br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; <br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; <br />5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>

<p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal  Contractors applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which  the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1 2017.  If this contract is covered by the EO the contractor must provide employees with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work up to 56 hours of paid sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their own illness injury or other health-related needs including preventive care; to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill injured or has other health-related needs including preventive care; or for reasons resulting from or to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is the victim of domestic violence sexual assault or stalking.  Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.54 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $181.60 per week or  $786.93 per month</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.22 per hour up to 40 hours per week or $168.80 per week or $731.47 per month*</p>
<p><br />*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA-covered contract also covered by EO 13706 Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors.  A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor 3 weeks after 8 years and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or <br />successor wherever employed and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (See 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday Washington's Birthday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Columbus Day Veterans' Day Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. (A <br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p><br />THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b) this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive administrative or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because <br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:</p>
<p>(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including consulting with users to determine hardware software or system functional specifications;</p>
<p>(2) The design development documentation analysis creation testing or modification of computer systems or programs including prototypes based on and related to user or system design specifications;</p>
<p>(3) The design documentation testing creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or</p>
<p>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.  If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordnance explosives and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening blending dying mixing and pressing of sensitive ordnance explosives and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization modification renovation demolition and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving re-grading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordnance (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands face or arms of the employee engaged in the operation irritation of the skin minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.  All operations involving unloading storage and hauling of ordnance explosive and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordnance explosives and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract by the employer by the state or local law etc.) the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost) reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear"" materials may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning daily washing or commercial <br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract by the contractor by law or by the nature of the work there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the ""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"" Fifth Edition (Revision 1) dated September 2015 unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard <br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e. the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e. appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)).  Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees <br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).  The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification wage rate and/or fringe benefits which shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification.  Failure to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract.  (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p><br />1) When preparing the bid the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification title(s) a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s) job description(s) and rationale for proposed wage rate(s) including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved or where there is no authorized representative the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees to the U.S. <br />Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt the Wage and Hour Division approves modifies or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request the ""Service Contract Act Directory of  Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember it is not the job title but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split combine or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."</p>

<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong>
<div>SEACOM, Ltd., suchita.ramphal@seacom.com, francis.ndegwa@seacom.com AND andre.haupt@seacom.com</div>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the enterprise market for fiber telecommunications services in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT BACKGROUND AND GRANTEE</span></p>
<p>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency ("USTDA") is providing a grant to SEACOM, Ltd. ("SEACOM") to fund a feasibility study to evaluate the enterprise market for fiber telecommunications services in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda. SEACOM launched a business strategy in South Africa in 2015 and Kenya in 2016 to expand its service offering beyond its primary offering of submarine and terrestrial cable communications into direct-to-enterprise network solutions for African business markets. SEACOM's business development team has led the push into new markets to increase and diversify revenue streams. Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda are being prioritized based on SEACOM's existing wholesale services operations in these territories, indicating SEACOM already understands the complex technical and regulatory landscape in these markets.</p>
<p>SEACOM, Ltd. is a private company located in Mauritius that owns and operates a submarine communications cable system, with an extensive network of submarine and terrestrial, high-speed fiber serving the east and west coasts of Africa with onward reach to and from Europe, India and Asia. The SEACOM cable network, which went operational in 2009, was an ambitious infrastructure project, confronting several hurdles related to financing, open access, and construction. Nevertheless, SEACOM was successful in overcoming these hurdles, and by building and operating the network, SEACOM dramatically expanded cost-effective access to reliable, high-speed internet services in Southern and Eastern Africa. SEACOM, a major pan-African service provider offers connectivity, data, voice and cloud services to enterprise customers in South Africa and Kenya, demonstrating its experience in the types of products and services that SEACOM seeks to offer. SEACOM's fibre and wireless data services provides businesses with access to high-speed, reliable and cost-effective Internet and VPN services via SEACOM's award winning, global high-speed data network. The network provides low latency access as well as highly scalable connectivity to businesses of any size and location.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDY COMPONENTS</span></p>
<p>The proposed Study would assess fiber and enterprise services market conditions and gaps in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania. While some countries, such as South Africa, are well-served by market research companies and have an abundance of easily available data on internet connectivity and penetration, fiber network maps, and other relevant information, in general, East African countries, do not have the same degree of data availability.</p>
<p>The specific objectives of the Study are (i) to help SEACOM determine whether or not there is a valid business case for introducing or expanding Layer 3 enterprise services in the target countries, and (ii) if such a business case exists, to develop a business plan for introducing and/or expanding such services in the target countries. SEACOM currently provides wholesale services in the target countries and enterprise services in Kenya. The outcome of such a Study would help SEACOM refocus its efforts in Kenya and determine whether there is a potential market in the other three target countries for its enterprise services.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $702,935 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</span></strong></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee via email at suchita.ramphal@seacom.com; francis.ndegwa@seacom.com AND andre.haupt@seacom.com by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">00:00H EAT (17:00H EST), December 6, 2019</span></strong>.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Upon request, the Contractor shall provide information necessary to determine the applicability of this clause.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(2) If the Contractor is a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society, the requirements of this clause do not apply with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on of the Contractor's activities (41 CFR 60-1.5).</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(5)</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(i) The Contractor shall not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because such employee or applicant has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the compensation of the employee or applicant or another employee or applicant. This prohibition against discrimination does not apply to instances in which an employee who has access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as a part of such employee's essential job functions discloses the compensation of such other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to such information, unless such disclosure is in response to a formal complaint or charge, in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the employer, or is consistent with the Contractor's legal duty to furnish information.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(ii) The Contractor shall disseminate the prohibition on discrimination in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this clause, using language prescribed by the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), to employees and applicants by-</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(6) The Contractor shall send, to each labor union or representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, the notice to be provided by the Contracting Officer advising the labor union or workers' representative of the Contractor's commitments under this clause, and post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(7) The Contractor shall comply with Executive Order11246, as amended, and the rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(8) The Contractor shall furnish to the contracting agency all information required by Executive Order11246, as amended, and by the rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor. The Contractor shall also file Standard Form100 (EEO-1), or any successor form, as prescribed in 41 CFR Part60-1. Unless the Contractor has filed within the 12 months preceding the date of contract award, the Contractor shall, within 30 days after contract award, apply to either the regional Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) or the local office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for the necessary forms.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(9) The Contractor shall permit access to its premises, during normal business hours, by the contracting agency or the OFCCP for the purpose of conducting on-site compliance evaluations and complaint investigations. The Contractor shall permit the Government to inspect and copy any books, accounts, records (including computerized records), and other material that may be relevant to the matter under investigation and pertinent to compliance with Executive Order11246, as amended, and rules and regulations that implement the Executive Order.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(10) If the OFCCP determines that the Contractor is not in compliance with this clause or any rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, this contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part and the Contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts, under the procedures authorized in Executive Order11246, as amended. In addition, sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the Contractor as provided in Executive Order11246, as amended; in the rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor; or as otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(11) The Contractor shall include the terms and conditions of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that is not exempted by the rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued under Executive Order11246, as amended, so that these terms and conditions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(12) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the Director of OFCCP may direct as a means of enforcing these terms and conditions, including sanctions for noncompliance, provided, that if the Contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of any direction, the Contractor may request the United States to enter into the litigation to protect the interests of the United States.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(d) Notwithstanding any other clause in this contract, disputes relative to this clause will be governed by the procedures in 41 CFR 60-1.</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(1) [_]Are, [_]are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(2) [_]Have, [_]have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(3) [_]Are, [_]are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(4) [_]Have, [_]have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) ( 26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>As prescribed in 19.309(c), insert the following clause:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Jul 2013)</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is not dominant in its field of operation when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(3) For long-term contracts-</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Contractor represents that it [_X_] is, [_] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code __611699__ assigned to contract number ____.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Details for the interview will be emailed to the individual agencies by NOTIFICATION LETTER TO SHORTLISTED FIRMS.</p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />GSA is soliciting Architectural and Engineering (A/E) services to be utilized by GSA Region 8. The contracts resulting from this solicitation may be used to support GSA and GSA customer agencies.<br />The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) applicable to this project is 541310, Architectural Services, which has a size standard of $7.5 million in average annual receipts.
<p>PROCUREMENT DESCRIPTION<br />This acquisition is being procured in accordance with the Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. This procurement is set-aside for Small Business concerns.</p>
<p><br />The Brooks Act (Public Law 92-582), also known as Qualifications Based Selection (QBS), which was enacted on October 18, 1972, establishes the procurement process by which a firm is selected for award of a federal government contract to perform architect/engineer (A/E) services. The Brooks Act establishes a qualifications-based selection process, in which contracts for A/E services are negotiated on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of professional services required at a fair and reasonable price. Under QBS procurement procedures, price quotations are not a consideration in the selection process. There are seven basic steps involved in pursuing federal design work under QBS:</p>
<p>1. Public Announcement <br />The request for qualifications solicitation will be posted in Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps).</p>
<p>2. Statements of Qualification <br />A/E firms with an interest in being considered for design services contracts must submit written information in response to the Stage I factors in the solicitation.</p>
<p>3. Evaluation of Submissions <br />GSA will review the written information submitted in response to the solicitation Stage I factors in the Fed Biz Opportunity notice.</p>
<p>4. Development of a Short-list (Stage I) <br />Following the evaluation of the written information submitted in response to the solicitation Stage I factors, GSA will rank the most highly qualified firms for each Zone for the purpose continuing with the interview process</p>
<p>5. Interviews with Short-list Firms (Stage II) <br />The interview shall involve the submission of information by the short-list firms about (a) anticipated concepts, (b) the relative utility of alternative methods for furnishing services, and (c) feasible ways to prescribe the use of recovered materials and achieve waste reduction and energy-efficiency in facility design. The evaluation of this information is the least important for selection of firms for negotiations for award of a contract under this solicitation, and will be used only to make a more meaningful ranking. The interview will also be used to permit the short-list firms to substitute for, or augment, written information in response to the solicitation Stage I factors. The consideration of information in the interview is subject to the same restrictions as written information. The A/E firm interview will occur after the evaluation of any written information submitted by the A/E firm in response to the solicitation Stage I factors. The interviews will be held at the agency's office in person with the A/E firm or with the A/E firm participating via video teleconferencing as agreed by the Government and the A/E firm. The selected firms are allowed up to 30 minutes each for the interview.</p>
<p>7. Stage II Evaluation <br />GSA will evaluate the interview information submitted.</p>
<p>8. Recommendation for Negotiation and Award <br />Following its evaluations for Stage I and Stage II, GSA will select for negotiations for award of a contract under this solicitation.</p>
<p>9. Selection of Firms for Negotiation and Award <br />In order of preference - up to five (5) firms per Zone (Zone 1; Colorado, Zone 2; Wyoming, Zone 3; Utah, Zone 4; Montana, Zone 5; South Dakota, Zone 6; North Dakota) GSA will select the most highly qualified A/E firms for negotiation and award to provide the A/E Services. <br /><br />Each A/E firm shall select a Primary Zone in which it has a bonafide place of business, as defined in the SBA's regulations, there and is licensed to perform the required A/E services there. An A/E may also select more than one Primary Zone so long as it has a bonafide place of business in that Zone and is licensed to perform the required A/E services in that Zone. The firms may also choose one or more Alternate Zone so long as it is licensed to perform the required A/E services in that Alternate Zone. <br />In the selection for negotiation and award for each Zone, preference will be given to qualified firms that have selected the Zone as the firm's Primary Zone. These qualified firms will be deemed as highly qualified firms for purposes of negotiation and award for that Zone, and negotiations and, if possible, award to these firms will be made first for each Zone before consideration is given to other firms for which the Zone is only an Alternate Zone. If award for a Zone is made to five firms that each selected the Zone as the firm's Primary Zone, then no other firms will be considered for negotiation and award for that Zone. For ease and efficiency of contract administration or the lack of highly qualified firms, IDIQ contracts may be awarded to fewer than five firms per zone. <br />Consideration for award of an order for a Zone will be limited to the firms awarded an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for that Zone. However, IDIQ contract holders from other zones that are licensed to perform the required A/E services in that Zone may be considered, to the extent necessary and permitting an efficient competition, for award of an order for work in that Zone under the following conditions; lack of sufficient competition among the IDIQ contract holders for that Zone, the Estimated Construction Contract Amount (ECCA) is expected to exceed the $500,000.00 threshold, or under unusual and compelling circumstances. <br />The negotiations will be conducted pursuant to the procedures set forth in FAR 36.606. The government will negotiate the hourly rates for each of the A/E firm's disciplines for the base year period and four (4) consecutive one-year option periods under the Primary Design and Secondary Services. Proposed fees will be compared to an Independent Government Estimate to determine price reasonableness, realism, and balance. If a firm's pricing determined to be unreasonable, unrealistic, or unbalanced, that firm may be removed from consideration, and the next most highly qualified firm will be considered. GSA shall select the most highly qualified rated firms for award for each Zone that has reasonable, realistic, and balanced pricing.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the solicitation is to address questions from prospective vendors.
Question 1:  Can you give a reason as to why the current contract was not extended   or why the option year was not exercised? 
Answer 1: All the elements of FAR 17.207(c) were not met.
Question 2:  Can you site any deficiencies with the current contract holder regarding their work at the cemetery? 
Answer 2: No.  A Freedom for Information Act (FOIA) request would be the proper means to obtain this information.
Question 3:  On page 3 paragraph 3.1 the SOW states that weekly mow/trim service will need to be provided during the growing season (February - November) however the pricing format shows that service will be needed for 52 weeks. Also, can you please clarify if services during the non-growing season are on an "as needed" basis, or if we'll be called in. 
Answer 3: The quantities in the schedule are estimates only. See Attachment A, Section 3.1.1. for acceptable grass heights.
Question 4:  The SOW says leaves are to be removed from internment areas. Is this basically meaning the improved areas or just areas around the headstones or columbarium areas? 
Answer 4: For all improved areas; Leaves, nuts, and twigs shall be hand raked, vacuumed or blown by walk-behind push type machines from interment areas into the roadways, and then collected and properly disposed of from Cemetery grounds which includes right of way outside Cemetery fence. Any accumulations of mulched leaves shall be removed from the Cemetery grounds and properly disposed of.
Question 5:  Paragraph 3.1.11.5 says that all walkways roads and parking areas must be swept. Are we able to use blowers? 
Answer 5: Mechanical machines as blowers can be use for small particles; for large items hand picked; brooms and/or sweepers should be used. At no time any chemicals will be used. 
Question 6:  Can you please provide the current company that's providing the service and the price of their last option year was? 
Answer 6: Provided in amendment A0001.
Question 7:  Does the cemetery have irrigation throughout the improved areas? 
Answer 7: Yes.
Question 8:  Can you provide the average number of services that are held per week? 
Answer 8: 6 / week.
Question 9:  Will you accept PPIRS/CPARS reports in lieu or a past performance report? 
Answer 9: Yes.

<p><strong>PM Response:</strong> The attached file can be used as minimum requirements. Please see attachment labeled "Nett Warrior Connectors Specification".</p>
<p>2. Is there an IP rating requirement, and is that requirement applicable in the mated condition only or also in the unmated condition?</p>
<p><strong>PM Response:</strong> Minimum rating would be IP67 mated and unmated.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the desire to have "Bulkhead features option", would that be a panel-mount or flat-mount? Would it also need to mount to a molle loop, or be affixed to a garment?</p>
<p><strong>PM Response:</strong> The primary use for the connector will be to mount to/through MOLLE Loops without modification to the load carriage system fabric (i.e. Not sewn in). The secondary use could see the connector being mounted to the surface of a module/components of Soldier kit.</p>

<CONTACT>Ingrid V Smith, Contracting Officer, Phone 8042793148, Email Ingrid.Smith@dla.mil
<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This notice has been updated to include the anticipated population of consumables subject to this potential acquisition.&nbsp; Additionally, the response date has been accelerated to 12 Nov 19.&nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research and to gauge potential interest in this anticipated support program. The Government seeks information that will be used as part of an analysis to determine if responsible sources exist to designate this effort as a competitive acquisition. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 336413 which has a corresponding size standard of 1,250 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in responses from all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, HUBZone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. </span></p>
<p>This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the Government. Under this potential supply chain management contract, a contractor will carry out logistics functions for the MH-60 platform via a phased or customer focused approach. DLA Aviation at Richmond anticipates possible award, on a sole-source basis, of a contract for the acquisition of supply chain management support and logistics management, which may include supply support on a DLA direct basis, demand/planning forecasting, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage/warehousing, reliability improvements, and field customer service/engineering support of the MH-60 manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft and the associated MH-60 Bill of Materials (BOM) of DLA managed consumable parts to support United States Navy (USN), Army (USA), Marine Corps (USMC) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.</p>
<p>The overarching objectives of this acquisition are to: (1) decrease MH-60 repair delays due to outstanding consumable requirements; and (2) accelerate the Fleet Readiness Centers (FRC) Programmed Maintenance Interval (PMI) turnaround time through enhanced material availability and cross talk between Navy Repair of Repairable (ROR) contract repair and FRC concurrent repairs. In order to meet these objectives, the contractor must have the ability to drive changes into the weapons system configuration and, more importantly, understand, analyze, and assess the implications-both in terms of performance and operational usage-of any potential configuration change.</p>
<p>A Supplier Initiated Ordering (SIO) system is projected for use in meeting the aforementioned objectives. Monthly Lot Payments or Transactional SIO are contemplated at this time. Regardless of the SIO strategy selected, the Contractor will utilize DLA demand data as well as intelligence gathered with Contractor service representatives at the FRC to forecast future demands and identify buy requirements for DLA to ensure Fill Rate and Material Availability performance increases from baseline performance, and over the life of the contract. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies via DLA Direct terms/delivery points as directed within specified timeframes. The contractor shall be responsible for forecasting, acquiring, stocking, and fulfilling requirements via its commercial operation/facility utilized to meet contract requirements. In addition to filling material requirements, the contractor may be required to make recommendations for Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) along with being responsible for obsolescence management and mitigating Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMSMS) challenges for the MH-60 Bill of Materials (BOM).</p>
<p>A transition period will occur post award where the Contractor will ramp up its supply chain to meet performance requirements. Open DLA contracts will continue to deliver and the Contractor will have visibility of such pending assets in the Government supplied data. As this and overall supportability will vary for each item within the BOM, an integrated solution, dedicated program management team will be required to ensure fill rate and material availability performance improvements and zero degradation of support.</p>
<p>Performance metrics associated with this acquisition may be tied to local (FRC customers) and DLA (worldwide) material availability. Small business participation and reliability improvements are also potential metrics.</p>
<p>The contract will allow for an expansion of support based on developing and evolving MH-60 requirements from DLA and/or USN/USMC/USA or other customers.</p>
<p>Any entity interested/able to provide any of the required products but cannot provide the required supply chain management solution may be afforded an opportunity to partner with an interested prime contractor, or participate as a subcontractor. Please identify any anticipated teaming arrangements under the acquisition herein, along with a description of similar support and teaming arrangements offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>Entities seeking to become an approved source of supply for possible subcontracting opportunities under this acquisition should note that the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. Sources that are not approved for manufacture of these items must obtain source approval from the Government.</p>
<p>Please provide the following business information in your response: Company Name, Address, CAGE Code, Point of Contact, Phone, Email and web page URL if available. Also please describe what small business type or category you represent, if applicable.</p>
<p>Any responses to this Potential Sources Sought should include responses to the following:</p>
<p>1. Describe your experience executing relevant supply chain management programs. What do you envision as the risk areas associated with this effort and how would you mitigate those risks?</p>
<p>2. Is your interest in this effort as a prime or subcontractor?</p>
<p>3. Describe your capabilities in performing the supply chain functions: demand forecasting, supplier management, inventory management, warehousing, configuration management, obsolescence management, training, and sustaining engineering/maintaining reliability.</p>
<p>4. Describe the transition and implementation actions and timeframes your firm would identify/need to successfully execute the anticipated requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>5. For a FAR 15 acquisition effort as described herein for approximately 1,000 consumable items, what do you anticipate as a reasonable proposal turn-around time? This assumes a portion of items will exceed TINA thresholds and be subject to Cost or Pricing Data requirements. <br /><br />6. What quality control systems/measures do you currently have in place (ISO 9000, 9001, AS9100, NADCAP (National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program)?</p>
<p>7. Describe your experience with Government Source Inspection, Critical Safety Items, and OSHA standards.</p>
<p>8. How many employees are in your company?</p>
<p>9. Are you currently registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and Wide Area Workflow (WAWF)? Do you currently utilize Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) functionality? If so, what transaction sets? Do you currently have access to any Government systems, authorized for use in performance of another Government contract? If so, please explain.</p>
<p>10. What suggestions, if any, do you have for this potential supply chain management SIO effort (including evaluation criteria, CLIN structure, contract structure, incentive/disincentive structure and application, data requirements, or other elements)?</p>
<p>11. Do you possess all the necessary technical data to perform this potential contract?</p>
<p>12. Do you have electronic interface capability with military inventory control points?</p>
<p>13. Describe your experience with ECPs and obsolescence and modeling/simulation capabilities for the MH-60 platform? <br /><br />Disclaimer</p>

The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined at this time. We DO NOT have an anticipated release date for a SIR.

Attachment 0001, Market Survey Questions, is included as part of this market survey.

This information must be provided on the form, Attachment 0001 - Market Survey Questions. Vendors may provide additional information relevant to the market survey.

Industry participation, while encouraged, is strictly voluntary. Failure to provide a response will not prevent a vendor from submitting a formal response to the FAA's release of a future SIR. Vendor participation in any market analysis activity is not a promise of future business with the FAA.

This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred by vendors in preparing its response to this market survey.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR BID - PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE</strong>
<p><strong>CA FLAP INY CR2022(1) South Lake Road</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Location</strong></p>
<p>South Lake Road, also designated as County Road 2022, is located in Inyo County, California, and provides access to South Lake, Inyo National Forest lands, several campgrounds, lodges, trailheads, picnic areas, and numerous privately-owned properties.  The route begins at the junction with State Route 168, approximately 15 miles southwest of Bishop, and continues 6.9 miles to South Lake.  The route is primarily on US Forest Service land (Inyo National Forest), and is maintained by Inyo County.  The route is functionally classified as a rural major collector.  Facilities along the route are associated with the use of adjacent lands, and the majority of traffic on South Lake Road is related to recreational use in the forest.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of the Work</strong></p>
<p>The existing South Lake Road is a two-lane paved roadway with varying widths and variable width unpaved shoulders, as well as multiple paved and unpaved pull-offs and intersecting roadways. Roadway shoulder widths are typically narrow or non-existent. The roadway surface is showing signs of deterioration including thermal and block cracking with some areas showing signs of fatigue cracking. The speed limit on the route is currently not posted, with the exception of two locations posted at 25 mph and 15 mph.  The entire 6.9 miles is in steep mountainous terrain with narrow roadway bench widths along the majority of the route.  There are numerous recreational facilities and parking areas adjacent to the roadway throughout the route.  There is heavy pedestrian and bicycle use along portions of the route and the average daily traffic is approximately 800.</p>
<p>The proposed road improvements include pulverizing and paving, minor widening, grading, and drainage improvements to 6.9 miles of South Lake Road and adjacent campgrounds and parking facilities.  Specific project elements, which would generally follow the existing roadway, include the following:</p>
<p>1)	Segment 1: Rehabilitate and widen the first 2.1 miles from the intersection with State Route 168 to the Bishop Creek Lodge and Resort to accommodate a widened, shared-use shoulder. The proposed roadway section for this segment is 28 feet wide with 11-foot lanes and 3-foot shoulders. The existing paved width along this segment varies from 24-27 feet, with a wider bench width. Grading, including cuts and fills, will be required where the proposed section does not fit within the existing<br /> <br />roadway bench.  Construction of left-turn lanes into the Four Jeffrey Campground is also included in Segment 1.<br />2)	Segment 2: Rehabilitate the next 4.8 miles from the Bishop Creek Lodge and Resort to the end of the project at South Lake. The proposed paved roadway section for this segment is 22 feet with 10-foot lanes and 1-foot shoulders. The existing paved width along this segment varies from 21-26 feet. In general, the original paved roadway width will be maintained, with only minimal widening proposed to maintain a consistent paved width.<br />3)	Drainage improvements in Segments 1 and 2, including the repair or replacement of 2 larger corrugated metal pipes with headwalls.  Dewatering will be required at the 2 larger culverts.<br />4)	Improvements to paved and unpaved pullouts maintained by the County.<br />5)	Improvements to paved and unpaved pullouts maintained by the Forest Service, including:<br />&bull;	Grading, paving, signing, and striping a bike staging area at a current unpaved informal pullout;<br />&bull;	Pulverizing, paving, and striping the dump station at Four Jeffrey's Campground;<br />&bull;	Grading, paving, signing, and striping the Tyee Lakes Trailhead<br />&bull;	Pulverizing, paving, signing, and striping several existing paved parking areas; and    <br />&bull;	Pulverizing and paving the boat ramp at the end of South Lake Road <br />6)	Improvements to 4 Forest Service Campgrounds and the South Lake Trailhead parking area.  Improvements include pulverizing, paving, striping, signing, roadbed reconditioning with new surface course aggregate, and minor drainage improvements.<br />7)	Slope scaling of existing slopes with unstable rock.<br />8)	Upgrading regulatory/warning signs and guardrails to meet MUTCD guidelines.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for Stellenbosch Nanofiber Company.
<p>The National Institutes of Health NIH/NEI needs to obtain a contract for Scientific Medical instruments HESKA DRI-CHEM 7000 Chemistry Analyzers and Element HT5 Analyzers. These units are custom explicitly designed and programed by the manufacturer. <br />The HESKA DRI-CHEM 7000 analyzes blood, urine, and stool chemistry tests, which signal the possible presence of disease. The Element HT5 Analyzers provides a five-part white blood cell differential as well as red blood cell and platelet parameters using laser, impedance, and colorimetric technologies. Having the capability of running the above samples in-house allows for the veterinarian to diagnose and treat immediately, potentially providing life-saving therapies to our valuable research animals.</p>
<p><br />Responses<br />The proposed acquisition action is for items and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b). If you believe you can provide the items or services, please forward capability statement lisa.ingram@nih.gov by November 5, 2019, and reference solicitation number NIH-OLAO-OD5-NOI20-000017 A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract acquisition based upon responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<p>For contractual/technical questions, please use ProjNet as detailed below.</p>
<p>All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management, which indicates "All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)." Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a unique entity identifier for processing their registration. Refer to www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.</p>
<p>Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected.</p>
<p>ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter to SAM appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration.</p>
<p>Effective June 29, 2018 vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM. Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: SAM is completely free of charge for both registrants and users.</p>

If your firm is a Small Business, certified HUBZone, 8A, Woman-Owned Small Business or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business and you are interested in this project please respond appropriately.</p>
<p>This project is a Full Facility Restoration (FFR) project of three barracks buildings 207, 208, and 230 located at Fort Hunter Liggett, CA. The design/build barracks renovation project comprises a total of approximately 114,570 square feet (38,190 SF per project).

Offeror's bonding capability (construction bonding level per contract and aggregate construction bonding level, both expressed in dollars).<br />4. If this requirement consolidated two of the building renovations into one single contract, rather than three single contracts, would that change your decision to propose and impact your ability to perform? If yes, please provide a detailed explanation. (NOTE: Possible combinations include: 207 and 208, 207 and 230, or 208 and 230)<br />5. If the Louisville District established one consolidated contract rather than three single contracts, would that change your decision to propose and impact your ability to perform? If yes, please provide a detailed explanation.<br />6. Offerors should also include capability to execute full design and designer of record responsibilities on design build repair/construction projects, or address relationships with design firm that can perform full design services.<br />7.

This can be demonstrated through multiple buildings under one contract or task order.</p>
<p>Note: An offeror demonstrating the ability to perform at the 90,000 SF will be understood to be capable of performing the 60,000 and 30,000 SF so separate projects for each level are not needed.</p>
<p>c. Based on the information above, for each project submitted, include:<br />1. Current percentage of construction complete and the date when it was or will be completed.<br />2. Scope of the project. <br />3. Size of the project (dollar value and square feet).<br />4. The dollar value of the construction contract and whether it was design-bid build or design-build. <br />5.

It does not constitute a Solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. All firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award.
<p>The information from this market research will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research. The Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research.<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District (USACE) is planning a construction project in the City of Montevideo, Chippewa County, along the Twin Cities and Western Railroad (Railroad) in the State of Minnesota. The project requires railroad closure work, in an area of low head room under a MnDOT bridge, which consists of construction of an emergency flood barrier across the Railroad alignment. It is anticipated that a reinforced concrete closure measuring approximately 29 feet wide will be required. The scope of this work will include, but is not limited to, excavation, installation of a cast-in-place reinforced concrete base, installation of steel sheet pile flood barrier I-wall (approximately 80 total feet of 25' long sheet pile) that will tie into the MnDOT embankments, construction of reinforced concrete stop log slots and sill, backfill of the structure, and procurement and fit testing of stop logs. Ancillary construction items included in this project include construction of earthen berms on the MnDOT embankment and stripping of drainage ditches. Temporary shoring may be needed to meet railroad live loading and MnDOT standards. Tight project schedule communication and coordination with MnDOT and the Railroad while the track is closed is critical. The maximum duration of track closure is expected to be 48 hours.</p>
<p>Interested vendors with experience in this type of construction project work within NAICS Code 237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction are encouraged to send capabilities statements electronically to:</p>
<p>Toni Wasgatt. USACE St Paul District Contracting<br />toni.w.wasgatt@usace.army.mil</p>
