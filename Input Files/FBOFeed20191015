<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p>The Government intends to award a fixed price purchase order to Blood Bank Computer Systems, Aubum, MA 98001.</p>
<p>This request is in direct support of the Donor application (BBCS) used at NIH/CC/DTM. The BBCS Donor application manages Blood and subsequent product distribution to patients at the NIH Clinical Center. The BBCS request is for security auditing tools on the BBCS infrastructure servers. Per HHS regulation, servers are required to be monitored against intrusions by the computer hacking community.</p>
<p>The DTM is a unique blood center which collects blllod and blood components from healthy donors to treat patients participating in many protocols. Blood components are collected to support biomedical research performed in laboratories at NIH, and patients alos donate blood products to determine the therapeutic benefit of removing various blood components or to obtain blood components needed to treat their medical condition. Numerous regulatory authorities, specifically the Food and and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) set policy and enforce this policy for use, monitoring and maintenance of equipment and systems that are used in support of patient care. The use of a validated IT system is standard of care for both blood collectors and transfusion services. It systems in blood collection facilities are considered a medical device and must be FDA approved unlike all other hospital IT systems.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Philadelphia Division (NSWCPD) intends to increase the contract ceiling authorized for the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract N65540-14-D-0002, awarded to Northrop Grumman Maritime Systems (NGMS). Contract N65540-14-D-0002 provides design agent engineering and technical services for the overall management, development, testing, troubleshooting, repair, configuration, maintenance and fleet sustainment of fielded steering control and navigation control systems, including Ship Control System (SCS), Waterjet Control System, Voyage Management System (VMS), Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) Machinery Control System (MCS), and Engineering Control System (ECS).<br />This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. Furthermore, this procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This modification is being issued to avoid a break in service while the follow-on acquisition is in process, which will also be negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. It is critical that the work continues until the competitive follow-on contract is awarded. This is not a request for quote from any other contractors.</p>
<p>The sole source follow-on acquisition will be solicited under a separate Request For Proposal (RFP) with a number to be determined at a later date. The RFP will be made available electronically upon its release to the Federal Business Opportunities portal.</p>
<p>To acquire the required services for the remaining ordering period, the Navy intends to solicit for a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) modification to increase the ceiling on the existing contract, N65540-14-D-0002, to provide continuous contractual coverage through the ordering period ending 04/30/20.</p>
<p>The Terms and Conditions of the current contract applies to this sole source modification.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 34511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing and the size standard is 1250.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

The BOA will provide for the furnishing of labor, material, reports and parts as may be required to restore 1 NIINs to serviceable operating condition on the P-8.  

NIIN 016219064

Cox  and  Company Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 3116 or is available on-line at: 
https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. 

Responses to this notice of intent shall be submitted no later than one (1) day from the date of this synopsis to NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia, Attn: Ms. Kelly Florczak, Contract Negotiator, Code (N732.55), 700 Robbins Ave, Bldg 1, Philadelphia, PA 19111.

The U.S. Army Fort Belvoir is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support the requirement for Data Program Management Office Support. A (continuing) need is anticipated for the Data Program Management Office Support which is currently being fulfilled through contract #W91QUZ-06-D-0019 2M04. We encourage all business size entities to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement as outlined in the associated Performance Work Statement (PWS) at a fair market price.
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or IFB or RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The anticipated NAICS code is: 541611 "Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services." The size standard is $16.5M.</p>

<p>1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any. The Government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential sources for this requirement. Note: Please note changes to the Limitations on<br />Subcontracting requirements found in FAR clauses 52.219-3, 52.219-14. 52.219-27, 52.219-29 and 52.219-30.</p>
<p>3. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>

<p>5. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>

Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>7. Recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE INFORMATION
<p>Agency/Office: <br />Defense Health Agency</p>
<p>Location:<br />Contracting Office- Falls Church</p>
<p>Title:<br />Laboratory Developed Testing</p>
<p>Description(s):<br />Request for Information</p>
<p>Title: Laboratory Developed Testing<br />Introduction:</p>
<p>1. This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that a solicitation will be issued. This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation For Bid (IFB).</p>
<p>2. Please note that the collection of this requested information does not obligate the U.S. Government to incorporate any solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to procure services. Proprietary information should not be included in the RFI response. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is not liable to pay any costs associated with companies responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>3. All information received resulting from this RFI will be used by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) for acquisition planning and market research purposes only. However, your response may be releasable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). If you wish the DHA to consider any portion of your response as "confidential commercial information", you should clearly mark the portion as "confidential commercial information".</p>
<p>4. The Defense Health Agency (DHA), at its discretion, may request respondents to this RFI to elaborate on information in their written response. Respondents to this RFI will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided.</p>
<p>5. The DHA invites all interested parties to submit a written response to this Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is issued for the sole purpose of conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.</p>
<p>Background<br />The DHA is the DoD organization responsible for managing the TRICARE health care benefits. This includes integrating state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. Under DHA, the Enterprise Support Activities initiative was established with the goal to consolidate resources, standardization, and reengineer processes. These are essential elements in order to improve performance, decrease costs, and enable the Military Health System (MHS) to operate more efficiently as an integrated health system. As part of this goal, DHA is seeking information from industry to assist in the implementation and deployment of a comprehensive and commercially available Laboratory Developed Test Solution for the Military Health System (MHS). The Center for Laboratory Medicine Services office ensures regulatory compliance across the MHS Laboratories. They also advise, evaluate, establish policy involving laboratory standards and approve laboratory developed tests.</p>
<p>The Defense Health Agency's Clinical Laboratory Medicine Services will hold an Industry Day on October 24, 2019. This will be a virtual meeting. The purpose of Industry Day is to gather information from vendors that perform Laboratory Developed Testing (LDT). Tests presented during this event may be included in the battery of tests being evaluated during the next Defense Health Agency's Laboratory Joint Working Group.</p>
<p>Information Submission Instructions:<br />There will be 10 presentations and each presenter will have 40 minutes. The 40 minutes includes 5 minutes for preparation, 25 minutes for presentations, and 10 minutes for panel questions. Each individual vendor will be allocated one 40 minute time slot. A vendor may register for only one time slot. Time slots will be organized by similar test types. Registration will be available to the first 10 vendors. Additional industry days will be added to allow all vendors who register a chance to present their LDT. <br />Vendors should submit a summary of their submission in the format provided (see attachment) no later than (NLT) COB October 22, 2019. A summary should accompany each test presented. Vendors may submit a directory of laboratory tests their laboratory performs. All submissions and presentation information should be submitted to: Linda.M.Walker38.civ@mail.mil and Tatanya.L.Cooper.mil@mail.mil. Registration requests/and or questions concerning this event should also be directed to Tatanya Cooper, Tatanya.L.Cooper.mil@mail.mil or at: 703-681-7317.</p>

SET-ASIDES, LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING AND THE NON-MANUFACTURER RULE (NMR)

Complete responses to this notice will assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside for the requirement.  Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.  If a requirement shall result from this RFI / Sources Sought, the limitations on subcontracting and non-manufacturer rule shall be included in any future solicitation.  The requirement that a non-manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R.  121.406].  To qualify as a small business concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R.  125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States.  

To qualify as a small business under a small business set-aside contract, the offeror must be considered a small business under the NAICS code assigned to the procurement.  In addition, the small business must either (1) be the manufacturer of the end item being produced (and the end item must be produced in the US) or (2) comply with the non-manufacturing regulations in 13 CFR 121.406.  

Summary of Non-Manufacturing regulations:
The small business cannot exceed 500 employees;
The small business is primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sells the type of item being supplied;
The small business takes ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment, or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practices; and 
The small business will supply the end item of a small business manufacturer, processor, or producer made in the United States, unless the SBA has issued a waiver to this requirement.  When multiple items are being acquired, a waiver is not required if at least 50% of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured by small businesses.  

Additional information can be found on SBA s website (www.sba.gov) and in SBA s Contracting Guide (https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide). 

Essential Information Regarding Small Business Set-Asides for Veteran-Owned Small Businesses
VA s Veterans First Contracting Program:  The Veterans First Contracting Program applies to VA contracts only.  VA has a preference to award contracts to verified service disabled Veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) first, and then to verified Veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) when market research provides a reasonable expectation that the VA will receive two or more offers from eligible SDVOSB/VOSB firms at a fair and reasonable price.  To be eligible for a VA SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside, the firm must be verified in the VA s Office of Small Business Utilization s (OSDBU) Veteran Information Pages (VIP) database as an SDVOSB or VOSB at the time the firm submits its offer to the VA.  Additional information on VA s Veterans First Contracting Program can be found on OSDBU s website at https://www.va.gov/osdbu/verification/.  In addition, the SDVOSB/VOSB must qualify as a small business under SBA s regulations.  

AUTHORIZED DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR VERIFICATION

For market research, the VA must be able to determine if an item is being sourced from the gray market or if the item is being provided by an authorized dealer/distributor.

<DESC>The research program of at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System requires a reliable, automated radiotracer synthesis system capable of utilizing simple plug-in kits to produce a variety of [F-18] fluoride based radiotracers via nucleophilic synthesis. Syntheses provided by the system must include [18F]Fallypride, 2-[18F]F-A-85380, [18F]Fdopa, [18F]FMiso, and [18F]PSMA-1007. The system must include a platform with the capability to fine tune these radiotracer syntheses, develop custom syntheses with their associated graphical reaction pathways, and install new radiotracer syntheses for immediate operation. It must be ready to connect to an external HPLC pump and provide the display of the HPLC detector signals.  As radiation may affect electrically-driven actuators, a pneumatic system is key to the accuracy and reliability of this system.  Positioning of the CPU outside the hot cell provides similar support for electronic system components, and the system must have self-test capabilities for the sake of performing preventative maintenance.  The synthesizer must comply with FDA 21 CFR Part 11, with a validated platform that has a Certificate of Conformity with the FDA.

Brand Name or Equal to PET Radiotracer automated synthesizer for the production of radiotracers to be used in VAGLAHS clinical and research applications.

Security clearance is not required. Vendors will not install, upgrade or access VA systems or VA patient sensitive information.  The system is a stand-alone system not integrated with the VA IT.

Based on responses to this synopsis, the Government may issue this RFQ as a Brand Name or Equal requirement in accordance with VAAR Clause 852.211-73 on eBuy or Fed Biz Ops. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement and who is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), authorized dealer, authorized distributor or authorized reseller of all the items listed above, may submit a capability statement to the contracting office than no later than Monday, October 21, 2019 4:00 PM EST.

<DESC>A full task order request or solicitation is anticipated closer to the project start date. The purpose of this early notice is to alert interested parties of a future requirement for planting/release on the Modoc National Forest to allow site visitation in advance of winter weather. Exact contract start date is dependent upon site conditions and award may be made in advance of spring thaw.<br /><br />The solicitation will be set aside at least to small business.<br /><br />Project Description: The intent of this contract is to plant conifer seedlings at various spacing within the Cove, Stone and Turner Burn areas in the spring of 2020. These areas burned in 2017 and 2018. The Cove and Stone units are located on the Big Valley Ranger District and the Turner units are located on the Devil's Garden Ranger District. Project will be by the tree rather than acre with an estimated 222,000 trees to be planted.<br /><br />Access: Access will be a limiting factor in the spring. The use of UTV's and ATV's will be a must for some of the project areas especially in the Turner area due to very wet soppy road conditions. <br /><br />Tree spacing: various, such to yield approximately 150 trees per acre<br /><br />Planting Method: Hoedad, shovel or auger<br /><br />Trees to be planted: Planting stock will be 1-0 bare root Ponderosa and Jeffery pine. There may be some plug stock as well of the same species.<br /><br />Conifer Release: 5' radius around every planted seedling. At this time there is no brush component only a little grass and forbs. It is anticipated that after logging operations the project sites will be even cleaner of vegetation. <br /><br />Estimated start date: April 1, 2020<br /><br />Site Visit: An organized site visit is not scheduled so interested contractors are encourage to visit the site during fall while access is available as it will likely not be available at the time of the solicitation.<br /><br /><br />No proposals are requested at this time. Interested parties will receive notification when the project is solicited. Alternatively, interested parties may subscribe to this notice on FBO.

<p>This project consists of stand thinning and fuel reduction treatments within whitebark pine stands impacted by mountain pine beetle epidemic in the Green Mountain area (Conservation area 802). The project area is located in T34S R 15 E on the Paisley Ranger District and is easily accessed from the 3323019 road system.<br />&nbsp;<br />Proposed treatments include pruning, mechanical thinning plus fuel treatment. There may be a small component of hand thinning. Due to the severity of the mountain pine epidemic, all stands contain danger trees with a likely to imminent failure potential.<br /><br />This project is designed to protect and promote stand health and vigor of existing whitebark pine and reduce the risk of wildfire within the whitebark pine stands. Whitebark pine is listed as a Candidate species for review as a Threatened or Endangered species. Until the time of review by the Fish and Wildlife Service, whitebark pine is considered a sensitive species. <br /><br />Please see enclosed maps. Units are currently identified on the ground with orange flagging and white tags. Additional units may be identified as time and contract funding warrant. <br /><br />This project will likely be ordered against a new Blanket Purchase Agreement, (BPA),&nbsp;which should be posted to FBO this winter. If the new BPA is posted, this Special Notice will likely be updated with information regarding the new BPA.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is the fluorescence that is emitted by a photosynthetic body during photosynthesis. Studying this fluorescence enables researchers to understand how different plants react to changing environmental conditions. However, monitoring SIF is notoriously difficult to do because solar irradiance inhabits the same spectrum range as SIF, and is about 100X stronger. What is needed is a device that is able to monitor SIF while filtering out solar irradiance, while being autonomous and automatic. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Researchers at ORNL have developed a device that is capable of meeting this need. FAME (Fluorescence Auto-Measurement Equipment) monitors an area ranging in size from a single plant to an entire canopy, and is completely autonomous and automatic. FAME effectively monitors SIF while filtering out solar irradiance. FAME has a unique advantage in that it can simultaneously monitor any environmental factors that a researcher might need. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Applications for FAME range from crop management and yield forecast to forest water stress and fire risk analysis. FAME has been tested at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux site for 3 months, and the gathered data was of very high quality. FAME can be remotely accessed via its built-in communications system, and calibrations and data downloads can be done through this system. ORNL is seeking partners in the agricultural or environmental testing market that are actively engaged in producing photosynthesis measuring devices.</span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;"></span></p>

<p>DRAFT SPECIFICATION: In continuance of its plan to replace the capabilities of 13 Inland Construction Tenders (WLIC) and 18 River Buoy Tenders (WLR), the USCG is releasing a draft specification with drawings and project peculiar documents (PPD). All of the above are current versions and subject to change. The draft specification is for two mono-hull ship variants with a common after-body as the materiel solutions to replace the WLIC and WLR. While the draft specification is unclassified, parties interested in viewing it must request <em>explicit access</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">via the Federal Business Opportunities web site</span>. The USCG Contracting Officer will decide all requests for access.</p>
<p>MEETINGS WITH SHIPBUILDERS AND SHIP DESIGNERS: The WCC Program plans to attend the International WorkBoat Show in New Orleans, LA December 4-6, 2019. USCG representatives will take this opportunity to meet one-on-one with shipbuilder and ship design teams (i.e., shipyards with design capability or ship designers teamed with shipyards). To request a meeting during the International WorkBoat Show, click on the link below or copy and paste it into your internet browser. The deadline to request a meeting is November 11, 2019.</p>
<p>https://einvitations.afit.edu/inv/anim.cfm?i=472262&amp;k=0666400B7D55</p>
<p>Shipbuilder and ship design teams not able to meet during the International WorkBoat Show may request a phone conference or meeting in Washington, DC by emailing wcc@uscg.mil. Because of resource constraints, the USCG will meet one-on-one only with shipyards with design capability or ship designers teamed with shipyards.</p>
<p>The WCC program will also staff a booth during the International WorkBoat Show and will provide information about its mission needs, status, and desired fielding schedule during a presentation on Wednesday, December 4, 2019 from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. CT.

CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /> <br /> - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br /> - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br /> - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br /> - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br /> - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br /> - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
1.  General

Equipment Maintenance and Repair of Surgical/Dental instruments and equipment.  

2.  Background. 
The Veterans Affairs (VA) Spokane Healthcare System, Spokane, WA requires quarterly instrument and equipment sharpening, repair, and modification on surgical and dental instruments and procedure case carts.

The contractor shall provide all equipment, materials, and labor for the quarterly instrument sharpening and repair for surgical, podiatry, Clinics, CBOCs, and Dental Instruments kept in the care of the Mann-GrandstaffVAMC.

4. Specific Tasks.

The contractor shall perform onsite sharpening on scissors, nail clippers, osteotomes, chisels, bone cutting forceps, curettes, wire and pin cutters, rongeurs, elevators. The Contractor shall restore inserts on needle holders, check instruments to ensure they are in good working order, have no cracks, and perform deep surface cleaning. The Government estimates the number of instruments to be sharpened or repaired each quarter to be 1500. The agreement does not include maintenance or repair of items such as flexible or rigid scopes, dental handpieces, or other items that the original manufacturer either prohibits the sale of original equipment manufacturer parts, or that cleaning, and sterilization validations are considered invalid by the device manufacturer after third party repair.

In the event that an instrument item is found to be defective beyond the capabilities of the mobile service, or in the event an instrument requires repair or sharpening and cannot wait until the quarterly service period, it may become necessary for the government to ship items via a route to be determined to the Contractor for service or repair. 

The Contractor will be responsible for all shipping or freight charges incurred during transit. Contractor will diagnose the defective item and coordinate with the COR within 3 business day of receipt. At that time the Contractor will provide the COR with a description of the defect, repair options, and repair cost, as well as an estimated time of repair.

4.2 Task 4   Summary of Completed Instrument Maintenance and Repair

Please ensure that all prices, extended prices and total prices are checked and verified for accuracy.  DO NOT go two (2) digits beyond the decimal point.      <br />(4) In accordance with FAR Part 9, Contractor Qualifications, past performance information will be used to determine whether an offeror has a satisfactory performance record to determine whether the offeror is a responsible contractor eligible for contract award.<br />An offeror determined to have an unsatisfactory performance record will be determined non-responsible, therefore, the offeror will not be eligible for contract award.<br />In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>The Government has a right to retrieve additional past performance information through the Government's past performance databases, Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).</p>

Failure to RSVP by 10 October 2019 at 3:00 pm PST will result in no access to site visit on day of site visit.  Please e-mail rommel.delmundo@us.af.mil to RSVP for the site visit.</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>Award will be made to the Offeror whose Acceptable Technical Proposal represents the Best Value to the Government.  Best Value will be determined by the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable proposal.  Offers will be rated by technical acceptability and award will be made to the lowest priced offer.</p>
<p>(1) The evaluation team will evaluate each offer on its merits and assign one of the following ratings to each offer.</p>
<p><br /> <br />Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings</p>
<p>Rating	Description<br />Acceptable	Offer clearly meets the requirements of the Solicitation and the Requirements Description.<br />Unacceptable	Offer does not clearly meet the requirements of the Solicitation and the Requirements Description.</p>
<p>Price.  The Government shall conduct a price evaluation of all offers.  The Government will evaluate an offer by adding the total price for all CLINs.  The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair, reasonable and realistic price.  Evaluation of prices will determine if they are compatible with the scope of the effort, are not unbalanced and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.  It is expected that the competitive nature of this acquisition will drive price reasonableness and fairness; however, the Government reserves the right, if it deems appropriate, to make these determinations by means of one or more price analysis techniques.</p>
<p>a.	Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR Part 9.1, whose offer conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this RFQ) and is judged, based on the evaluation to represent the best value offer.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award 1 (one) contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p>While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>b. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>AMENDMENT 000001:</strong></p>
<p>Purpose of this amendment is to extend offer date, answer questions and revise Price Schedule.</p>
<p>1. We shall extend the response date from October 16, 2019 to October 18, 2019 and time remains the same at 4:00 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>2.1. Questions: Total volume listed case volumes on the RFQ does not match current usage of panels. Currently the total case volumes listed in this RFQ look to be significantly higher than the actually usage by this facility. Please see some examples below. <br />1.448485 NMIC-140 (Emerge), 25/pk - Qty. 1000 should be 40<br />2.448871 NMIC-300 (Emerge), 25/pk - Qty. 1000 should be 40<br />3.449036 PMIC Emerge (25 Panels/Case) - Qty. 800 should be 32</p>
<p>2.1 Answer: We will remove part number #448485 (NMIC-140 Emerge) from Price Schedule. <br />2.2 Answer: Quantity for part number #448871 will remain the same at 1,000/pk for the base and option years. <br />2.3 Answer: Quantity for part number #449036 will change from 800/pk to 500/pk for the base and option years.</p>
<p>** See attachment for revised Price Schedule.</p>
<p>3. Question: Can you provide the appropriate amount of tests you will be using per panel, which will help us provide the customer with the correct amount of ancillary items to complete tests? <br />Answer: Estimated quantities were provided on the Price Schedule.</p>
<p>4. Question: Understanding that by purchasing/creating this new reagent contract this customer will negate the current CPT contract for this site. <br />Answer: We will continue to order from current contract for supplies. <br />Question: Does the customer intent on canceling the current contract? <br />Answer: No, because this is a brand new firm/fixed price contract for supplies only. We already purchased the BD Phoenix equipment.</p>
<p>5. Question: As the Q&amp;A concludes very close to the bid submission date, would it be possible to get an extension on this bid? <br />Answer: We are going to extend response date to October 18, 2019 at 4PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>All other solicitation terms and conditions shall remain unchanged.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification #1:</span></strong>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong>
<div>Q1:  Is it possible for offerors to partner with U.S. government agencies (e.g. the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) on the RFP proposal?  Can a U.S. government entity serve as a subcontractor as part of a contractor team for this competed RFP?</div>
<p>A1:  USTDA can only fund work undertaken by another U.S. government agency where it has been pre-arranged and approved via an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) mechanism.  However, it is not possible for another U.S. government entity to directly bid on a USTDA grant-funded activity or serve as a subcontractor as part of an offeror's proposal for this RFP.</p>
<p>Q2: At the bottom of the RFP page 12 and top of page 13, there is a discussion regarding timing, which concludes draft results and "solid supporting information" must be available before November 2019.  Is this still accurate?  By what date in November?  By when do you anticipate making the award and selecting a contractor to perform this study?   If the date is no longer accurate, by when are the draft results needed?</p>
<p>A2:  The Grantee must submit a Letter of Guarantee (performance security) from a financial institution to the off-taker no later than December 3th 2019. Therefore, the Grantee is looking for solid supporting information on the CAPEX, energy production, revenue, OPEX and technical stability such that credible reference sources and procedures could be provided to support the assessment no later by the end of November 2019.  <br />It is the Grantee's understanding that one method for completing this high-level analysis by the end of November 2019 would be to conduct high-level analysis in parallel with the proposal preparation; another, more flexible option would be for the Offeror to provide preliminary results from high-level analysis to the Grantee after kick-off with final updates thereafter.</p>
<p>Q3. The following paragraph (page 13), states plant performance simulations should be conducted by two different sophisticated simulation programs, with one set run by an external party via subcontracting.  To confirm, this is a requirement for the current assignment, with both sets of simulations to be performed, one by an external party via subcontracting, under the $533K budget and timing as clarified in response to #1?<br /> <br />A3: The preferred process for plant performance simulation (that would lead to revenue and penalty fee calculation) is to conduct using at least different sophisticated simulation programs. One simulation program should be run by the Offeror. The additional simulation programs could be conducted by the Offeror or conducted by "other credible external parties so as to obtain unbiased results".  Both simulations should be included within the fixed price budget, whether conducted by the Offeror or a subcontractor.</p>

Question Received on Solicitation #36C25720Q0002
You say that the McAllen Out-Patient Clinic has a Headend Location at Room H-101. Have wires been pulled to this location?YES
 
Are you expecting all of the receivers to be installed in this room or are you wanting each receiver to be installed at the TV locations?  NO.  ONLY CLINIC THAT HAS CO-LOCATED RX IS CCOPC.

Based on the fact that you have asked for 19 channels, am I safe to assume that the two Harlingen sites have 19 receivers already installed at the headend location? 
If so, what receiver model number?  SEE ATTACHED PICTURES.

Since a headend location has not been specified for the Laredo Out-Patient Clinic, I am assuming that you want receivers installed at each TV.  A ROOM IS AVAILABLE FOR HEAD-END UNIT @ LOPC.  

The Corpus Christi and Laredo locations would be DirecTV private viewing accounts and the other three locations would be DirecTV lodging and institution services?  ALL SITES SHOULD/WOULD BE OF THE SAME TYPE OF ACCOUNT.   WOULD RATHER NOT INTERMINGLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACCOUNTS.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The effort will focus on the integration, validation, and demonstration of existing sensor technologies and assessment techniques, both Government-owned and commercial. This request is not intended to support development or maturation of specific sensor devices but instead integrate existing technologies and render the resulting data available and actionable. A non-exhaustive list of technologies that should be considered for integration follows.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Integration Platforms</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The hardware used to accomplish integration of multiple sensor devices must be self-contained, self-powered, and small and lightweight enough to easily integrate into the cockpit. Small form factor computing, including smartphone or tablet platforms, is desirable to enable minimal additional devices that must be integrated in aircrew ensembles. Wireless connectivity (such as BlueTooth Low Energy) is possible. Associated software design standards are expected to be Government provided, specifically the Cognitive Operations Gear Pack<sup>TM</sup> (COG Pack<sup>TM</sup>) architecture</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Call 004 (2-Step) - The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is issuing a call for white papers under the STAT BAA to solicit industry approaches for a Skyborg System Design Agent (SDA).
<p>The greater Skyborg program will directly support the initiatives outlined in the 2018 USAF Artificial Intelligence Strategy and the 2019 Executive Order of Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Air Force has committed to executing the appropriate transition plans across resources, missions, and organizations as technology development objectives are achieved.</p>
<p>This Skyborg SDA effort consists of incremental program phases that correspond to the overall program goals. A detailed description of the phased SDA statement of objectives is contained in a separate For Official Use Only (FOUO) Supplement to the call.</p>
<p>The objective of this call for white papers is to gauge industry interest, determine the industrial base, validate cost estimates, and solicit industry approaches to a software-centric SDA. After a review of the submitted white papers, the Skyborg program office plans to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to selected respondents as the second part of the call process. The USG anticipates one or more respondents will be notified to submit a proposal. However, the USG anticipates only one Skyborg SDA award in FY2020. Further details on the SDA concept can be found in Section I.2. of the call.</p>

<p>The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to manufacture this item. Firms interested in participating in this procurement are encouraged to contact the OEM, Honeywell Limited, CAGE 07217 to inquire about the data or rights to the data.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 855-3556. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 90 days after the issuance of this notice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">As such, the DON is considering opportunities to host the private development of resilient dispatchable generation and/or storage systems projects that would both sell to the public utility grid and provide some form of energy resiliency to the Navy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">With a focus on energy security and resilience, the DON expects to seek In-Kind Consideration (IKC) in lieu of cash rents from potential lease(s) in the form of electrical infrastructure upgrades or other proposed measures to increase the energy resilience posture of JBPHH.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the DON is seeking qualifications from past projects or existing technologies that employ a fast-switching and control design which, during a grid disruption, provides continuous access to reliable and quality power with islanding and black start capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The generation asset owner and utility enjoy mutual benefit of this design connection, which can reduce or eliminate curtailment with an available and islanded load during times of grid outage.</span></p>

<DESC><div><strong>GS-03F-0010R/EP-G14H-00900- On-site Audio Visual and Conference Facility Support</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Amendment to change from a twelve month extension to a six-month extension:<br /></strong></div>
<p><strong>Intent to Sole Source:</strong></p>
<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current GSA task order with One Diversified LLC, GS-03F-0010R/EP-G14H-00900, as described below.  The subject GSA task order expires on 11/18/2019.  The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award the follow-on services to this GSA task order in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules. Currently EPA is working on the competitive procurement to compete this requirement. However, the new award for follow-on services will not be awarded prior to the expiration date of order # GS-03F-0010R/EP-G14H-00900.  The services under this contract are critical and cannot lapse.  The EPA intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with One Diversified LLC, located at 2975 Northwoods Pkwy, Norcross, GA 30071. A modification will be done to the subject GSA task order to extend services for an additional six (6) months (11/19/2019 to 05/18/2020), until the follow-on order is awarded. During this potential six (6) month extension One Diversified LLC will continue to provide on-site audio visual and conference facility support to the EPA facility located at Potomac Yard.</p>
<p>One Diversified LLC is best suited for continuing to provide services and support for the requested potential six (6) month extension as they have the necessary personnel, and knowledge of the conference facility at EPA Potomac Yard already in place. Sole sourcing this critical requirement to One Diversified LLC will guarantee continuity of services for the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) while the Government completes the competition and award for the follow-on support services task order. Awarding this requirement to any other contractor at this time would lead to unacceptable delays and could lead to duplication of costs.</p>
<p>This extension to the subject GSA task order will ensure that OPP has continued audio visual and conference facility support. One Diversified LLC has been providing this support to the EPA Potomac Yard facility since 2014. They fully understand the technical work-arounds required to ensure proper connections at this EPA location that allow OPP to host continuous high visibility conferences, meetings, science advisory panels, and national workgroup meetings on a weekly basis.  The Government is not stating that there are no other contractors who can provide these services.  The Government is instead stating that considering the period of performance contemplated within this extension that no other contractor could provide these services without potentially hindering services, increasing costs, and creating unnecessary risks to the Government.  This potential six (6) month extension of services is not an attempt by the Government to limit competition to the incumbent contractor but to provide additional time for the award of a follow-on GSA task order. In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(C) - This requirement/extension is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) order that was placed in accordance with FSS ordering procedures. The EPA is committed to continuing the practice of increasing competition in an effort to select the most cost-effective solution in fulfilling the agency's operational goals. The EPA intends to issue a formal Request for Quote (RFQ) on GSA eBuy for this requirement that will be competed as a 100% small business set-aside in the near future.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the direction of the Government.</p>
<p>This notice will be posted for fifteen (15) days.</p>
<p>This intent of this synopsis is to state the Government's intention to sole source this requirement and to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via email to the Contracting Officer listed below within in fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.</p>
<p>At this time phone calls related to this notice of intent are not being accepted.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1 entitled - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements," the following information is herein documented regarding the non-competitive justification of the below-stated acquisition.<br />U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) intends to award a non-personal service contract to Dmitry Tischenko to serve as a Marketing Representative for Russian Federation and other designated countries. The term of the base agreement 1 November 2019 - 31 October 2020) with the option to extend for an additional (2) two-year periods. <br />The action being approved herein is a non-competitive procurement of services required to meet the Agency's need to place USAGM content on affiliate platforms in the region. The placement of this programming is vital to meet the ever-expanding requirements of the USAGM global broadcasting mission. <br />Mr. Tischenko has worked for BBG/IBB/OSD/USAGM since 2008. During this period, he has participated in USAGM marketing meetings where USAGM priorities and strategic goals were reviewed and discussed. He has promoted the VOA programs at seminars, fairs, and other settings, and also helped with miscellaneous advertising issues. He has monitored the programs and the media in Russian Federation region. He also assisted DC representatives during their travel through the region. Mr. Tischenko has helped to expand the USAGM reach in Russian Federation. During his time on the job, he has gained the experience to market USAGM programs and content in Russia, his large network of media and advertising contacts in this region is critical for the USAGM continued placement opportunities in the region. Dmitry has more than proved he is capable of doing the job. If his contract is not renewed, we run the risk of being handicapped by giving up the momentum we have established in this region. It is very difficult and expensive to send representatives from Washington, DC or from Prague, Czech Republic, to Russia to perform the marketing tasks that Mr. Tischenko handles, and he has both the language capabilities and the career network to get the job done. USAGM has compelling reasons to establish a new follow-on contract with Mr. Tiscehnko for another three years (base year plus (2) two year options to extend the contract term). <br />Per FAR Subpart 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) is the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition, and it is herein cited as follows: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from "Only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements", full and open competition need not be provided for.<br />The nature of the proposed acquisition requires these unique services to be provided by Dmitry Tischenko in order to ensure affiliate placement with existing affiliate broadcasters be maintained and current in-process affiliates be seen to fruition. USAGM herein certifies that Dmitry Tischenko is the only agent that can meet USAGM requirement.<br />The Contracting Officer, with the USAGM Authorizing Contracting Officer Representative (COR) for this procurement, has determined that the anticipated cost of the Government will be fair and reasonable.<br />This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotations or proposals. No solicitation is available. Candidates that believe they can provide equal or superior service that are capable of meeting government's needs are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a substantive statement with descriptive literature and any other supporting information to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of publication of this notice. All information received within 15 days of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government to determine if other candidate can meet the Government's requirements and is capable by the contracting office no later than deadline provided in this notice. Responses may be e-mailed to atgartne@usagm.gov. <br />Pursuant to Contract Subsection I.2 entitled, 52-232-18 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984), funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond 31 October 2020. The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond 30 October, 2017, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
