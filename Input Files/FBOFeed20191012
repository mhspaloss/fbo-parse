<DESC>This request for White Paper (RWP) is being issued to conduct research, development, and testing activities associated with Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) activities. This request meets the statutory requirements of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) (10 U.S.C. &sect;2371) for the prototype development and deployment of a DoD Enterprise Identity Service that will create a single user record, consolidating all pertinent data associated with the individual under one account, and automatically deleting such accounts when they are no longer required. The objective will be to establish a federated identity service for DISA, its mission partners, non-CAC holders (such as authorized guests and visitors), and non-person entities that mitigates current inefficiencies, facilitates strong authentication to current state-of-the-art cloud services, provide authorization services with role-base access, and enables audit of users and resources; using non-traditional defense contractor solutions per 10 USC &sect;2302(9).
