In support of the decision to use an International Agreement Competitive Restrictions (IACR) for these brand name requirements and to restrict competition to the brand names listed in lieu of a Justification and Approval (J&amp;A),&nbsp;ACC concluded that AFARS 5106.302-4 states that when citing the authority at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) as implemented in FAR 6.302-4 and DFARS 206.302-4(c), the IACR may be used to restrict competition to a brand name product(s), provided the agreement or treaty, or the written directions, contains sufficient information to explain why the use of other than competitive procedures is required - for example the citation of a specific brand and/or part number proprietary to a specific brand; and even in the absence of a sole source note on the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA), as is the case with both LOAs for this requirement; the IACR serves that purpose.</p>
<p>This requirement is in support of Security Assistance Management Directorate (SAMD) Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases IQ-B-ADU and IQ-B-ZCA for the Iraq Ministry of Defense. This is an FMS action via LOAs in accordance with DFARS 225.7302(1)(i), funded by FMS dollars. The scope includes: <br />a. System infrastructure design<br />b. Iraq Site surveys<br />c. Equipment purchases of all equipment requested<br />d. Installation and integration services in CONUS and Iraq<br />e. Conus engineering build and First Article Test (FAT)<br />f. Project Management/Systems Engineering Services<br />g. Information Assurance and Security Services<br />h. Maintenance Services<br />i. Help Desk Services<br />j.

The Government will evaluate and select, for contract award, two (2) or more qualified Offeror(s), whose Proposal(s) are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with consideration given to both the technical evaluation factors and price. <br /><br />Task Orders will primarily address new construction, design-build, general building renovation, road and pavement repair, utility work to include water, sewer, electrical and gas and general environmental work including, but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, and environmental remedial work.

There will be no limits on the number of task orders awarded/issued in any year; however, the minimum amount per task order issued against this contract is anticipated to be $50,000.00 and the maximum is anticipated not to exceed $5,000,000.00.

Notice of Future Solicitation
VHA Integrated Healthcare Transformation

The purpose of this Notice is to inform industry, including the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) community, that the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Procurement and Logistics, Strategic Acquisition Center- Frederick intends to soon release a solicitation for VHA Integrated Healthcare Transformation.
 
Background
VA previously released several Requests for Information and conducted an Industry Day related to a future requirement for VHA Integrated Healthcare Transformation (IHT). Based upon industry feedback, stakeholder input and associated refinements to the requirement, VA now anticipates release of a solicitation in August 2019.

Purpose
This requirement will support the needs of VHA program offices, specifically the Office of Healthcare Transformation (OHT) and its customers to best accomplish VHA s mission and strategic goals, priorities and initiatives. This work will be complex and agile and will be best supported through expert healthcare contractors providing critical market-based healthcare industry skills that augment the internal activities of the VHA program offices. This acquisition, referred to as Veteran Healthcare Administration Integrated Healthcare Transformation (VHA IHT), will provide a vehicle for a broad range of general management and business services and solutions in the broad health care environment.  The functional categories (FCs) will include: FC 1: Health System Transformation and Innovation, FC 2: Implementation and Operations Support and FC 3:  Specialized Health Systems Functions (previous  service groups  consolidated and categorized within these three primary categories).

VHA IHT will provide best value healthcare and professional consulting services to VHA through a pool of highly qualified Veteran Integrated contractor Teams (VITs). The resulting acquisition vehicle is intended to be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This acquisition solution balances VA s obligation to provide to our Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) direct contracting opportunities and the VHA National Program need to obtain maximum value from healthcare related professional service expenditures. Opportunities for SDVOSBs are provided through set-aside IDIQ award(s) to Integrated Teams led by SDVOSBs serving as Veteran Integrated Team Agile Leads (VITAL), and SDVOSB teaming partners serving as VIT Eligible Partners (VITEPs). VHA National Programs will recognize maximum value from healthcare related professional service expenditures through integrated support crossing various Functional Categories, access to national healthcare consulting VIT Partners, and Team Partners with expert knowledge in any of the identified Functional Categories. Additional benefits include a vehicle that is focused on efficiency with streamlined ordering procedures and reduced procurement lead times.

Task orders against this IDIQ contract will require contractor support for vast and complex healthcare programs and projects. VHA healthcare is a complex integrated system that must transform in response to both the changing needs of the Veteran population and changes in the healthcare industry. These shifts create challenges and require collaboration (internal and external partnerships) as well as new and innovative approaches to healthcare and healthcare delivery. The programs and projects will require diverse healthcare operations knowledge and experience.  Subject matter expertise could be required to be rapidly available to provide national support under a potential task order including, but not limited to, the following areas: high reliability organization, electronic health records management, healthcare modernization and transformation (to include integration of artificial intelligence solutions and disruptive models), financial management business transformation in a healthcare setting, healthcare human resources (to include credentialing, privileging and licensing), healthcare regulatory compliance, healthcare analytics, mental health and suicide prevention, access to care, and population health. All work will support various areas under VHAs business functional framework.

Requirements of this PWS and future task orders will require highly complex healthcare experience. Highly complex healthcare requirements may include the involvement of multiple Functional Categories and several program offices and/or departments e.g. DOD and VHA.  Healthcare consists of the continuum of care and services that include but are not limited to: operations, management, and planning of diagnostic, preventative, remedial, therapeutic services in inpatient, outpatient, and telemedicine settings. Healthcare requirements may also include other activities such as management support of supply chain i.e. medical equipment, pharmacy services, healthcare claims processing and benefits administration. The scope of these requirements will also include the integration and management of various interrelated workstreams for a strategic, resource intensive, time constrained projects. 

Next Steps
Interested firms (SVOSBs, other socio-economic categories and other than small businesses looking to play a role as VIT team members) are advised to monitor FBO for the solicitation, and to follow any included guidance/instructions included within the solicitation. This requirement will be a 100% SDVOSB set-aside, but fully mission capable VITs will likely require participation from the best firms within the gamut of socio-economic categories as well as leaders in private health care consulting.

Additional Information

Joint Ventures

VIP Verified SDBOSBs considering submission as prospective VITALs may do so independently or as part of a Joint Venture (JV). For the VITAL assessment of the advisory phase (Phase I), the Government anticipates considering work done individually by each partner to the JV, and previous work of the JV itself; however, given the tremendously important responsibilities assigned to the SDVOSB in contracts awarded to a JV, the relative experience of the SDVOSB partner to the JV may receive greater consideration/scrutiny given the significant predictive value in ensuring the experience of the SDVOSB integrating and managing large complex healthcare requirements is adequately considered. Limiting the amount of experience that may be credited to the non-SDVOSB partner (amount TBD) ensures meaningful consideration of the experience of the SDVOSB member of the JV.

During the Advisory Phase (Phase I), prospective JVs may be provided a conditional advisement letter indicating viability as VITAL subject to CVE verification. To be eligible to serve in the VITAL role, the JV must be a separate legal entity verified as an SDVOSB, prior to the date established for receipt of Phase II proposals (formal team submission), and must have  carr(ied) out no more than three specific or limited-purpose business ventures for joint profit over a two year period.  If not already formed and verified, prospective JVs are therefore encouraged to start the JV verification process now to maximize the potential that CVE will have the opportunity to process the verification application in time. The Contracting Officer does not intend to intervene in the CVE verification process and cannot guarantee expedited processing of applications.

See the attached CVE Verification Assistance Brief Understanding Joint Venture and Mentor Protg Eligibility for an overview and eligibility requirements. Questions regarding CVE process and additional details on verification eligibility should contact VA OSDBU/CVE.

Contract Teaming Arrangements

Contract Teaming Arrangements (CTAs) may be desirable from a Government and industry standpoint to enable companies involved to (1) complement each other s unique capabilities and (2) offer the Government the best combination of performance, cost, and delivery for the system or product being acquired. VITs will be fundamentally built upon formal CTAs.

The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) defines a CTA as  [A]n arrangement in which--(1) Two or more companies form a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential prime contractor; or (2) A potential prime contractor agrees with one or more other companies to have them act as its subcontractors under a specified Government contract or acquisition program.  For the IHT requirement, a joint venture CTA may be used to fill the VITAL role as described above. The second described CTA, prime contractor agreement with subcontractors, will be necessary to ensure robust, fully mission capable teams comprised of the prime (VITAL) and complementing VITEPs and VIT Subcontract-Only (VITSO) partners.

Upon receipt of assessment results (Phase I), prospective VITALs will establish CTAs with those firms necessary to build the best possible team positioned to support any and all IHT task orders. Prospective VITALs should now be conducting the early dialog necessary to ensure CTAs in place prior to the date established for receipt of Phase II proposals (formal team submission).

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Project Manager Expeditionary Energy and Sustainment System (PM E2S2) formerly known as PM Mobile Electric Power (PM MEP) has been a leader in developing, fielding and servicing power generation and power distribution for U.S. Army applications and is currently conducting market research in support of the Power Distribution Illumination System Electrical (PDISE) program. The legacy PDISE family includes the M200, M100, M40 three phase feeder/ distribution systems, M60 single phase distribution system and M46 electrical utility assembly. The current Medium Power Distribution Systems (MPDS) includes the legacy PDISE plus the AMMPS Microgrid Kit and Power Plant Switch Boxes.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is seeking sources for power distribution equipment, on behalf of PM MEPS. These sources shall have the capability to manufacture, test, and deliver power distribution equipment used by the US Army. This equipment includes standalone or skid mounted ruggedized power distribution systems, associated cables assembly and accessories. The equipment and end items are capable, singularly or in combination with each other, of being connected directly to generator sets ranging from 5kW through 200kW.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources who have the capability to effectively interpret detailed Government specifications and product drawings. In addition, potential sources must have the capability to assemble the equipment and conduct production conformance tests such as MIL-STD-705, Department of Defense Test Method Standard Mobile Electric Power Systems Revision D, 22 November 2016. The estimated quantity of power distribution equipment to be procured is projected to be around 760 over a production period from fiscal year 2020 through 2025 with an average delivery rate of approximately 12 per month which may peak at 30 per month.</p>
<p>The contract is expected to be a five-year, Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) or Requirement type contract using Government furnished Technical Data Packages (TDPs). These TDPs include both specifications and drawings which describe the details, performance, and conformance testing of this equipment. The respective TDPs are available upon request for products listed in Table 1.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT(S):</p>
<p>MPDS</p>
<p>MPDS are man-portable feeder/distribution equipment that enables the transfer of electricity from military generator sets to DoD materiel.</p>
<p>AMMPS Microgrid kits: AMMPS Microgrid is designed to automatically start and stop up to six AMMPS generator sets (30kW or 60kW) in pairs of two based on power demand. The AMMPS Microgrid kit includes all components necessary to build an AMMPS Microgrid except for the Advanced Digital Control System (ADCS). The key components of the Microgrid Kit are the Microgrid Feeder Box (MFB) for the kit (04-50051), Parallel Communication Interconnect (PCI) Box and associated cable assemblies.</p>
<p>M200: The M200 is 120/208V, three phase, Electrical Feeder System. It has one (1) three-phase, 200A input circuit with three (3) 100A, four (4) 60A and one (1) 20A output circuits. The system also includes a pigtail and feeder cables.</p>
<p>M100: The M100 is 120/208V, three phase, Electrical Feeder System. It has one (1) three-phase, 100A input circuit with one (1) 100A feed-through; two (2) 60A, two (2) 40A and two (2) 20A output circuits. The system also includes a pigtail and feeder cables.</p>
<p>M40: The M40 is 120/208V, three phase, Electrical Distribution System. It has one (1) three-phase 40A input circuit with one (1) feed-through; and twelve (12) 20A, single-phase output circuits. The system includes a pigtail, distribution cables, extension cables, Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) cables, and household type, duplex receptacle.</p>
<p>M60: The M60 is 120V, single- phase, Electrical Distribution System. It has one (1) 60A input/output circuit with six (6) 20A output circuits. The system includes a pigtail, distribution cables, extension cables, GFCI cables, and household type, duplex receptacle.</p>
<p>M46: The M46 Utility Assembly is similar to wall outlets in a fixed facility. The M46 comes in a transit container that contains branch circuit assembly, cables, lights, and standard household type 120 VAC duplex receptacles for plugging the electrical load. It could be emplaced within tents, shelters or building.</p>
<p>Switch Box Equipment for 5-60kW AMMPS Power Plant (PP):</p>
<p>An Advanced Medium Mobile Power Source (AMMPS) Power Plant (PP) is a trailer mounted generator set configuration consisting of two generator sets, one or two trailers, a switch box and power cables which enable the Warfighter to have redundant power capability. The AMMPS PP range in size from 5 to 60kW using 5 different switch boxes described in Table 1. The Switch Box is connected between two AMMPS sets by paralleling assemblies. The Switch Box enables no break in power when changing power sources for maintenance.</p>

<CONTACT>John Rider, Acquisition Support Analyst, Email john.c.rider.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Product Manager for Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PdM-SCIE), located at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) to potentially fill an operational need and seeks to identify domestic products, suppliers, and manufacturers (reference Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.225-1) of a tailorable law enforcement load carriage system for the Military Police (MP) Corps and Law Enforcement (LE) community. The LEEK consolidation of the following equipment establishes unified standards for equipping, training, and sustaining the Army MP Corps - and potentially our Sister Services' (military police) equivalent units. PdM SCIE has the responsibility to maintain, develop, and improve Soldier clothing and individual equipment to include law enforcement equipment as the life cycle manager of these items. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with expected instructions for the submission of responses to this RFI.
<p>Should PdM SCIE procure items for an evaluation and/or purchases for a future requirement, a Law Enforcement Ensemble Kit/System would potentially include the following items:</p>
<p>&bull; Load Carriage System (Belt)<br />&bull; Load Carriage System Stays<br />&bull; Handcuff Pouch<br />&bull; Surgical Glove Pouch<br />&bull; Pepper Spray Pouch<br />&bull; Flashlight<br />&bull; Flashlight Holder<br />&bull; Double Magazine Pouch</p>
<p>Salient characteristics:</p>

<p>Rationale: Soldiers operating in a variety of situations/environments will need the ability to adjust the fit of the system based on uniforms, weather conditions and added equipment. This provides a degree of flexibility for Soldiers of different physical attributes to acquire proper form, fit, and function. *(MHH - to include magazines pouches, and the electronic discharge weapon are separate programs of record and will be issued to Soldiers/MPs accordingly).</p>
<p>2) The LEEK shall be tailorable in design and allow for attachment or detachment of Law Enforcement Load Carriage components to a base foundation.</p>
<p>Rationale: MP's require a modular, scalable, mission-tailorable system that is lightweight and easily configurable. MP's can add, move, or remove equipment as needed.</p>
<p>3) All components and end items of the LEEK must provide a minimum service life of 365 cumulative days of field use and shelf life of 5 years.</p>
<p>4) The LEEK must not hinder a Soldier's ability to carry or operate protective equipment, entrance and exit from motor vehicles, or carry out day-to-day missions. The LEEK must be compatible with current and future Army load bearing equipment. The LEEK must function when used and stored in the same climatic conditions as the current MP and LE equipment.</p>
<p>5) The LEEK shall not present a health hazard to the Soldier and shall contain no health hazards, or Toxic Industrial Chemical (TICs)/Toxic Industrial Material (TIMs).</p>
<p>6) The components of the LEEK shall weigh less than 5 pounds (T); 2 pounds (O) when dry.</p>
<p>7) The LEEK components will be black in color. (There is no requirement for a "tactical" variant of the LEEK that matches or blends in with the Army Combat Uniform).</p>
<p>8) The Load Carriage System Stays shall be designed to hold equipment (handcuffs, surgical gloves, flashlights, batons, pepper spray, handheld radios, electronic discharge weapons, load carriage system stays) in place and close to the Law Enforcement Load Carriage System.</p>
<p>9) The LEEK components i.e. load carrier system (belt), handcuff case, surgical gloves' case, flashlight, flashlight case, radio pouch, and pepper spray pouch must be capable of being moved/removed without causing interference with the wear and use of the LEEK.</p>
<p>10) The LEEK shall have a handcuff pouch designed to hold the handcuffs currently being issued to the Military Police (weight and size). Designed to be pliable to conform to the body. Closure shall be designed to retain handcuffs yet be accessible to the wearer.</p>
<p>11) The LEEK shall provide a Surgical Glove Pouch designed to be compartmentalized to securely hold two (2) sets of surgical gloves (T); 3 pairs of gloves (O). Designed to be pliable to conform to the body. Closure shall be designed to retain surgical gloves yet be accessible to the wearer.</p>
<p>12) The LEEK shall provide an impact resistant flashlight. Must be drop safe from 5 feet. Must provide a non-slip grip.

<CONTACT>Ceseley Dunbar, Contract Specialist, Phone 7578742434, Email ceseley.dunbar@nasa.gov
<DESC>This sources sought seeks technical capabilities and innovative ideas from industry for potential participation in a proposal development activity that addresses the technical objectives and development of a Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) IV sensorcraft (i.e., a highly integrated instrument and small spacecraft) in response to an anticipated Earth Venture (Mission/Instrument) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) expected to be released in the next 1-6 months.
<p>BACKGROUND<br /><br />SAGE IV intends to take advantage of advancements in small satellite technologies to demonstrate the ability to match or exceed the measurements of the SAGE III payload (1.15 m3 volume, 329 kg mass, currently operating on ISS) in a 6U CubeSat form factor. Beyond this demonstration, the eventual goal is to deploy a constellation of four or more SAGE IV CubeSats for continuous monitoring of atmospheric aerosols, ozone, and other important constituents, and extensibility of the SAGE IV measurement concept to other planetary atmospheres will also be explored.</p>
<p>Earth Venture is a program element within the Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP) program consisting of a series (e.g., Mission, Instrument, and Continuity AOs) of innovative, integrated, science-driven approaches to pressing Earth system science issues. The goal of NASA's Earth Venture mission portfolio is to provide frequent flight opportunities for high-quality, high-value, focused Earth science investigations that can be accomplished under a not-to-exceed cost cap and that can be developed and flown relatively quickly, generally in 4-5 years or less. For additional information on the Venture Class program, visit the ESSP website at https://essp.nasa.gov/.</p>
<p>Earth Venture proposed investigations will be evaluated and selected through a single-step competitive process. This single step is the solicitation, submission, evaluation, and selection of proposals prepared in response to an AO. NASA Headquarters intends to select at least one mission or instrument to proceed to development for flight and operations as the outcome of this process. The SAGE IV concept is expected to be classified as a "Class D" small satellite mission with higher risk posture that is cost-capped at ~$30M.</p>
<p>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking to lead in developing a proposal addressing the goals and objectives of Earth Venture, specifically focusing on the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) IV concept. This sources sought is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. Government Agencies. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other Minority Universities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses, and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply. Participation by non-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASA's policy of no exchange of funds, in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs.<br />TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The technology focus of this sources sought is to finalize the current LaRC design and the subsequent assembly, integration, and testing (AI&amp;T) necessary to implement a constellation of low-cost, Low Earth Orbit, atmospheric occultation sensorcraft that meet or exceed the retrieval capabilities of SAGE II. The goal of this effort is to sustainably meet NASA's ongoing mandate to monitor ozone in the atmosphere and to provide data continuity for critical stratospheric aerosol measurements while simultaneously advancing the state of the art, overcoming the geographic sampling limitations of the SAGE series of heritage instruments, and preserving the continuity of the SAGE data products. This requires observing the solar disk during sunrise and sunset occultation events in spectral channels that range between the ultraviolet and infrared. A SAGE IV Pathfinder ground demonstration prototype was developed during a NASA-funded Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) effort. The IIP developed a flight concept and demonstrated a design that would satisfy requirements for a flight mission given certain performance requirements on flight detector and electronics as well as the spacecraft bus itself. As such, this sources sought primarily seeks out vendors that can provide the detector, the spacecraft bus, and/or AI&amp;T services both for the instrument into the spacecraft as well as AI&amp;T for the instrument itself.</p>
<p>NASA LaRC is seeking input from industry and industry teams that have experience in the capabilities outlined below:</p>
<p>A) Deliver Focal Plane Detector: The SAGE IV instrument will require a COTS space flight quality 2D PIN diode array with square pixels that should not exceed 35 &micro;m pitch, active area no smaller than 4 mm &times; 4 mm, and total focal plane assembly package size (excluding external focal plane electronics or harnessing but including hybridized control and data acquisition circuits such as an analog or digital readout integrated circuit) not greater than 50 mm &times; 48 mm &times; 20 mm. Additionally, the project seeks full potential well density &ge; 5000 electrons/&micro;m2, spectral sensitivity between ~350 nm and ~1050 nm (i.e., silicon responsivity spectrum), programmable integration time enabling time stepping between at least ~0.5 ms and ~20 ms, at least 12-bit readout electronics, and full frame readout rate of at least 20 Hz. Active temperature control being necessary for SAGE IV focal plane array temperature stability (desired stable to about &plusmn; 0.1 &deg;C at about 10 &deg;C in Low Earth Orbit), the project will require either an integrated (non-cryo cooled) active thermal control system or available surface area on the back side of the focal plane assembly for government bonding of a government-supplied thermoelectric cooler system. The typical detector element should be linear to at least 1% ideally between 1% and 85% of full well capacity, have dark current ideally at or below 0.5% of full well capacity at 10 &deg;C and 10 ms integration time, and exhibit read noise ideally at or below 0.02% of full well capacity. Vendors responding to this space flight detector capability shall also specify expected pixel yield per unit and first time yield (FTY) per run statistics, manufacturing process (e.g., flip chip bump bonding, polymer adhesive, or direct bonding), details of available development focal plane electronics, details of readout windowing capabilities, power dissipation, and expected figures of merit for both the detector (including but not limited to well capacity, relative spectral response, quantum efficiency, readout noise, detector flat field response, noise-equivalent power, and mean linearity and adjacent crosstalk percentage/MTF) and ROIC (including but not limited to integration efficiency, system gain, fixed pattern noise potential, quantization step equivalents, effective number of bits, and bit error rate, as applicable). ROM costing and schedule for delivery of 5, 10, or 20 space flight ready focal plane assemblies, end-item data packages including electrical and mechanical interface documents, drawings, and vendor test reports supporting performance requirements, and as applicable external focal plane electronics and harnessing shall be provided by vendors responding to this capability.<br />B) Deliver Spacecraft Buses: The SAGE IV project will require space flight quality CubeSat or small satellite spacecraft buses including structures and trusses for a likely 6U form factor (12U backup options also welcome) equipped with a solar panel electrical power system with &gt;75 W power available to the instrument and absolute attitude and determination control system (ADCS) that enables &lt; 5 arcminute absolute pointing accuracy. The bus must support at least 4U of government provided payload configured to the CubeSat form factor. The bus must accept real-time ADCS attitude commanding from the internal science payload (as its imager centroids its radiometric target) and be capable of a slew rate with respect to inertial space of 1.5&deg;/sec for an ideally 6 kg total package. The bus should provide GPS time, GPS PPS, and GPS ephemeris to the internal science payload, offer command and data handling systems including onboard data storage and downlink (aggregate data volume of ~1 Gigabytes per day), and enable timely transmission of health and status of the instrument and spacecraft (e.g., Global Star). The respondent should have the capability for AI&amp;T of a completed flight instrument into the spacecraft bus, have capability for orbit thermal modeling to design mission critical thermal control surfaces, have the ability to process space flight hardware and cite a contamination control plan, and be able to provide mission operations support. ROM costing and schedule provided should include all itemized AI&amp;T services offered as well as the delivery of a bus simulator engineering development unit early in the project cycle, delivery of 1, 2, or 4 space flight ready spacecraft buses, all offered end-item data packages including electrical and mechanical interface documents, drawings and schematics, and vendor test reports supporting performance requirements.<br />C) Instrument Design and AI&amp;T: The SAGE IV project is seeking respondents with the ability to provide engineering design and AI&amp;T services. The respondent should have the ability to work closely with NASA and other vendors to provide support in mechanical, structural, electrical, thermal, systems, and/or optical engineering to mature the laboratory SAGE IV Pathfinder design to a spaceflight ready instrument. The respondent should indicate any capacity to work closely with NASA and other vendors to support subsequent subsystem, system, and spacecraft level AI&amp;T, including environmental testing and spacecraft maneuver and conops testing.</p>
<p>Hardware should be a higher Technology Readiness Level (TRL) that is essentially "spaceflight ready." Earth Venture requires demonstration of TRL 6 by the Preliminary Design Review, where TRL 6 is roughly defined by a "system/subsystem model or prototyping demonstration in a relevant end-to-end environment (ground or space)." Since this is intended for a small spacecraft with a limited form factor (e.g., a 6U or 12U CubeSat), minimization of volume needs to be considered. AI&amp;T services should have a demonstrated history of success working with spaceflight missions.<br />INFORMATION REQUESTED</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to submit a capabilities statement detailing the ability to meet the requirements listed below.</p>
<p>1) Technical Capability: This criterion assesses the technical capabilities required for the performance of the development activity described herein with emphasis on the instrument components listed and sensorcraft AI&amp;T. Assessment will be made of the respondent's technical capability to build or complete similar spaceflight hardware or tasks, including but not limited to: (a) the respondent's ability to develop successful plans for meeting defined instrument and testing requirements, (b) the ability to deliver space flight hardware, and (c) the availability of key personnel skilled in similar space hardware and tasks. <br />2) Payload Accommodation: This criterion assesses the understanding of accommodating optical payloads. [Applicable to (B) and (C) only].<br />3) Facilities: This criterion assesses the respondent's facilities (e.g., clean room, fabrication, benchtop development, small spacecraft mass moments and attitude determination and control testing, and environmental and optical testing facilities, as well as mission/quality assurance and analysis/modeling capabilities as applicable). <br />4) Cost and Schedule Control: This criterion assesses the cost and schedule estimate for the space technology solution being offered. The cost and schedule management strategies for hardware development and delivery should be discussed, as applicable. Provide the cost and schedule drivers and assumptions, as applicable.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

BACKGROUND AND SYNOPSIS.

The Department of Veterans Affairs has been providing direct and specialized services for homeless Veterans for over 25 years. The Secretary of the VA has set a zero-tolerance policy for homelessness within the Veteran population since 2009.  The plan to end homelessness among Veterans includes planned increases to the capacity of existing programs and an increase in services offered to Veterans. New models of care not previously offered by VHA are also being implemented.

The intent of this contract is for the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare System (VAGLAHS) Healthcare for Homeless Veteran program to engage a community provider to offer homeless Veterans Contracted Residential Services.

Veterans are referred to the contractor by VAGLAHS staff or other community agencies based on a demonstrated need for case management and supportive services to stabilize mental health, substance abuse, medical and/or other co-occurring serious psychosocial issues before expediently being placed in secure and permanent housing. The VAGLAHS Healthcare for Homeless Veterans program seeks Veterans currently engaged in care through a collaborative partnership among the VAGLAHS, the Los Angeles Coordinated Entry System Service Providers, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, and other Veteran-specific programs that serve homeless Veterans. Veterans may access transitional housing programs directly and through referrals in the community. Prioritization for Veterans in need of care is as follows:

 Priority Group 1: Veterans who enter the program who have an identified housing plan such as receipt of a HUD-VASH voucher or receipt of Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) services.

 Priority Group 2:  Veterans experiencing chronic homelessness with a Vulnerability Index Score above 10 and have initially been connected to VA housing services for care.

 Priority Group 3: Veterans who report homelessness and seek temporary supportive services before entering a permanent housing plan.

GENERAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS.

The Contractor shall rapidly house Veterans requiring residential services and treatment at the VAGLAHS, addressing mental health, physical health, substance abuse and other psychosocial problems. Ultimately, the goal is for Veterans to obtain permanent housing within 180 days. The contractor shall provide residential services as described in this PWS in a temporary facility located on the campus of the VAGLAHS medical center. The contractor shall not be required to pay rent for the use of this temporary facility, however, the Contractor shall furnish the temporary facility and provide the services required by this PWS twenty-four hours per day, every day of the year as stated herein. 

The contractor shall provide services for up to 100 Veterans who may be of the following eligible homeless Veteran populations:

Males  

 Veterans over the age of 55;

 Veterans considered priority such as Post 9/11 Veterans with acutely elevated suicide risk factors.

A VAGLAHS Liaison to the contractor shall act as the clinical liaison between the Contractor and VAGLAHS.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. A temporary housing facility shall be provided by the VAGLAHS on the campus of the VAGLAHS medical center located at 11301 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90073.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Sources Sought Number: HHS-NIH-OD-OLAO-SS-20-001</span></strong> <br /><br />This is a <strong>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</strong>. It is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this notice is for market research purposes and will be used to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform the potential requirement described herein in the statement of work.
<p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Data Science Summer Fellows Program for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of ALL small business concerns to provide services to the Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS) in its role as NIH's coordinator of data and computer science-related activities across all 27 NIH Institutes and Centers. NIH's mission is "to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability". In implementing that mission, NIH conducts research in its own laboratories, supports research of non-Federal scientists at universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout United States and overseas, helps train research investigators, and fosters communication of medical information.</p>
<p>As part of its central coordinating role, NIH ODSS is seeking capable student interns with expertise in computer and data science and related fields to join offices across NIH for the summer and contribute to the unique missions and data science needs of each interested NIH office.</p>
<p>Through an established fellowship program that strives to expose computational students to public service opportunities at many federal agencies across the Washington, DC area, ODSS seeks the expertise of an organization specializing in and partnering with other organizations that are experts in student summer programs to manage the recruitment, application, review, and selection processes, and to facilitate matching NIH offices with interns with skills in data research, data science, product management, and software design/engineering. Interns will provide customer/user-centered research, prototypes, and evidence-based recommendations for the analyses of datasets, design of new tools, and development of other products.</p>
<p><strong>Objective of this Procurement:</strong></p>
<p>Through an established fellowship program that strives to expose computational students to public service opportunities at many federal agencies across the Washington, DC area, ODSS seeks the expertise of an organization specializing in and partnering with other organizations that are experts in student summer programs to manage the recruitment, application, review, and selection processes, and to facilitate matching NIH offices with interns with skills in data research, data science, product management, and software design/engineering. Interns will provide customer/user-centered research, prototypes, and evidence-based recommendations for the analyses of datasets, design of new tools, and development of other products.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities of the Contractor:</strong></p>
<p>The contractor is responsible for recruiting and hiring up to 50 candidates, providing logistical support of travel to/from Bethesda, MD and short-term housing for student interns, managing and implementing payroll, mitigating any work-related issues with the student interns (together with NIH), and generally overseeing the student interns. The contractor is expected to manage intern/employer issues as they arise and work with the COR if staffing changes or early termination are needed. The selected student interns will serve as fellows for NIH for a 10-week duration with the expectation that they work primarily onsite in the Bethesda/Rockville vicinity. The student interns shall be able to work 40 hours per week for the duration of the 10-week program and at the time of applying to the fellowship (e.g., the winter prior) shall be currently enrolled in an accredited higher education institution. The contractor or its partners should also provide training opportunities and support for the fellows; for example, regular professional development opportunities and mentors not affiliated with the NIH office in which a fellow is placed. Mentors should be local to the area and have expertise in computational and data-related fields.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities of the Government:</strong></p>
<p>The Government will provide furnished office workspace, computers, printers, and other material items needed to perform the services required by the task orders each host office develops. The government will also coordinate an NIH orientation session for the selected student interns, schedule intermittent meetings to share information and discuss projects, and organize a forum at the end of the session for interns to present a final report (in the form of a PowerPoint or a poster). The government will also provide central mentorship, as well as mentorship at the level of each office.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Required Services:</strong></p>
<p>1. Student Outreach and Recruitment</p>
<p>NIH is seeking student interns with skills in data research, data science, product management, software design and engineering, and/or database engineering. Interns will provide customer/user-centered research, prototypes, and evidence-based recommendations for the analyses of datasets, design of new tools, and development of other products. To recruit students with this expertise, the contractor is expected to work with partners as needed and have a vast and diverse network outside the biomedical research space. The contractor and/or partners must have mechanisms and a plan in place for reaching to and beyond that network to bring in the best diverse talent. An established, competitive program with track records for recruiting talented individuals is desired.</p>
<p>2. Application Receipt, Processing, and Evaluation System</p>
<p>The contractor shall have in place a process to solicit and receive applications safely and securely, process the applications to determine if students meet minimal requirements and possess several of the additional desired qualifications (both listed below), and evaluate the interns based on their qualifications and the needs of the agency. NIH expects that the contractor has a tested process in place to internally rank, select, match interns with skills and experience most appropriate for the task orders put forth by the NIH host offices, which will be communicated by the COR following award.</p>
<p><strong>Required Staffing Qualifications:</strong> <br /><br />The contractor must identify interns that meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Are U.S. Citizens<br />&bull; Are enrolled full-time in an accredited institution of higher learning, or graduate no earlier than Winter quarter/semester prior to the summer of matriculation at NIH <br />&bull; Are able to start the fellowship in Bethesda/Rockville, MD at the start date agreed upon by contractor and NIH <br />&bull; Have completed at least one technical internship, work experience, or project<br />&bull; Have been previously involved in the "tech for good" space (e.g., leader of a campus club, volunteer in local communities, or contributor to open-source projects)</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The period of performance is expected to be for one twelve-month base period and four twelve-month option periods, anticipated to awarded by December 1st, 2019.</p>

The DUs currently utilized within the E-6B CDS are facing increasing parts obsolescence, which necessitates the fielding of a suitable substitute Display Unit identified as part number 4091900-942. However, the existing legacy model DEU is not compatible with the alternate DU model. The Navy therefore desires to upgrade the legacy DEU inventory to enable simultaneous operation of both legacy and alternate DU models within the E-6B CDS. The Navy plans to upgrade approximately 55 DEUs. The offeror should also propose their plan to provide engineering, logistics, and repair support packages.</span></p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to issue a solicitation for a sole source, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract with Decathalon Development Corporation (DDC) in support of software development and maintenance for the continued operation of Integrated Budget, Planning and Execution System (IBPES) in a Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) environment.  A draft Statement of Work is attached.  Of specific importance is the ability to build and support the interface of IBPES with the NMCI network via technical support that includes developing, testing, creating, and running scripts for report generation compatible with Navy/NSWCDD ERP interfaces.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited in accordance with the authority of 10 U.S. C 2304 (c) (1) and FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source".</p>
<p>DDC has developed, tested, created and run scripts under its existing proprietary Application Server (AS) software, which interfaces the IBPES system with NMCI allowing for web browser application capability and report formatting and generation.  IBPES is not accessible on the NMCI network without DDC's AS software.   No other Contractor retains a currently developed line of scripts that are Department of the Navy Application and Database Management System (DADMS) approved and interfaces IBPES with NMCI.  Additionally, procuring from another Contractor would require, at a minimum, development, validation, verification, and implementation of approximately 250 scripts as well as provide a developed, tested and DADMS approved middle tier AS which would allow for IBPES and NMCI functionality, resulting in duplication of cost and effort and a lapse in coverage during the period of script development, testing, and creation that would be unacceptable and detrimental to NSWCDD's ability to support the Navy.</p>
<p>The contract will include a one year base period and four one year option periods.  The period of performance is anticipated to be for a total length of sixty (60) months. Responsible sources may identify their interest and capability which shall be considered by the agency. Capability statements shall address:</p>
<p>-Technical capability to perform the tasking;<br />-Length of time it would take to develop, test, create, and then successfully run the scripts required to interface IBPES within NMCI networks;<br />-Length of time the system interface would be down, and;<br />-Documentation demonstrating the Contractor's proposed system can meet the requirements to be DADMS approved</p>
<p>This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals.   A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is a Sources Sought and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the U.S. Navy to procure the subject services.</p>
<p>Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact DDC directly.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or around 30 April 2020 and will be open for 30 days.  Contract award is anticipated approximately around 31 December 2020.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this Sources Sought synopsis should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Daniel Belcher, at Daniel.belcher@navy.mil.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Background: </strong>CNIC Fleet and Family Readiness Training possesses, as part of a license in perpetuity purchase from AchieveGlobal, 30 Genuine Leadership and Customer Service e-learning modules for various leadership and customer service topics. These e-learning modules are packaged for deployment using a SCORM 1.2 model, and utilize Flash-based interactive elements and content. Due to the end-of-life of Adobe Flash software, and the training industry's move to HTML 5 compliance for e-learning module development, these 30 existing e-learning publication modules will be non-functional in current and future Internet browser platforms (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari), which no longer support Flash-based functionality in web-based delivery of e-learning courses. Through original e-learning module purchase, Fleet and Family Readiness Training did not receive e-learning development file versions of these 30 e-learning modules and will need a vendor to create updated versions in current e-learning development software. Fleet and Family Readiness Training is seeking an external vendor to convert these 30 e-learning modules to a more contemporary, rapid development e-learning package publication format, and provide as deliverables an e-learning development file and final publication file for each of the 30 e-learning modules.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT and<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />Domestic and Foreign Armored Vehicle Platforms
<p>1.0	Description</p>
<p>1.1 Multiple U.S. Government agencies are seeking information on current or potential development of armored vehicle ("base unit") platforms for the production of armored vehicles.  Of specific interest is a sedan-type platform with:</p>
<p>&bull;	Availability (production-ready) within four (4) to five (5) years<br />&bull;	Adequate room for passenger and cargo accommodation, and <br />&bull;	Available payload capacity to facilitate protective armoring.</p>
<p>A commercial production vehicle meeting requirements is preferred, but none have been identified. To meet future needs, the Government may be willing to partner with an Automotive Manufacturer, either Foreign or Domestic, (in accordance with Federal Regulation and mandatory sources) to modify a production vehicle or develop a vehicle that meets operational requirements.  This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to begin early engagement with industry and gather market information while identifying Automotive Manufacturers interested in future development.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if any is issued; however, industry responses, or lack of responses may impact the future strategy of Government acquisition efforts.</p>
<p>2.0	Background</p>
<p>Several U.S. Government agencies utilize commercial vehicles as a base platform for production of armored vehicles for various end uses. There are no known vehicles suitable for this purpose planned for production that are available within a four to five-year window, that will meet the available payload and passenger/cargo space requirements, and that can serve as a suitable base vehicle for the armoring process.  The U.S. Government would like to determine what future commercial vehicles can meet, or be modified to meet, capacity requirements to serve as base vehicles for armoring. The Government also seeks to identify interested Automotive Manufactures that may be interested in a future vehicle development effort to manufacture a suitable SUV that will be available within five years, with expected production over eight to ten years with no or limited modification.</p>
<p>2.1 Planned Production: Production needs are based on various factors and depend on fleet condition, domestic policy, and world events.  Production rates are expected to vary from year-to-year, with expectations ranging from very few per year up to less than five-hundred base vehicles per year across all U.S. Government agencies.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period: Vehicles meeting the capacity requirements are expected to have an on-going production requirement.</p>
<p>2.3 Limitations: Provide separate information for:</p>
<p>&bull;	Vehicles  of domestic manufacture for use within the United States, and<br />&bull;	Vehicles of domestic or foreign manufacture for use outside of the United States.</p>
<p>All vehicles considered are expected to comply with applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and meet stated capacity needs and other listed requirements.  Due to the limited number of vehicles that are expected to be produced, a limited scope of FMVSS evaluation may be acceptable, with a trade-off between engineering assessment and physical validation being a consideration.</p>
<p>2.4 Security Requirements: Security requirements for this RFI and future vehicles purchased on affiliated contracts is anticipated to be limited to For Official Use Only (FOUO).</p>
<p>3.0	Objectives</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information on commercial production vehicles, planned production vehicles, modified production vehicles, specialty production vehicles, and custom produced vehicles that best meet the following specifications.  Modified commercial vehicles and custom produced vehicles should optimize the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components to provide validated reliability and facilitate enhanced support.</p>
<p>3.1 Sedans - For this RFI, sedans are the preferred vehicle format.   To be a suitable solution, availability and identification of appropriate wheels and tires that are rated to support the armored gross vehicle weight (GVW) (approximately the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), including payload (armor, passengers, and equipment)) is required. AGVWR of approximately 7,500 to 8,500 pounds is expected.  A GVWR significantly higher (thousands of pounds) than this amount may introduce transportation challenges, and one significantly lower would need to demonstrate a robust structure to continually support the armor weight through the vehicle's 5 to 7 year expected life cycle.</p>
<p>3.1.1	Commercial production vehicles that meet capacity requirements as delivered are the preferred option.  Production vehicles that can meet objectives with limited modifications are the second choice, while heavily modified production vehicles are preferred over specialty vehicles.  Custom-built vehicles that meet all other objectives are an acceptable option, but are considered a high-risk solution due to a lack of operational performance data and other factors.  Modifications should be developed by the original equipment (vehicle) manufacturer (OEM) or a qualified automotive integrator with the ability to conduct required design and engineering analysis.  Assessment and certification to FMVSS is highly desired.  Vehicles with civilian styling that do not draw extra attention are preferred, while a tactical or military vehicle appearance is undesirable.  The configuration should include four (4) side doors.  The vehicle should include typical features/amenities of modern commercial sedans. The vehicle must possess at least 17 cubic feet of trunk space.</p>
<p>3.1.2	An extended production range, technical support, and long-term spare parts availability and support network (both CONUS and OCONUS) is highly desired.</p>
<p>3.1.3	Desired Specifications</p>
<p>Available Payload	800 pounds threshold (State Department)<br /> 900 pounds target (Others)<br /> 1000 pounds objective<br /> <br /> Gross Vehicle Weight Rating	GVWR as needed to facilitate curb weight and required available payload.<br /> <br /> Tires, brakes, suspension	As needed to confidently facilitate GVWR<br /> <br /> Passengers/Storage Space	4 or 5 passengers (seating dependent) with additional trunk space for equipment and luggage.</p>
<p>Height		60 inches Maximum</p>
<p>Total Width (inc. tires)	75 inches body side to body side<br /> <br /> Overall Length	205 inches Maximum desired<br /> <br /> Wheelbase 	Approximately112 inches is optimum <br /> <br /> General Size	Fit in an ISO standard shipping container</p>
<p>Turning Diameter/Circle	22 feet, smaller diameter desired<br /> <br /> Ground Clearance	5 inches, more desired<br /> <br /> <br /> Maximum Step-in Height	13 inches from ground to rear door rocker/sill, lower desired</p>
<p>Minimum Interior Headroom 	Seated	38 inches, identify seating position</p>
<p>Automotive Performance	Range	 300 Miles minimum, extended range is of higher priority than maximum speed<br /> <br /> Max Speed	100 MPH minimum, at tire speed and load rating<br /> <br /> Acceleration	MPH in 8.5 seconds, minimum, at GVWR, greater desired</p>
<p>Factory installed turbocharger or supercharger is acceptable if needed to achieve performance requirements.  Aftermarket superchargers are not acceptable.</p>
<p>Engine Performance (HP)	390 Threshold for gasoline engine version<br /> 450 Objective for gasoline engine version<br /> Negotiable for diesel engine version if other performance criteria achieved<br /> <br /> Torque		300 pound-feet Threshold<br /> 360 pound-feet Objective</p>
<p>Engine Type	Options for both gasoline and "dirty" diesel engines desired.</p>
<p>Interior		Consistent with OEM standard fit and finish<br /> Without supplemental restraint system (air bags), or as option</p>
<p>4.0	Requested Information</p>
<p>Identification of Automotive Manufacturers interested in working with the Government to develop an SUV meeting stated automotive requirements, or preferably identification of planned future production SUV vehicles that meet stated requirements.

<CONTACT>Brian Pellerin, Chief, Hydrologic Networks Branch, Phone 703-648-6865, Email gs-w_ngwos_rfi@usgs.gov - Esther Eng, Technology Transfer Officer, Phone (703) 648-7550, Email gs-a_opa@usgs.gov
<DESC><strong>Opportunity:</strong> The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is seeking information from industry, academia, nonprofits, and research institutions on innovative technologies that should be considered as part of the Next Generation Water Observing System (NGWOS) effort ongoing within the USGS.  This includes technologies that strategically enhance the temporal and spatial collection of water quantity, quality, and water-use data in surface and groundwater across the United States.   The data will be served through a modernized USGS National Water Information System that will be coupled to advanced modeling tools to inform daily water operations, decision-making during water emergencies, assessments of past trends in water quantity and quality, and forecasts of future water availability.
<div><br /></div>
<div>NGWOS aims to foster innovation and development of monitoring technologies and methodologies to make data more affordable and more rapidly available. Monitoring innovations also are expected to lead to more types of data at higher temporal and spatial frequencies. The application and benefits of these innovations will extend beyond the NGWOS watersheds and be incorporated into routine operation of USGS monitoring networks.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This Request for Information (RFI) is to help identify promising technologies or interested partners who are capable of jointly developing technologies that can integrate with current USGS research and development per the Stevenson&shy;Wydler Act (15 U.S.C. &sect; 3710a, as amended). Responses to this RFI should briefly describe the proposed technology, including the type of data collected, potential applications for the data, and the technology readiness / product maturity level.  Technologies of interest include but are not limited to:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>- Non-contact sensing for velocity, stage, and water temperature,
<div>
<p>- Long range, low power observation network technologies,</p>
<p>- Instrumentation for monitoring hydrologic budgets (ET, soil moisture, snowpack and water-use),</p>
<p>- New sensors for monitoring continuous water-quality, including sediment, nutrients, contaminants, and environmental DNA,</p>
<p>- Mobile autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and drifters for water quality and flow monitoring,&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Webcams and drone-mounted sensors for operational and science applications,<br />Innovative technologies for detecting and monitoring hazards such as spills and harmful algal blooms (HABs).</p>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. If proprietary information is submitted, clearly mark this information as Confidential. The USGS will protect this information from disclosure if it meets the Federal FOIA exemptions.</p>

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
10300 Spotsylvania Ave, Suite 400
Fredericksburg, VA 22408

Description: North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for Medical Coding is 541219   Other Accounting Services .  It falls under Subsector 541   Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.  The applicable size standard is $20,500,000 in US Dollars.

Background Information:  During FY2015 the SAC awarded six (6) BPAs with 60-month ordering periods in accordance with ( IAW ) FAR Sub-Part 8.4 to six separate contractors who were small businesses and possessed FSS GSA contracts.  These BPAs expire during the month of December 2019.  The SAC anticipates issuing a solicitation prior to the expiration of the six noted BPAs.  Based upon historic data it is evident that portions of the actual coding are being sub-contracted to large businesses.  The VA adheres to the  Rule of Two  analysis in accordance with Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. vs. United States, 579 U.S.       (2016) and 38 U.S.C. 8127.

Issuing BPAs to small businesses, VOSBs, or SDVOSBs in which those firms simply sub-contract a large portion of that work to large businesses can pose inherent risks and undue costs to the tax payers.  VA seeks value for the tax dollars it spends and having a  pass-through  or  straw-man  small business creates additional costs and defeats in some measure the policies and goals behind set-asides.  Further, current trends appear to suggest firms hire 1099 employees (see www.irs.gov/form1099) to avoid DOL WDs, and/or Executive Orders 13672 13706, and 13788.  Alternatively, firms with a very small employee base turn into hiring/recruiting agencies at the time of quote to meet USG solicitations.  Limitations on sub-contracting is governed by FAR 52.219-14 (DEV. 2019-o0003) 12/3/2018.  Additionally, the SAC has had to engage prime contractor(s) (small businesses) under the current award(s) to ensure the latter paid their sub-contractor(s) (large businesses).  These issues, among others, have created substantial risks, costs, and undue administration to the USG.  Further, the applicable NAICS Code size standard may necessarily preclude small businesses from these BPAs depending on the number of BPAs awarded. 

Medical Coding is a very common commercial service.  The scope of VA s anticipatory BPAs is to assign the current HIPAA standard code sets as appropriate, e.g. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition Clinical Modification and Procedural Coding System; Common Procedural Terminology; and Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System Level II codes based on health record documentation of outpatient, surgical, inpatient care, and inpatient professional services provided at or under the auspices of a Veterans Health Administration facility, to include all Community Based Outpatient Clinics, when applicable, and to conduct coding audits of billable and non-billable inpatient and outpatient episodes of care as requested by a Veterans Health Administration facility.

Questions:  Questions regarding this SSN shall only be submitted in writing by e-mail to Mark.Blevins2@VA.Gov and James.Modlin@VA.Gov.  It is in the discretion of the contracting officer to respond to any questions.   Telephone calls will NOT be accepted.

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 06,  Durham VA Medical Center
NCO 06/RPO East PR# 558-19-4-122-0483.

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  This is for the procurement of 1 Lumenis Smart Selecta Trio (SST) System (GA-0001700) which includes Smart LIO for Vision 1/Smart 532 FC (AC-1076030), Digital Camera (OD0200043), installation, and on-site training.  This system is used by the eye clinic for treatment of ailments.  Estimated amount is $106,900.00 


Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  Lumenis Tri laser is produced by Lumenis INC. and the capabilities and features are unique to this model, where they have combined three laser treatment strategies in one unit, thus saving time, space and cost and improves treatment efficiency. This combination Laser enables Doctors to keep the patient at one location and complete the treatment with the same unit without moving the patient. keeping the patient stationary and completing the treatment in one sitting reduces patient discomfort, provider focus and reduce patient injury and thus improves patient safety. Our current Duet laser has been malfunctioning and the attempted repairs are proved short term. We need a robust unit to treat patients for Glaucoma and anterior segments of the EYE, since we have a high volume of patients who needs these treatments. The Lumenis laser is our main laser unit and the malfunctioning / downtime cause interruption in patient treatment and we are forced to cancel Laser clinics and disrupt patient treatment. We are forced to send patients on fee basis. Feeing Laser patients are expensive and do not result in good patient outcome.  The current Lumenis laser is inoperable and beyond repair.  Durham VAMC only has one system and everyday this system is down negatively affects our mission to provide veteran quality healthcare.  This emergency purchase is to ensure continuity of treatment of our veteran community. 


Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  ECAT, GSA Advantage, NAC and FPDS were searched with no results.  Communication with the manufacturer for product availability.  All items except for the digital camera will be shipped once order is placed.  Manufacturer assured the service the absence of the digital camera will not affect patient treatment.  VIP was searched and suggested vendor were among the registrants.  This procurement is using FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency in which a delay in award could cause serious injury to our Veteran patients by not being able to receive the treatment they need for their ailments.   

 
Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to contract via single-source procedures.

The FAA intends to award a single-source, follow-on contract to Frequentis, USA, Inc. (FUSA) (Duns No.: 080706851) to provide maintenance and sustainment support services for the previously purchased and deployed Conference Control System (CCS) located at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) located in Warrenton, VA (CCS-W). The anticipated award will occur in March 2020. 

The FAA seeks industry comments to our intent to award the single-source, follow-on contract. The anticipated contract will be a 4 year (2 year base with 2 option years) single source sustainment contract to Frequentis USA, the incumbent contractor under FAA contract # DTFAWA-09-C-00092.  The anticipated period of performance is March 2020 through February 2024. 

The FAA ATCSCC is responsible for monitoring the overall traffic demand on the National Airspace System (NAS) and for assessing the capabilities of the NAS to meet those demands.  Demands on the NAS include the flow of air traffic, including air and ground delays.  The FAA Administrator has designated the ATCSCC as the lead in resolving flight delay problems.  The CCS-W was procured specifically for the ATCSCC, Warrenton, VA.

The CCS-W, awarded to FUSA on September 10, 2009 under FAA contract DTFAWA-09-C-00092, is a high-capacity telecommunications conferencing system.  FAA specialists at the ATCSCC use the CCS to coordinate with national and international aviation and weather organizations to establish and maintain telecommunications conferences to expedite the flow of air traffic and enhance the safety and integrity of the NAS.  The current contract duration is 10 years, consisting of a 24-month Base Period followed by four (4) 24-month Option Periods; the contract expires in March 2020. 

The subject single-source, follow-on contract will provide supplies and services to maintain and sustain the FUSA manufactured CCS-W, which was produced and installed in September 2010 and became operational in March 2011.  The work includes: Program Management, Configuration Management; Technical Support Services providing engineering support to resolve technical issues while maintaining the approved operational configuration baseline; Contractor site Test Bed maintenance; Contractor Depot Logistics Support (CDLS); Integrated Logistics Support including supply and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) support; failure summary analysis; restoration of hardware and software to serviceable condition; and operator, supervisor / administrator and maintenance training.  

The FAA has begun its preparations for a competitive procurement, anticipated for the 2023-2025 timeframe, for the CCS; specifically a system capable of coordinating between national and international aviation and weather organizations to establish and maintain telecommunications conferences to expedite the flow of air traffic and enhance the safety and integrity of the NAS.  In the interim, the CCS-W needs to continue 24x7 operations to balance air traffic demand with system capacity to minimize delays and congestion while maximizing the overall use of the NAS. 

FUSA USA is the only one manufacturer who possesses the technical data and engineering expertise to maintain and sustain the Frequentis VCS3020X platform communication system architecture, equipment, and software.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement.

Your comments to our intent to award a single-source, follow-on contract to FUSA for the period of performance of four (4) years, 2-year base with 2 one-year options, must be directed to the Contracting Officer no later than 5:00 pm EST on November 15, 2019, to the following email address: Mary.M.Johnson@faa.gov

Airport Technology Research & Development Contract Strategy Industry Day 


The FAA William J Hughes Technical Center is planning an Industry Day on December 3, 2019 to discuss the acquisition strategy relative to the Airport Technology Research and Development (ATRD) program. 


For those interested in supporting the ATRD program, the Industry Day will provide information on the revised approach the FAA has adopted in procuring the services needed to support this program. 


Historically, support for ATRD has been procured primarily through one multi-year contract vehicle. In recent years, the ATRD portfolio has become more diverse and complex. This requires a new approach to effectively support the program. The FAA has identified distinct functional areas, programs, or projects that may be supported separately through various contract mechanisms. The various facets of this program and the specific acquisition strategies intended to be applied to each will be discussed.  


You are invited to join us to hear about the many new opportunities available to industry and academia to support this historically budgeted $33 Million a year program.  


Tours of the ATRD buildings and labs will take place in the afternoon to allow prospective bidders on future procurement opportunities to view the facilities. 


For additional information on the ATRD program, please visit their website:  https://www.airporttech.tc.faa.gov/ 



***THIS IS A FREE EVENT, HOWEVER, YOU MUST REGISTER TO ATTEND***

Follow-up discussions may be conducted with respondents.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>On October 10, 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security approved and granted extraordinary relief to Eastern Shipbuilding Group, Inc., on its OPC contract, for up to four hulls as a result of the impact of Hurricane Michael (DHS &amp; USCG press releases are available at the following links: https://www.dcms.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Acquisitions-CG-9/Newsroom/Latest-Acquisition-News/Article/1987279/department-of-homeland-security-approves-limited-extraordinary-relief-for-offsh/ and https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/10/11/dhs-extends-contract-relief-offshore-patrol-cutter). <br /><br />The USCG is now working to further develop and finalize its acquisition strategy for completing the OPC Program of Record of 25 hulls. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain feedback on a notional OPC acquisition approach and schedule for completing the OPC Program of Record as soon as possible. <br /><br /><strong>Notional Approach &amp; Schedule</strong><br /><br />Attachment 1&nbsp;is a notional schedule that outlines a high-level acquisition approach where multiple Government-funded Industry Studies contracts may be awarded to assist in the refinement and completion of the existing OPC Detail Design and the development of a Detail Design and Construction (DD&amp;C) solicitation to facilitate delivery of affordable OPCs to the fleet as quickly as possible, while reducing program risk over the course of the Program of Record. Under this approach, it is anticipated that upon completion of Industry Studies, the USCG would award one or more competitive contract(s) for completing the Detail Design and Construction (DD&amp;C) of OPCs in a continued effort to fulfill the USCG's Program of Record requirements for 25 OPCs. <br /><br />In order to meet the OPC Program's operational fleet needs, it is assumed that Shipbuilders would utilize the mature parts of the existing OPC functional design - to the maximum extent possible - and mature any incomplete aspects of the detail design. The existing functional design, including selected 2D design drawings, calculations, and diagrams, will be made available for Industry Studies contract awardees and will not be warranted by the Government. While schedule is a major driver, program affordability must remain a constant consideration. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Industry Studies Contracts</span></strong>: In early FY20, the USCG intends to release a solicitation for multiple-award, Government-funded Industry Studies to prospective prime Shipbuilders for an OPC Detail Design and Construction (DD&amp;C) contract. It is anticipated that the Government will award Industry Studies contracts to Shipbuilders able to build (i.e., with a certified launch facility), design (i.e., Shipbuilders with in-house design capability or a designer as a team member), and have the capacity to deliver (i.e., within the shipyard's current build schedule) OPCs featuring Command and Control, Navigation, Aviation, and Navy-furnished Combat systems no later than the dates included in the notional schedule below. As part of the Industry Studies solicitation, the Government may provide a draft OPC System Specification, technical data package, and draft DD&amp;C Statement of Work. This data describes a basic OPC functional design, which has completed a Critical Design Review. Shipbuilders may be required to use this non-warranted data as the basis for completing an affordable Detail Design of the OPC on an accelerated delivery timeline. An overview (placemat) of this functional design will also be provided to Industry Study awardees. As part of Industry Studies, the Government is interested in understanding how the 2D functional design will be transitioned and incorporated into a final 3D production design for OPC construction at each Shipbuilder's facility. It is anticipated that each Shipbuilder will conduct several cost, schedule, capability and technical studies to support validation and refinement of its proposed OPC Detail Design and transition to a production design. The results of the Industry Studies will further inform a Government RFP for an OPC DD&amp;C contract.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Detail Design and Construction (DD&amp;C) Contract(s):</span></strong> The Program intends to release an RFP, through separate full and open competition, leading to award of Long Lead Time Material (LLTM) and DD&amp;C for OPCs in an effort to complete the OPC Program of Record of 25 hulls.<br /><br />The OPC Program seeks industry feedback on the notional program schedule (Attachment 1) as well as industry feedback on how construction of OPCs could be further accelerated and how acceleration would affect program risk and cost.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br />Requested Information from Industry</strong><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acquisition Strategy Feedback</span></strong><br /><br />1. Given the publicly-available information and description provided above on the status of the OPC program, please provide a recommended contracting approach for the USCG to obtain Long Lead Time Material (LLTM), Detail Design, and Construction of OPCs in an effort to complete its Program of Record of 25 hulls. Describe perceived risks, impediments to competition, and opportunities available to the USCG to incentivize robust industry interest and competition and maintain program affordability. Examples of other input being sought includes, but is not limited to, contract type, Industry Studies scope of work, performance incentives, evaluation criteria, source selection approach, etc.<br /><br />2. Identify risks with the notional approach described in this RFI, suggest measures to mitigate risk, and identify potential opportunities to accelerate the notional schedule, while maintaining program affordability.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Provide a notional plan of action and milestones for how your company would meet or accelerate the delivery dates depicted in the notional schedule provided in this RFI, while maintaining program affordability. <br /><br />4. Identify how your company would approach using a Government-provided, non-warranted functional design to construct one or more OPCs. Discuss any potential technical risks associated with refining/completing an existing design from industry's perspective. Describe your company's preferred approach to completing an OPC production design, based on the notional schedule outlined in this request, and how your company views a requirement to utilize a non-warranted functional design data package. <br /><br />5. Provide input on the potential use of a block buy contracting approach during the course of the program and recommendations for incorporation of such an approach if your company deems that block buy contracting is feasible. Also, if your company deems that block buy contracting is not feasible, explain the rationale against using this approach. <br /><br />6. Indicate if constructing two hulls per year is feasible and provide your company's expected shipbuilding capacity with respect to constructing multiple hulls per year. Any recommendations or input on the overall production schedule are encouraged. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Respondent Company Information</span></strong><br /><br />7.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br /><br />This notice is prepared in accordance with (IAW) FAR 5.207 and is not a Request for Quote (RFQ). RFQ number 70Z03820QH0000005 is assigned for tracking purposes only. This is a notice of the Government's intent to issue one (1) purchase order on a sole source basis. The proposed contractor is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Corporation, 86 S. Cobb Drive, Marietta, GA 30066-0001 for procurement of the following component for use on the HC-130 aircraft.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION QUANTITY UNIT OF ISSUE UNIT PRICE EXTENDED PRICE<br />Cap, Center Wing Flap Track 5 Each</p>
<p><br />The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the small business size standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>Period of Performance will begin at award through final delivery.</p>
<p>Set Aside: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, under the authority of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), 41 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B). There is no set-aside for small business. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quotation which will be considered by the agency.

<p>Title: W9126G20R0012, Construction: Lewisville Spillway, Lewisville, Texas.</p>
<p>Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at</p>
<p>U.S. Army Engineer District, Fort Worth<br />ATTN: CESWF-CT (Matthew S. Dickson) matthew.s.dickson@usace.army.mil <br />Post Office Box 17300 or 819 Taylor Street (2a17) (if using express mail)<br />Fort Worth, TX 76102-0300</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million). This market survey is being posted for Project: Lewisville Spillway. This will be a solicitation for a Construction contract for a single C- Type awarded contract for Fiscal Year 21.</p>
<p>THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Government plans to repair the Lewisville Spillway as part of the overall Lewisville Dam Safety Modifications Project, Lewisville, Texas.</p>
<p>Scope Summary:</p>
<p>Measures to address the structural stability concerns associated with post-tensioned anchors installed through the ogee weir, and an upstream geomembrane blanket. The design will continue to be refined in FY20, but at this time consists of 99 anchors installed to a depth of 70 ft. A work platform or rail system will be required to install the anchors along the downstream slope of the monoliths. The upstream geomembrane blanket will be installed in the approach channel of the spillway below the current grade and attached to the ogee monoliths. The membrane will extend upstream and be covered with the material removed for its installation. The apron slab overlay will install apron slabs over the existing apron slabs to address uplift and sliding concerns. Each overlay slap will have anchors installed, however the number of anchors varies depending on the distance from the ogee weir.</p>
<p>Magnitude: $25,000,000 - $100,000,000</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 540 Days from Notice to Proceed</p>
<p><strong>Project Labor Agreement</strong>:</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)<br />Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Matthew S. Dickson, at matthew.s.dickson@usace.army.mil no later than 11:00 a.m. 29 November 2019.</p>

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation   Commercial Items.  The Government shall award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: past performance, price and technical acceptance.  Past performance and technical acceptance when combined are more important than price.
Options.  For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows:
The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but for no more than a total of six months during the life of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised. The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8." 
FAR 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year;  Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond 30 September 2017. The Government s obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)<br />Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com.<br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care.<br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p class="MsoNormal">In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope.

<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p><br />NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) ACQUISITION REGULATION CLAUSES</p>
<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office Ombudsman (Oct 2016) NAM<br />a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.<br />b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance<br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 1300 hrs PST, October 25, 2019.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Joel Heisler at (541) 867-8763 or joel.heisler@noaa.gov for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /> <br /> - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br /> - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br /> - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br /> - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br /> - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br /> - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

<DESC>This is Pre-Solictation Notice of Solictation 33330220RF0010005 it is anticipated the full solictation will come out approximately November 5th
<div>Below is brief description of SOW.</div>
<div>
<div>This contract procurement is in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (AE) Act as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6.&nbsp; The objective is to provide planning and design services for the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (HMSG).&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 541310 (Architectural Services) and the size standard under this code is $7,500,000 (maximum average annual receipts to qualify as a Small Business per 13 CFR &sect; 121.104 a).&nbsp; This announcement is open to all qualified businesses regardless of size.&nbsp; The contract awarded will be firm-fixed-price.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>PROJECT INFORMATION:&nbsp;</div>
<div>This announcement is for the selection and award of an Architect-Engineer Multidiscipline Contract that would provide planning and design support for the revitalization of the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (HMSG), the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s museum of modern and contemporary art itself housed in an outstanding example of modernist architectural design on the National Mall.&nbsp; The current size of the HMSG is approximately 172,240 gross square feet (16,001 sq. meters).&nbsp; This project is for the Revitalization of the Museum Building and Plaza</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Objective: To provide planning and design services for HMSG for a complete interior rehabilitation, for components of an exterior rehabilitation, and for museum expansion.&nbsp; The project includes art handling and exhibit spaces, office and conservation laboratory spaces, auditorium and education space design, historic preservation, replacement of the majority of building systems, new vertical transportation, hazmat abatement, blast and chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) mitigation and potential expansion, including underground areas. This scope of work includes the development of pre-project planning and programming documents, studies, concept design, schematic design, design development, construction documents, and A/E Construction Phase Services as well as services to achieve USGBC - LEED and/or SITES certification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></div>
<div>Background:&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (HMSG), designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft, FAIA, of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, opened to the public in 1974. The museum is located at the northwest corner of 7th Street and Independence Avenue, SW, and the Sculpture Garden is north of the museum across Jefferson Drive. The building is a cylindrical volume 231 feet in diameter raised 14 feet above a paved plaza on four concrete piers. The building is clad in crushed pink granite aggregate precast concrete panels. Beneath the center of the drum is a courtyard with a large, shallow, bronze fountain. The minimally articulated solid outer shell contrasts with the walls of the inner courtyard, composed of equal, glazed cells that light the interior galleries. The museum building has four above-grade stories and a basement, extending below most of the plaza that surrounds the building. The plaza connects to the Sculpture Garden via an underground passage below Jefferson Drive that is currently enclosed and used for educational programs.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden is a Contributing Building of the National Mall Historic District and has been determined to be Individually Eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Major alterations to the building include revisions to the gift shop in 1986 and 2010, an expansion to the loading dock in 2008, conversion of the underground passage beneath Jefferson Drive to education space in 2010, and a new Conservation Lab added to the fourth level in 2019. Other, smaller alterations include black box spaces in the basement that allow for exhibitions of video and other new media art and a lobby caf&eacute; designed by Hiroshi Sugimoto. Landscape Architect Lester Collins designed a rehabilitation of the Sculpture Garden in 1981 and the Plaza underwent design revisions in 1993 by Urban and Associates. Current projects not a part of this contract include replacement of the exterior precast panels and roof and modernization of the existing vertical transportation systems including the elevators and replacement of loading dock levelers.&nbsp; The revitalization of the Sculpture Garden, already underway, is not a part of this contract. That project will be complete before this project goes into construction and will provide continuity of museum programing during the rehabilitation and expansion of the main museum building and plaza.&nbsp; Future connectivity and a possible new main entrance to the museum from the sculpture garden will explored during this project&rsquo;s planning phase and may be part of the design scope for this project.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Design Considerations:&nbsp; The revitalization design should be constrained and respectful of the historic Bunshaft building and site as well as engaging and responsive to the National Mall and broader urban context. This undertaking will re-envision the building to support diverse modern and contemporary art programming for the next 50 years.&nbsp; This effort shall consider expansion, new or improved public access, the addition of amenities and event spaces, prioritization of program for the campus, structural and envelope improvements, updated building systems that are robust, resilient, and versatile, and improvements to the plaza to include replacement of waterproofing, repair or replacement of the plaza walls, and repair of the fountain. The Smithsonian seeks a talented design team with the proven ability to integrate creative design and systems engineering solutions within a constrained modern historic context.</div>

<DESC>This is a presolictation Notice anticipated solictation should be posted around November 7th
<div>Below is brief overview of scope of work</div>
<div>The Smithsonian Institution intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract to perform periodic, routine, acceptance inspections and tests for all of the Vertical Transportation (VT) and Conveyance equipment at the Smithsonian Institution facilities within the Washington DC Metropolitan area, Maryland, Virginia and New York City to include passenger and freight elevators, escalators, dumbwaiters, side-walk lifts, special lifts, material lifts, wheel chair lifts, loading dock lifts and levelers that are included in the attached inventory. The inventory is subject to change due to expected and unexpected circumstances that can increase or decrease the total unit count. A thirty (30) day notice or as much notice as possible will be given in the event of these changes. The firm fixed price shall include all of the personnel, management, supervision and duties to perform routine, periodic, acceptance inspections and tests such as but not limited to annual testing, five (5) year load testing, labor, lodging, expenditures, scheduling, logs, data collecting, reporting, accounting, etc. in a thorough, complete, legible and timely manner as required by all applicable code requirements and specifications. The weights needed to perform the 5 year load tests will be provided by the current Smithsonian Institution vertical transportation maintenance and repair Contractor. The current Smithsonian Institution vertical transportation maintenance and repair Contractor will also be made available to provide access, accompany, assist and operate the equipment during the tests and inspections. The schedule for all testing and inspection will be created by the COTR in conjunction with the various Smithsonian facilities. Scheduling will be done in a way to maximize the amount of inspections done per day and minimize any VT down time and impact on the facility. The Smithsonian will also require unit pricing on a per hour basis for any unscheduled emergency testing which may be required, as needed, in order to allow inventoried equipment to be returned to service after such incidents as, but not limited to entrapments, abuse, vandalism, etc. upon request. All emergency response inspections are to be completed and COTR is to be notified of the status of the unit within twenty-four (24) hours of initial notification. The Smithsonian Institution requires the successful contractor be capable of assisting in an in-depth, third party assessment of the VT equipment in the Smithsonian inventory. As part of this assessment, contractor could be asked to verify items on the inventory sheet, assess the condition of various elevator components and give an overall life expectation for the various units in the inventory. This capability would be on an as needed basis and charged on the normal elevator inspection call service hourly rates provided in section 1.1. The Smithsonian Institution intends to award a one (1) year contact with the right to exercise the option to extend this contract for nine (9) additional one (1) year period(s).&nbsp;</div>

The government will apply the following comparative evaluation process as the basis for award:
Assess the direct comparison of one quote with another in a uniform and fair manner to determine which quote provides the government what it needs, where and when in accordance with the Statement of Need (SON) and this Request for Quote. It is an assessment of which response is  best  as a whole.

- Technical:  Each offeror s quote shall be evaluated based on equipment and services specifications, to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need and demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of those requirements and their associated risk.

Information not contained in a vendor s quote will not be considered during the evaluation. The Government intends to make award selection without clarification but may determine after evaluating submitted quotes that the elements stated in FAR 13.106-2(b)(3) for evaluation procedures are necessary and conduct them as appropriate.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

<p>Solicitation Number: W912HY19R5328<br />Set-Aside Code: Unrestricted Full and Open Competition<br />Response Date: 22 April 2019</p>
<p>Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E Services for this contract include, but are not limited to, survey, investigations, comprehensive planning, technical analysis, modeling, engineering, design, construction phase services, and any necessary project and technical requirements that support the design and implementation of the project features. Capabilities include, but are not limited to, the development of preliminary studies through feasibility report development; engineering design through detailed plans, specifications; design/build request for proposal packages; design analysis/design documentation report preparation; value engineering; cost estimates, technical and bid-ability, constructability, operability, environmental, and sustainability (BCOES) reviews; real estate acquisition support; engineering during construction; and construction phase services for the Freeport levee system improvements and ecosystem restoration. The A-E may also be required to participate in teams executing projects through alternative methods of delivery that include, but are not limited to, early contractor involvement, pre-qualification of sources, etc.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for A-E services with a total capacity of $72M.</p>
<p>Selection of the A-E firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only the firm considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. A single award will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of eight (8) years, which includes a four (4) year base period and two (2) two-year options. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $72,000,000 over the eight-year life of the contract.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years. All interested Other than Small Business A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, compliance with FAR 52.219-9 is required, which includes a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. This plan will be submitted for review during the contract negotiation phase.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay is located along the upper Texas coast, comprising the coastlines of six counties: Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, Jefferson, Chambers and Orange. The project covers a 120-mile stretch of the upper Texas coast along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from the Texas/Louisiana border at Sabine Pass in the east, to the western end of Galveston Island at San Luis Pass in the southwest. The project area includes Gulf and bay waters, barrier islands, marshes, coastal wetlands, rivers and streams and adjacent areas that make up the interrelated coastal area. Critical coastal ecosystems including sea turtle nesting habitat, piping plover critical habitat as well as two state and Federal wildlife refuges are within the project area. This region is home to more than five million people and is a major economic hub for Houston (Nation's fourth largest city), Freeport, Beaumont, and Port Arthur. Three of the Nation's top ten deep-draft ports, and 40 percent of the Nation's petrochemical industry lies within the project's footprint. In the entire study area, over 200 houses and up to 40,000 people are affected by shore erosion. This reach of the upper Texas coastal zone is at risk from wind and surge damage during storm events. The area has experienced significant shoreline erosion causing the destruction of nationally significant wetlands, loss of land and damage to homes, commercial property, and State Highway 87. Over the last ten years, the entire area was significantly altered both physically and economically causing billions in damages.</p>
<p>A "new start" feasibility study was performed to evaluate alternatives to address the problems identified, and the final study recommendations were approved by the Chief of Engineers on 7 December 2017. The recommended plan consists of three Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) measures: 1) Orange, which includes a new levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, pump stations, drainage structures, and closure gates); 2) Port Arthur (and vicinity), which includes improvements and extension to an existing levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, and closure gates); and 3) Freeport (and vicinity), which includes improvements to an existing levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, closure gates, drainage structures, pump station, and navigable sector gate). These three CSRM measures each function as independent systems. This SATOC is to support the design and implementation of the Freeport levee system improvements and ecosystem restoration. The Freeport system includes, but is not limited to, raising 13.1 miles of the existing earthen levee system, constructing/reconstructing approximately 5.5 miles of floodwall, constructing ten vehicle closure structures at road and railroad crossings, constructing various drainage structures, raising the Highway 332 crossing, providing additional capacity to an existing pump station, and installing a navigable sector gate. Services will be implemented with negotiated, firm fixed price (FFP) task orders (TOs) in the magnitude of $1M to $25M, unless approved by the Contracting Officer up to the capacity of the SATOC.</p>
<p>According to the Director's Policy Memorandum for Civil Works 2018-09, Principals of Delivery for the 2018 Emergency Supplemental, delivery targets were established for the completion of any necessary investigations, analyses, engineering, and design is one year with a target to complete all construction by January 2022 for construction less than $100M, January 2023 for construction ranging from $100 Million to $500 Million, and January 2024 for construction greater than $500 Million. As the feasibility study cost estimate for the Freeport levee system was $606 Million, SWG will be held to meeting these delivery targets.</p>

Failure to acknowledge receipt of this amendment may result in the proposal being considered non-responsive.</p>
<p><br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Marketing Services (AMS) requests quotations from responsible sources to provide marine cargo discharge/delivery survey services in Niger.</p>
<p>The services will include surveys of containerized, bulk, and breakbulk commodities for food assistance programs. It is the intention of the Government to award a firm-fixed price contract to one firm.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Marketing Service procures staple foods for use in various international food aid programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The food is purchased in bulk and packaged form and transported overseas by ocean carriers to discharge ports or foreign inland destinations for delivery to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVO), or foreign governments. Given the inherent nature of transporting bulk and packaged food long distances by sea and overland in foreign nations, there is a potential for loss or damage.</p>
<p>To address this risk, a marine cargo survey is performed for each food aid shipment during unloading at the foreign destination. The products subject to marine cargo discharge/delivery survey service include dry staple foods such as rice, peas, beans, and lentils; dry blended foods such as wheat-soy blend and corn-soy blend; and vegetable oil type products. This food aid is typically packaged in polypropylene or paper bags ranging in size from 25 to 50 kilograms, cardboard cartons containing consumer-pack quantities, liquid 20 liter pails, 6/4 liter containers, and 208 liter drums. Bulk grain and oil cargoes may be shipped such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal and vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Agricultural commodities for food assistance programs are shipped overseas using three shipment methods: containerized shipments, breakbulk shipments, and bulk shipments. Cargoes will be shipped port-to-port or on through bills of lading where the cargoes are transported to inland locations.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

<DESC>Notice for an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) for a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Architect and Engineering (AE) Services to Support the Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay, Coastal Storm Risk Management and Ecosystem Restoration, Freeport (and Vicinity)
<p>Solicitation Number: W912HY19R5328<br />Set-Aside Code: Unrestricted Full and Open Competition<br />Response Date:&nbsp;30 April 2019</p>
<p>Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E Services for this contract include, but are not limited to, survey, investigations, comprehensive planning, technical analysis, modeling, engineering, design, construction phase services, and any necessary project and technical requirements that support the design and implementation of the project features. Capabilities include, but are not limited to, the development of preliminary studies through feasibility report development; engineering design through detailed plans, specifications; design/build request for proposal packages; design analysis/design documentation report preparation; value engineering; cost estimates, technical and bid-ability, constructability, operability, environmental, and sustainability (BCOES) reviews; real estate acquisition support; engineering during construction; and construction phase services for the Freeport levee system improvements and ecosystem restoration. The A-E may also be required to participate in teams executing projects through alternative methods of delivery that include, but are not limited to, early contractor involvement, pre-qualification of sources, etc.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for A-E services with a total capacity of $72M.</p>
<p>Selection of the A-E firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only the firm considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. A single award will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of eight (8) years, which includes a four (4) year base period and two (2) two-year options. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $72,000,000 over the eight-year life of the contract.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years. All interested Other than Small Business A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, compliance with FAR 52.219-9 is required, which includes a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. This plan will be submitted for review during the contract negotiation phase.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay is located along the upper Texas coast, comprising the coastlines of six counties: Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, Jefferson, Chambers and Orange. The project covers a 120-mile stretch of the upper Texas coast along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from the Texas/Louisiana border at Sabine Pass in the east, to the western end of Galveston Island at San Luis Pass in the southwest. The project area includes Gulf and bay waters, barrier islands, marshes, coastal wetlands, rivers and streams and adjacent areas that make up the interrelated coastal area. Critical coastal ecosystems including sea turtle nesting habitat, piping plover critical habitat as well as two state and Federal wildlife refuges are within the project area. This region is home to more than five million people and is a major economic hub for Houston (Nation's fourth largest city), Freeport, Beaumont, and Port Arthur. Three of the Nation's top ten deep-draft ports, and 40 percent of the Nation's petrochemical industry lies within the project's footprint. In the entire study area, over 200 houses and up to 40,000 people are affected by shore erosion. This reach of the upper Texas coastal zone is at risk from wind and surge damage during storm events. The area has experienced significant shoreline erosion causing the destruction of nationally significant wetlands, loss of land and damage to homes, commercial property, and State Highway 87. Over the last ten years, the entire area was significantly altered both physically and economically causing billions in damages.</p>
<p>A "new start" feasibility study was performed to evaluate alternatives to address the problems identified, and the final study recommendations were approved by the Chief of Engineers on 7 December 2017. The recommended plan consists of three Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) measures: 1) Orange, which includes a new levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, pump stations, drainage structures, and closure gates); 2) Port Arthur (and vicinity), which includes improvements and extension to an existing levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, and closure gates); and 3) Freeport (and vicinity), which includes improvements to an existing levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, closure gates, drainage structures, pump station, and navigable sector gate). These three CSRM measures each function as independent systems. This SATOC is to support the design and implementation of the Freeport levee system improvements and ecosystem restoration. The Freeport system includes, but is not limited to, raising 13.1 miles of the existing earthen levee system, constructing/reconstructing approximately 5.5 miles of floodwall, constructing ten vehicle closure structures at road and railroad crossings, constructing various drainage structures, raising the Highway 332 crossing, providing additional capacity to an existing pump station, and installing a navigable sector gate. Services will be implemented with negotiated, firm fixed price (FFP) task orders (TOs) in the magnitude of $1M to $25M, unless approved by the Contracting Officer up to the capacity of the SATOC.</p>
<p>According to the Director's Policy Memorandum for Civil Works 2018-09, Principals of Delivery for the 2018 Emergency Supplemental, delivery targets were established for the completion of any necessary investigations, analyses, engineering, and design is one year with a target to complete all construction by January 2022 for construction less than $100M, January 2023 for construction ranging from $100 Million to $500 Million, and January 2024 for construction greater than $500 Million. As the feasibility study cost estimate for the Freeport levee system was $606 Million, SWG will be held to meeting these delivery targets.</p>

<p>Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E Services for this contract include, but are not limited to, survey, investigations, comprehensive planning, technical analysis, modeling, engineering, design, construction phase services, and any necessary project and technical requirements that support the design and implementation of the project features. Capabilities include, but are not limited to, the development of preliminary studies through feasibility report development; engineering design through detailed plans, specifications; design/build request for proposal packages; design analysis/design documentation report preparation; value engineering; cost estimates, technical and bid-ability, constructability, operability, environmental, and sustainability (BCOES) reviews; real estate acquisition support; engineering during construction; and construction phase services for the Freeport levee system improvements and ecosystem restoration. The A-E may also be required to participate in teams executing projects through alternative methods of delivery that include, but are not limited to, early contractor involvement, pre-qualification of sources, etc.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for A-E services with a total capacity of $72M.</p>
<p>Selection of the A-E firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only the firm considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. A single award will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of eight (8) years, which includes a four (4) year base period and two (2) two-year options. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $72,000,000 over the eight-year life of the contract.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years. All interested Other than Small Business A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, compliance with FAR 52.219-9 is required, which includes a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. This plan will be submitted for review during the contract negotiation phase.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay is located along the upper Texas coast, comprising the coastlines of six counties: Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, Jefferson, Chambers and Orange. The project covers a 120-mile stretch of the upper Texas coast along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from the Texas/Louisiana border at Sabine Pass in the east, to the western end of Galveston Island at San Luis Pass in the southwest. The project area includes Gulf and bay waters, barrier islands, marshes, coastal wetlands, rivers and streams and adjacent areas that make up the interrelated coastal area. Critical coastal ecosystems including sea turtle nesting habitat, piping plover critical habitat as well as two state and Federal wildlife refuges are within the project area. This region is home to more than five million people and is a major economic hub for Houston (Nation's fourth largest city), Freeport, Beaumont, and Port Arthur. Three of the Nation's top ten deep-draft ports, and 40 percent of the Nation's petrochemical industry lies within the project's footprint. In the entire study area, over 200 houses and up to 40,000 people are affected by shore erosion. This reach of the upper Texas coastal zone is at risk from wind and surge damage during storm events. The area has experienced significant shoreline erosion causing the destruction of nationally significant wetlands, loss of land and damage to homes, commercial property, and State Highway 87. Over the last ten years, the entire area was significantly altered both physically and economically causing billions in damages.</p>
<p>A "new start" feasibility study was performed to evaluate alternatives to address the problems identified, and the final study recommendations were approved by the Chief of Engineers on 7 December 2017. The recommended plan consists of three Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) measures: 1) Orange, which includes a new levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, pump stations, drainage structures, and closure gates); 2) Port Arthur (and vicinity), which includes improvements and extension to an existing levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, and closure gates); and 3) Freeport (and vicinity), which includes improvements to an existing levee system (floodwalls, earthen levee, closure gates, drainage structures, pump station, and navigable sector gate). These three CSRM measures each function as independent systems. This SATOC is to support the design and implementation of the Freeport levee system improvements and ecosystem restoration. The Freeport system includes, but is not limited to, raising 13.1 miles of the existing earthen levee system, constructing/reconstructing approximately 5.5 miles of floodwall, constructing ten vehicle closure structures at road and railroad crossings, constructing various drainage structures, raising the Highway 332 crossing, providing additional capacity to an existing pump station, and installing a navigable sector gate. Services will be implemented with negotiated, firm fixed price (FFP) task orders (TOs) in the magnitude of $1M to $25M, unless approved by the Contracting Officer up to the capacity of the SATOC.</p>
<p>According to the Director's Policy Memorandum for Civil Works 2018-09, Principals of Delivery for the 2018 Emergency Supplemental, delivery targets were established for the completion of any necessary investigations, analyses, engineering, and design is one year with a target to complete all construction by January 2022 for construction less than $100M, January 2023 for construction ranging from $100 Million to $500 Million, and January 2024 for construction greater than $500 Million. As the feasibility study cost estimate for the Freeport levee system was $606 Million, SWG will be held to meeting these delivery targets.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to update the Statement of Work within the RFQ and provide responses to questions received.

Paragraph 5.c of the Statement of Work is hereby changed to read   The veterans will verify reservations within 24 hours of check-in date/time.

Question and Answers:
Question #1: In the Statement of Work, 5.0 General section, item C it notes:
c. The Veterans upon scheduling an appointment will be informed by SLCVAHCS staff, to immediately call the assigned hotel/motel to verify reservations. The Contractor will hold a room for the Veteran in accordance with their standard reservation process.
It is our understanding from the SOW that SLCVAHCS will send the reservation requests to the contractor we are to return to the VA a confirmation number confirming the reservation. The hotel process usually takes a few hours up to 24 hours to complete unless the reservation is urgent. If the veterans are immediately calling the hotel to confirm their reservations when an appointment is made with the VA, this will create confusion at the hotel level. If the hotel has not received and processed the reservation request, the veterans will be calling the VA back to inquire as to why the hotel is not confirming their reservation. Our hotels will not confirm any reservation without first receiving a request from the contractor and issuing a confirmation number. The hotels will be sub-contractors to the contractor and all charges will run through the contractor; therefore, the hotels will not be allowed to accept reservation request from anyone other than approved VA representatives and the contractor. Veterans will not be allowed to make their own reservation directly with the hotel unless they are securing payment for the reservation. While we advise the veterans to confirm with the hotel,  immediately  trying to confirm a reservation after the VA appointment will only create wasted man hours for the veteran, the VA and the hotel. Is it possible to alter this timeline?

Answer 1: Reference above SOW change.

Question #2: I submitted a bid on an earlier solicitation, 36C25919Q0574. Are these two solicitations related? Does the one released today replace the older one? What about the bids that were submitted on behalf of the first one?

Answer 2: Solicitation 36C25919Q0574 was cancelled and replaced by 36C25920Q0013. Any bids received for 36C25919Q0574 will need to be updated with the new requirements and resubmitted under 36C25920Q0013.

Question #3: Will the VA accept two different hotel properties, one for the Standard and one for the Transplant? Or would you prefer one property to address both?

Answer #3: Quotes received must meet the requirements as stated in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.c of the Statement of Work.

Question #4: In regard to Solicitation Number: 36C25920Q0013 for the hotel lodging does the government need 56 rooms or 30 guaranteed rooms? 

Answer 4: Quotes received must meet the requirements as stated in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.c of the Statement of Work.

Question #5: Was there a previous incumbent? If there was a previous incumbent what was the award number? 

Answer #5: 36C25918N3750; 36C25919N0041; 36C25918N3757

Question #6: Does the patients lodging have to have shuttle services? 

Answer #6: Quotes received must meet the requirements as stated in Section 7 of the Statement of Work.

Question #7: Will you provide a tax exemption certificate to the awarded contractor?

Answer #7: A tax-exempt certificate will be provided to the awardee.

Question #8: Does a prospective contractor have the option to submit a proposal offering accommodations for the Transplant Patients only or is it mandatory to submit for both the Standard Patients and Transplant Patients?

Answer #8: No.  In accordance with paragraph vii(a), 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors,  Any award made as a result of this solicitation will be made on an All or Nothing Basis. 

Question #9: The Statement of work request a daily minimum of 56 rooms for standard patients and 30 rooms for transplant patients with unreserved rooms being released by 5:00pm daily, based on actual rooms rented over previous years what are the actual number of rooms utilized on a daily basis?

Answer #9: The room requirements at each location are derived directly from the usage of the last five years.

Question #10: The Statement of Work does not identify a number of ADA rooms required for the Transplant Patient, is there a required number?

Answer #10: There is no requirement for ADA rooms in section 3.2

Question #11: How many days of occupancy is expected for each room rental? 

Answer #11: That number cannot be calculated as each veteran stay is unique to that veteran s needs.

Question #12: Is transportation to and from the medical facility mandatory, if so shouldn t there be a separate line item for transportation costs since most Hotels offer shuttle service to the airport?

Answer #12: Quotes received must meet the requirements as stated in Section 7 of the Statement of Work. No separate line item required. 


Question #13: If transportation is mandatory, how many trips per day is required and how many patients are to be transported? 
Answer #13: The Government has no way of knowing how often the shuttle will be needed each day.  The veterans will be responsible to coordinate shuttle rides with the hotel.
Attachment 1 is a mandatory document.
D. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">PROPRIETARY INFORMATION:</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this market survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under Federal Acquisition Regulation 3.104-4 (18 U.S.C. &sect;1905) to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (excessive breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting, or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate, when only portions of an electronic file are proprietary, use the restrictive legends "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this market survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under Federal Acquisition Regulation 3.104-4 (18 U.S.C. &sect;1905) to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (excessive breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting, or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate, when only portions of an electronic file are proprietary, use the restrictive legends "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</span></p>

The COI-SCC concepts incorporate performance based supply chain management and logistics support in order to maximize the effectiveness of the contract and further expand the breadth of support provided by PHC in aid of DLA's objective to seek holistic logistics solutions. PBL support will enable the DoD to buy a level of support from PHC to support any one of its sole source end-items. A level of support is being used as a general term because it can vary depending on each requirement. <br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br /><br />Initiatives will involve identifying demand patterns and emergent needs for parts in various federal supply classes (FSC) which are only manufactured by PHC, and to place those items on contract through one of the three identified methods (Standard Consumable and DLR Spare Parts Support, COI-SCC or PBL Support) as demand warrants. As the program matures, and projects relating to the COI-SCC and PBL increments are more clearly identified, market research will be performed to ensure these subsequent phases are sole source to PHC.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br /><br />PURPOSE: DLA desires to issue multiple contracts to Parker-Hannifin Corporation Aerospace and Industrial business entities to transform the existing / legacy contracts to COI-SCC and PBL projects to expand follow-on support.

Airport Technology Research & Development Contract Strategy Industry Day 


The FAA William J Hughes Technical Center is planning an Industry Day on December 3, 2019 to discuss the acquisition strategy relative to the Airport Technology Research and Development (ATRD) program. 


For those interested in supporting the ATRD program, the Industry Day will provide information on the revised approach the FAA has adopted in procuring the services needed to support this program. 


Historically, support for ATRD has been procured primarily through one multi-year contract vehicle. In recent years, the ATRD portfolio has become more diverse and complex. This requires a new approach to effectively support the program. The FAA has identified distinct functional areas, programs, or projects that may be supported separately through various contract mechanisms. The various facets of this program and the specific acquisition strategies intended to be applied to each will be discussed.  


You are invited to join us to hear about the many new opportunities available to industry and academia to support this historically budgeted $33 Million a year program.  


Tours of the ATRD buildings and labs will take place in the afternoon to allow prospective bidders on future procurement opportunities to view the facilities. 


For additional information on the ATRD program, please visit their website:  https://www.airporttech.tc.faa.gov/

<DESC>The U.S. Forest Service, Incident Support Branch at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, ID is soliciting for the National Mobile Food Services for fire suppression activities, all-hazard incidents and severity/preparedness assignments. Attached is the complete Solicitation and the Specifications Compliance Matrix (Excel Spreadsheet) required to be included with an Offeror's proposal.

Each Exclusive Use awardee is annually guaranteed orders equal to the amount of $1,000 per day for each MFSU for each day of MAP. The potential to be awarded Call When Needed (CWN) units are included in the same solicitation. CWN units may be awarded as a separate line item on an Offeror's contract provided the Offeror receives an award at one of the DDPs, has offered additional units that meet the specifications and has indicated these units are to be considered for a CWN line item if they do not receive an award for additional DDPs.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Amendment 01: Question Posed by Industry<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span></strong>&nbsp;Provide some clarification as to the requirements of this RFI. There seems to be some conflict between the title of the RFI and the actual requirement, regarding ballistic protection (BPP). Moreover there are no requirements identified for the BPP, only the CBD.<br /><br />"The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command Chemical Biological Defense and Ballistic Personal Protection (NAVSEA CBD &amp; BPP) Project is seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide an over garment that provides percutaneous protection to the shipboard Sailor from Chemical/Biological (CB) warfare agents and other hazardous materials which may be employed against them to cause injuries."</p>
<p>&nbsp;Can you please clarify if ballistic protection is a requirement (if so at what level), or is it an integration concern with an over garment CBRN suit?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>&nbsp; There is no ballistic personal protection requirement. The reference is limited to the name of a project team to which the Government personnel are assigned. <br /><br />__________________________________________________________________<br /><strong>N61331-20-CH-01<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />FOR<br />NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE &amp; BALLISTIC PERSONAL PROTECTION PROJECT</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.0 Description</strong></p>
<p>1.1 The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command Chemical Biological Defense and Ballistic Personal Protection (NAVSEA CBD &amp; BPP) Project is seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide an overgarment that provides percutaneous protection to the shipboard Sailor from Chemical/Biological (CB) warfare agents and other hazardous materials which may be employed against them to cause injuries. The overgarment shall allow Sailors to perform all necessary tasks without degrading performance or increasing the risk of heat related injuries. NSWC PCD is looking for information on mature fire retardant technology that can be used aboard ship with legacy Chem/Bio protective military masks, gloves and overboots.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Navy is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</span></strong> Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the NAVSEA CBD &amp; BPP project is to ensure that Navy forces have the capability to operate effectively and decisively in the face of CB and Ballistic threats in both warfighter and homeland security missions.</p>
<p>Our equipment is designed, developed, and delivered with the sole purpose of preserving human life. We are committed to providing a rapid and effective response to emerging Navy needs as new risks are identified within a dynamic threat environment - both CONUS and OCONUS. We are committed to providing the best product available and maintain an active role in the product improvement process. We continue to design, develop, and implement enhancements in capability, reductions in total ownership (life cycle) costs and integration of new technology where appropriate.</p>
<p>We ensure that a comprehensive logistics support infrastructure is established and maintained to provide long-term product quality and effectiveness. This includes the delivery, fielding, and training of new products and product improvements. It also includes the refurbishment and retrofit of existing products and evaluation of maintenance and repair procedures. Each activity contributes to our overall goal of promoting the highest level of operator safety.</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for our product line belongs to The Extreme Environment Life Support Branch, within the Maritime Mission Systems Division. Our engineering assignments include all non-aviation personal protection equipment for protection against chemical, biological, radiological threats or against ballistic threats. Our customers include all U.S. Navy afloat and ashore forces.</p>
<p>Protective ensembles are provided to U.S. Navy forward deployed and deploying forces. We ensure that fully serviceable gear is issued to ensure continued operations during increasing Mission Oriented Protective Posture levels and Anti-Terrorism Afloat operations. CBD protective equipment includes protective coats and trousers, boots, gloves, and masks.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Planned Production:</strong></p>
<p>The magnitude of need spans Navy deployers from all Warfare Enterprises and Enabler Commands. Therefore, the total U.S. Navy requirement could be between 250,000 and 600,000.</p>

<DESC><strong>Opportunity:</strong> The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is seeking information from industry, academia, nonprofits, and research institutions on innovative technologies that should be considered as part of the Next Generation Water Observing System (NGWOS) effort ongoing within the USGS.  This includes technologies that strategically enhance the temporal and spatial collection of water quantity, quality, and water-use data in surface and groundwater across the United States.   The data will be served through a modernized USGS National Water Information System that will be coupled to advanced modeling tools to inform daily water operations, decision-making during water emergencies, assessments of past trends in water quantity and quality, and forecasts of future water availability.
<div><br /></div>
<div>NGWOS aims to foster innovation and development of monitoring technologies and methodologies to make data more affordable and more rapidly available. Monitoring innovations also are expected to lead to more types of data at higher temporal and spatial frequencies. The application and benefits of these innovations will extend beyond the NGWOS watersheds and be incorporated into routine operation of USGS monitoring networks.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This Request for Information (RFI) is to help identify promising technologies or interested partners who are capable of jointly developing technologies that can integrate with current USGS research and development per the Stevenson&shy;Wydler Act (15 U.S.C. &sect; 3710a, as amended). Responses to this RFI should briefly describe the proposed technology, including the type of data collected, potential applications for the data, and the technology readiness / product maturity level.  Technologies of interest include but are not limited to:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>- Non-contact sensing for velocity, stage, and water temperature,
<div>
<p>- Long range, low power observation network technologies,</p>
<p>- Instrumentation for monitoring hydrologic budgets (ET, soil moisture, snowpack and water-use),</p>
<p>- New sensors for monitoring continuous water-quality, including sediment, nutrients, contaminants, and environmental DNA,</p>
<p>- Mobile autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and drifters for water quality and flow monitoring,&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Webcams and drone-mounted sensors for operational and science applications,<br />Innovative technologies for detecting and monitoring hazards such as spills and harmful algal blooms (HABs).</p>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. If proprietary information is submitted, clearly mark this information as Confidential. The USGS will protect this information from disclosure if it meets the Federal FOIA exemptions.</p>
<p>The USGS Office of Technology Transfer will host a webinar to provide additional information about NGWOS and technology transfer opportunities on Thursday, November 14th, 2019 from 2:00 to 3:30 ET.
