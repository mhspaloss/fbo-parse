<DESC>NOTICE OF SOLE SOURCE INTENT

This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.

The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office intends to award a purchase order to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game located in Boise, Idaho for the continued management of lands acquired and transferred to the State of Idaho on behalf of Reclamation towards mitigating negative effects of wildlife habitat due to the construction of the Lower Teton Division Project and Mitigation Lands.   Reclamation has found the Idaho Department of Fish and Game the only reasonable source able to successfully complete the required services due to Idaho statute and established cooperative agreements.  

The Teton Mitigation Areas are located in Eastern Idaho and are managed by the State of Idaho and include portions of the Tex Creek Wildlife Management Area (WMA), located to the southeast of Ririe Reservoir; Cartier Slough WMA, located north of Ririe Reservoir; and the Ririe Outlet Channel, located west of Ririe Reservoir. The Resource Management Plan (RMP) supporting this initiative addresses current and anticipated future issues to permit the orderly and coordinated development and management of lands and facilities and the water surface under Reclamation jurisdiction in the RMP area.

The awarded purchase order will be for a base period of 12 months, and include two (2) 12-month option periods.  Reclamation believes that only one responsible source can fully provide the services that will satisfy the agency's requirements.  A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is being prepared.  

The Government anticipates award before July 2020.  Vendors that have questions regarding the sole source nature of the requirement or vendors that believe they can fully provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer listed below within 15 calendar days of this notice. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

Responses to this notice can be mailed to the Bureau of Reclamation ¿ SRA-7127; 230 Collins Road, Boise, ID 83702 or e-mailed to asomerville@usbr.gov.  All responses should include the vendor's Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) Number and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  The NAICS code for this effort is 924120. No small business size standard is established for this Sector 92 Public Administration Sector.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  

Any contractor interested in doing business with the Federal Government must register in the System for Award Management database prior to submission of an offer.  SAM is a Federal Government owned and operated FREE website at www.beta.sam.gov. 

All invoices for this procurement must be submitted through the Department of Treasury's Invoice Processing Platform located at www.ipp.gov.
