This is anticipated to be a sole source award to Comcast Communications LLC, as their pricing is the most advantageous to the Government due to loyalty program pricing and incentives. In addition, cancelling the current accounts would nearly double service costs and increase installation charges with a new vendor. Finally, the vast geographic parameters for service covers Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska, and Comcast is the only provider that can service the entire area.

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistic Center San Diego – Seal Beach Detachment intends to issue a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 to ANSYS Inc, 2600 ANSYS Drive, Canonsburg, PA 15317. The proposed contract action is for a license and a license renewal for NAVFAC’s Mooring Analysis equipment currently in place.   

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and as implemented under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

The AQWA Suite software is proprietary to ANSYS and is currently installed as NAVFAC EXWC’s primary tool for required to continue its mooring design and analysis which is tasked to NAVFAC EXWC directly by Navy Expeditionary Program Office (NEPO).
 Updated licenses are required annually to ensure all software is operating optimally and the Navy receives the most accurate data for analysis.  Changing NAVFAC EXWC’s INLS support and planning software would require an entire overhaul of existing systems and require exorbitant man-hours of system engineering, putting operational NAVFAC EXWS and NEPO capabilities and accuracies at risk. Accordingly, ANSYS is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this software.  

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and as implemented under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

The STK and ODK software is proprietary to AGI is currently installed on the NAVSOC Orbital Analysis System (OAS) and is used to perform orbital determination, predict exact location of the satellites, provide on-orbit event timelines and to plan maneuvers for collision avoidance.
NAVSOC has engineered applications and interfaces to work directly with STK and together with ODK are critical to NAVSOC Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  License renewals and patch updates are required to keep this software in use, up to date and accurate.  Changing NAVSOCs orbital analysis software would require an entire overhaul of existing systems and require exorbitant man-hours of system engineering putting operational satellites at risk due to loss of orbital analysis and collision avoidance capabilities. Accordingly, AGI is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this software.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(a)  This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld.  If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) in accordance with FAR 33.103.  A protest to ECC-A is a “PROTEST TO THE AGENCY,” within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ECC-A Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ECC-A, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.

(b)  An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the ECC-A Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by ECC-A.  Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:

(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)  The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)  An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.

(c)  An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests.

(d) For the purpose of filing a ECC-A Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 

(e)  An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the Contracting Officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.

(f)  ECC-A Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from Mrs. Charlene Wilson @ Charlene.wilson.civ@mail.mil 
(End of Clause)<BR><BR>MANDATORY ELIGIBILITY FOR INSTALLATION ACCESS
(OCT 2015)

(a)   U.S. and Coalition Commanders possess inherent authority to maintain law and order, provide security, and impose discipline necessary to protect the inhabitants of U.S. and/or Coalition installations, U.S. and Coalition personnel operating outside of installations, and U.S. or Coalition-funded developmental projects in Afghanistan.  This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts – including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site.  A commander’s inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agency’s contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision.

(b)  The prime Contractor/Vendor acknowledges that:  submission of a bid, offer, or a proposal; acceptance of contract award of any type; or continuing effort under any contract that includes this clause; requires that the prime Contractor/Vendor, and all subcontractors under any affected contracts be initially eligible – and remain eligible during the entire period of contract performance to include any warrant period – for installation access to a U.S. and/or Coalition installation, regardless of whether the performance will take place on or off a U.S. or Coalition installation.<BR><BR>Document entitled, "Shipping Instructions" is for shipping thru Dover.  Clause entitled, "5251.225-5914 Commodity Shipping Instructions is for vendors outside of the United States shipping directly to Afghanistan.<BR><BR>

 Evaluations of Options (July 1990) 

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. This includes options under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation.  Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(End of Clause)

a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 60 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.

(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
