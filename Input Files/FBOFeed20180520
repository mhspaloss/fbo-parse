<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO 2) intends to award a sole source contract to Cannon Design, 360 Madison Avenue 11th Floor, New York City, New York 10017 under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253-c-1, as implemented in FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. 

Cannon Design is to modify and update the completed designs from a major Office of Construction & Facilities Management (CFM) Project for a new non-recurring maintenance project at the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System Manhattan Campus and to furnish all necessary labor to provide construction period services (CPS). 

Period of Performance: The period of performance is 180 calendar days from award notice.

This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; interested parties may express their interest by providing a capabilities statement no later than Monday, 04 June 2018 at 11:00 AM EST. The capabilities statement must provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate the capability of the party to provide the required services.   A determination not to compete this proposed requirement upon receipt of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered.  After 04 June 2018, at 2:00 PM EST, if no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, Department of Veterans Affairs shall negotiate solely with Cannon Design.

Cannon Design will update the previously prepared designs and provide Construction Period Services for this non-recurring maintenance project. Cannon Design has unique capabilities to provide the Government s requirement within a timely and practical manner.  The Government believes that it would be highly unusual for another design professional to take on the aforementioned responsibilities, which are generally incidental to an overall agreement for preparation of plans and specification.   

In the scope of work, A/E professional services are required to include the executive summary reports, contract drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and construction period services for the VA NYHHCS at 423 East 23rd Street, New York, NY for the following items, but not limited to:

All rooms will be converted into single patient rooms to meet the VA s guidelines to provide patient privacy.  Meet with clinical staff to determine the needs of the different units and functions.  Gut renovation will require some of the following: expand step down unit to, provide separate nurse s station satellite pixus type with open floor view of all rooms if possible, all rooms separated by glass partitions with curtains for privacy, the rest of the wing will be renovated for patient use, provide an ante room for isolation rooms, Med room, more storage, main nurse s station, new lights, ceiling, floors, doors and hardware, paint, hand rails, cove base, bedside computers, TV s, nurse call system, MEP, phasing plans (including swing space), commissioning, architectural plans with furniture, fixture and equipment plans and layouts,  etc. Provide services of CIH (if applicable) for asbestos abatement documents, sampling, air monitoring, drawings, A/E must meet and survey the nurses to meet their needs and concerns.

The point of contact for this action is Ms. Mitchelle Labady, Contract Specialist at Mitchelle.Labady@va.gov.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.</p>
<p>1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver. <br />52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal (AUG 1999)<br />1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />(a) The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting<br />3. Identify constraints in transparency<br />(b) The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />(c) Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />(d)There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&not;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates).<br />2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the S. Government.<br />7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013)</p>
