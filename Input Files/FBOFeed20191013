<CONTACT>Michael C. Bonds, Contracting Officer, Phone 2022578893, Email michael.bonds@fema.dhs.gov
<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<ARCHDATE>10172019
<DESC><p>1. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>Provide engineered temporary wall manufactured by Swiftwall Solutions, Inc. This includes 39 each 8 foot walls with 3x3 windows, 6 each 12 foot single door with windows, 38 each 10 foot c-channel, tapes and screws.</p>
<p>2. JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLICITING A BRAND NAME</p>
<p>FEMA recently purchased and installed Swiftwall temporary panels. The new requirement would attach and/or install with the current temporary panels. In order to properly install the new panels to the current Swiftwall panels, it requires brand name materials. The material is proprietary by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>3. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Market research indicated retailers able to compete for the brand name. The brand name contains proprietary information. Market research did not indicate temporary panels compatibility and to purchase other walls may damage current walls in place. It would not be full competition, but competition can still occur among retailers.</p>
<p>4. STEPS TO PRECLUDE FUTURE BRAND NAME AWARDS</p>
<p>The plan includes adding the &lsquo;increase quantity' option with the current award to ensure we capture future requirements while properly identifying what the requirement currently is. The government cannot do anything in reference to proprietary information but walls that do not attached to current walls can be competed full and open.</p>
<p>5. OTHER FACTORS: N/A</p>
<p>6. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S DETERMINATION<br />I have determined, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), that the circumstances of this contract action deem only a brand name is reasonably available.</p>
