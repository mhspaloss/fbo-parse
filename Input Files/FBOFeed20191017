<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Freight on Board (FOB) will be at Origin and Inspection/Acceptance will be at Destination. The proposed procurement will be a Long Term Contract (LTC). The duration of the contract will be for a total of three (3) years, consisting of one (1) base year, and two (2) option years. The option years may be exercised at the discretion of the Government. The required delivery is 150 days. The Procurement Item Description (PID) for this NSN can be found at the bottom of this document.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is using the policies contained in FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation - in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.</p>
<p>This will be solicited as a Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside. The solicitation will be posted to the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp/default.aspx on or about November 5, 2019. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: Offers/Responses will be due prior to the closing date and time specified in Block 9 of Page 1 of Standard Form 33 (Solicitation, Offer and Award). All responsible sources may submit an offer/proposal, which shall be considered.</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, and past performance, as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>* Acquisition Method Code (AMC) / Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMSC) Description:<br />&bull; AMC 1: Suitable for competitive acquisition for the second or subsequent time.<br />&bull; AMSC B: This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STO CS001 - Export Control</p>
<p>This item has technical data some or all of which is subject to export-control of either the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and cannot be exported without the authorization of either the Department of State or the Department of Commerce prior to export. Export includes disclosure of technical data to foreign nationals whether located in the United States or abroad. This requirement applies equally to foreign national employees or U.S. companies and their foreign subsidiaries.</p>
<p>DLA has enhanced its Joint Certification Program (JCP) registration and validation procedures. Selected National Stock Numbers (NSNs) will require additional permissions to access the associated technical data. In the event a vendor cannot access the technical data for a NSN in DLA cFolders, the vendor must submit a onetime request to jcpvalidation@dla.mil for technical data access consideration. If a vendor has inquiries after having submitted required information to the JCP office, these inquiries are to be directed to DLAJ344DataCustodian@dla.mil.</p>
<p>DLA processes the vendor's technical data request on a first come, first served basis. Failure to comply timely with required information may result in lack of consideration for DLA solicitations. It is vitally important that vendors provide correct company official name(s) and contact information in all correspondence. DLA will work diligently on validating vendor requests. Vendors will be notified within 3 business days of when their requests were approved. However, DLA cannot guarantee that it can complete all validation requests by the due date for any solicitation responses</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">L08 Use of Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) in Past Performance Evaluations (APR 2018)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) (https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil) (formerly Past</p>
<p>Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR)) will be used in the</p>
<p>evaluation of suppliers' past performance.</p>
<p>(2) SPRS collects quality and delivery data on previously awarded contracts and orders from existing</p>
<p>Department of Defense reporting systems to classify each supplier's performance history by Federal</p>
<p>supply class (FSC) and product or service code (PSC). The SPRS application provides the contracting</p>
<p>officer quantifiable past performance information regarding a supplier's quality and delivery performance</p>
<p>for the FSC and PSC of the supplies being purchased.</p>
<p>(3) The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in SPRS will be used by the contracting</p>
<p>officer to evaluate a supplier's past performance in conjunction with the supplier's references (if requested).</p>
<p>The Government will use this past performance information in accordance with the basis for award stated</p>
<p>in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(4) SPRS classifications are generated daily, Monday through Friday, for each contractor and can be</p>
<p>reviewed by following the access instructions in the User's Manual found at</p>
<p>https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/pdf/PPIRS-SR_UserMan.pdf. Contractors are granted access to SPRS for</p>
<p>their own classifications only. Suppliers are encouraged to review their own classifications, the SPRS reporting</p>
<p>procedures and classification methodology detailed in the User's Manual, and SPRS Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>available from the references at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/pdf/SPRS_DataEvaluationCriteria.pdf. The</p>
<p>method to challenge a rating generated by SPRS is provided in the User's Manual.</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited. <br /><br />The 421st Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or Presolicitation Conference. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No qualification requirements exist. Consequently, potential sources for this effort typically would be companies who have a license or agreement with the Original Equipment Manufacturer General Electric, Cage: 99207 to complete the work described, including military specific modifications. <br /><br />The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336412, which has a corresponding Size Standard of 1,000 employees.

Statement of Work
Glass Marker Boards

Background:
Patient boards help bridge the communication gap between the patient and care team that often reduces the quality of patient satisfaction and care. Patient satisfaction is largely dependent upon how well hospital staff communicates with them. Patients often feel doctors and nurses are lax in explaining things, such as their care plan, medication schedule and procedure dates in a satisfactory manner. By placing a patient board in the hospital room, nursing staff will have a way to write down important information that needs to be communicated to their patients. 
Scope:
The VAMC would like to purchase sixty-five (65) 24 x32  vertical, fully-changeable glass patient boards with American flag background.
Product Details:
Tempered glass with polished edges
Size: 24 x32  vertical
Custom selected graphics on changeable insert
Insert options on both sides
Easy to clean (non-staining/non-ghosting surface)
Resists bacterial growth
Safe for all disinfectants

Period of Performance:
Order shall be delivered no later than 8 weeks after award of contract.
Northport VAMC shall coordinate with Contractor to install boards upon receipt.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />Public Affairs Program Office, Sales and Marketing Services
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Armed Forces Retirement Home, is an independent entity in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. The Office of the Chief Operating Officer is seeking information on how an interested contractor could support and fulfill the goals and strategies of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in its need to expand sales and marketing outcomes and expand brand recognition.</p>
<p>On a backdrop of historical richness and national significance, combined with an endearing mission, the AFRH is experiencing unprecedented vacancies. Although there existed valid reasons for declines in occupancy over the past several years, we have learned that so many, including the active military who's every paycheck withholds and contributes 50 cents to our operations, don't know the opportunity that this place represents for them in their retirement.</p>
<p>We need to increase and stabilize occupancy to sustain the future of this landmark treasure, its Trust Fund, and for those who do and will call it "home". In addition, in FY2019, Congress gave AFHR the ability, through legislation, to actively recruit and engage the donor community and seek gifts to support the long-term strategies, growth, and sustainability for the future.</p>
<p>The absence of good branding, advertising, print and digital media, national and local news, communications, sales, and other elements of sales and marketing and a plan that will give us the coverage and results we seek will keep us in the dark. Without a plan and an action, those who need us will not be able to find us, and those who want to contribute and support our veterans will also not be able to find us or recognize what we represent. We are not the experts in this Sales and Marketing arena, so we are trying to gather information associated with sales and marketing services so that the AFRH can map to a results oriented, time-sensitive effort to make tomorrow happen today.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Agency is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in accordance with the FAR and the appropriate acquisition strategy. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) is a small, independent agency in the Executive branch of the United States Government. AFRH provides residences and related services for certain (reference Exhibit 1) retired and former members of the Armed Forces (24 U.S. Code 10, Subchapter 411), with two Campuses for residents in Gulfport and DC.</p>
<p>Washington DC Campus: Intended to be a sanctuary for our soldiers, the facility was known as the U.S. Soldier's Home from 1859 to 1972 and as the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home from 1972 to 2001. It has been known as the Armed Forces Retirement Home-Washington since 2001. Founded by General Scott (1786-1866) who said, "If there is anyone who deserves to have his pathway made smooth and pleasant, it is the old soldier who was ever ready to sacrifice his life in defense of his country." The DC location is on a 272-acre historic campus in the heart of Washington DC and is also home to President Lincoln's Cottage.</p>
<p>The Naval Home in Gulfport, Mississippi: Overlooking the Mississippi Sound and its beaches, is also part of the AFRH, and at its origin, intended as a safe haven for our seamen: "A comfortable harbor will be secured, where he may safely moor and ride out the ebb of life, free from the cares and storms ... " Commodore William Bainbridge, (Naval Home cornerstone laying, April 3, 1827).</p>
<p>The United States Congress established the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) as a separate federal agency in 1991 when it enacted the Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 101-510. Although AFRH is a Federal Agency it does not generally receive tax payer funds to operate the Home. AFRH's source of income flows from the enlisted men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States through a small payroll deduction and fines or forfeitures, from the residents themselves at a subsidized price, and from other sources of revenue like property leases and revenue-sharing. In 2019, Congress gave the Agency the ability to directly solicit funds through gifts and donations to help ensure the sustainability of its Fund and the future of the Home for America's soldiers, the defenders of our Freedom.</p>
<p>While the total number of residents varies from month-to-month, AFRH is able to provide a home for approximately 937 (at capacity) former enlisted personnel in their retirement years in independent living quarters at both the Gulfport and Washington campuses. Approximately 200 other residents are cared for and housed in Assisted Living through Long Term Care. A 95% occupancy goal means that we are able to accommodate a home for about 180 additional retired veterans, between both DC and Gulfport, who can be supported in independent living. Full occupancy is our objective. The AFRH provides retired veterans with the common daily living needs such as: private rooms, bank, chapel, convenience store, mail room, laundry facilities, barber/beauty shop, dining facility, and a 24-hour security and staff presence. In addition to these core needs, AFRH offers social, recreational, and occupational activities to address the diverse needs and interests of the residents who live here. AFRH also provides for residents' overall health care needs including on site primary care, medical care, and a continuum of long-term care services as residents transition away from independent living.</p>
<p>Our residents found it to be an honor to serve our country. AFRH finds it to be an honor to serve them now.</p>
<p>2.1 Plans and Strategies:</p>
<p>a. Retired enlisted service members and more.</p>
<p>The landscape is changing and so should we. The expectations of our World War II veterans and what home looks like is different than the expectations from younger residents who come from other war theaters of service, so our marketing audience is changing. Resident demographics is included as Exhibit 2 to this document. AFRH is the only Federal entity operating what is known in the private sector senior living industry as a continuing care retirement community (CCRC), meaning residential facilities with a continuum of care levels so residents can "age in place" as their physical and health needs change. Our vision, however, is that rather than a traditional Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) which focuses on senior living, AFRH hopes to evolve to become a living community for enlisted veterans of all ages, including those recently completing the Wounded Warrior program, that come to live a vibrant, active life, with services and amenities for all adults and their visiting families. In FY19 we added a policy to enable and incentivize the inclusion of spouses to help revitalize the community.</p>
<p>b. Occupancy</p>
<p>The impact of Hurricane Katrina at Gulfport and multiple other factors since that time have contributed to reduced occupancy levels over time, particularly at the DC Campus. Although we have picked up momentum by focusing on advertising and marketing our objective is to increase current levels of around 70% to 95% occupancy within one year at both Campuses. We need to optimize media to maximize results.<br />c. National and Local Visibility - our Brand</p>
<p>The AFRH is a historic national treasure, by its presence in the community, the historical significance of its buildings and locations, and through those it serves. Each Campus even includes its own museum and Hall of Honors. If you ask those who now work here, they will tell you "I have driven past and had no idea what this was and how special this is". And if you ask so many that serve in the military, they will say "I did not know what the 50 cents charged on my paycheck was for". And when you ask those residents that are here, they will tell you "I am home". So many do not know AFRH exists.</p>
<p>An organization as indebted to and founded on a legacy of service, AFRH represents a tremendous opportunity for partnerships and sponsorships as we build National presence and visibility. We believe in the power of what and who we represent.</p>
<p>d. Marketing Strategy:</p>
<p>We currently run advertisements through print media advertising in major veterans' magazines (VFW, American Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America, etc.), we have published brochures and are in the final stages of updating our website. We also recently added Facebook as another tool. We intend to combine our efforts in print media to include a digital presence, television, news, etc. to not only market the opportunity that this Home represents to former enlisted military to fulfill the goals to increase occupancy, but to also create brand identity/awareness, and to inform/make aware the larger donor community about who we are and what we represent. We need to move from traditional print media to emerging media. <br />e. Target Audience:</p>
<p>A resident can only enter under the independent living category and must pass medical eligibility requirements. The average age of residents as of last year was 83; however, this is already starting to change. Staff has estimated that our current approach targets age populations at 78 to 82, and we wish to move the age demographic down ideally at 68 to 78, optimistically as we continue to evolve at 60 to 68, and beyond if we succeed in removing the minimum age requirement of 60 through legislation. We are also seeking to make the Home a safe haven for wounded warriors and others that have defended our freedom by their service and sacrifice. We need to move from yesterday to tomorrow.</p>
<p>f. Customer relationship management (CRM):</p>
<p>It is important that the technology used by a sales and marketing partner supports, integrates or otherwise provides or supports CRM requirements and objectives. We have to learn how to integrate what we currently do with following up on and engaging with &lsquo;sales leads". We need to organize, automate, and synchronize every facet of customer interaction through sales and marketing in order to increase occupancy. That likely involves the analysis of customer interactions from marketing through eligibility and admission and perhaps beyond in a way that can support our occupancy goals. We need to ensure a calculated path and demonstrate quantifiable success as stewards of our funding resources.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period: TBD</p>
<p>Options may include demographic goals (lowering age requirements if approved by legislature, for example) or occupancy objectives like generating a waiting list.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>

<SOLNBR>RFI-001017
<RESPDATE>121719
<CONTACT>Jerry D. Varnell, Contracting Officer, Phone 2562132573, Email jdvarnell@fbi.gov
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of businesses to provide a service, maintenance and repair contract for respiratory equipment. The Government intends to award a contract under a separate solicitation, but with this notice, the FBI wants to obtain capabilities, delivery, or other market information for planning purposes. All interested, capable, and responsible parties are encouraged to submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p>The Technical Hazards Response Unit (THRU) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has a requirement for a service, maintenance and repair contract for respiratory equipment to maintain current and future equipment in a state of readiness. Responses to this RFI will be used to formulate final requirements for a service, maintenance and repair contract and to identify qualified manufacturers and vendors capable of meeting those requirements. The description below outlines preliminary requirements envisioned for the service, maintenance and repair contract. Respondents should identify their capabilities that would help fulfill the currently envisioned service, maintenance and repair contract requirements as well as any alternative ideas that would improve current concepts. The information gathered will be used to formulate final requirements, which will subsequently be posted in a solicitation for competitive bids.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The THRU is a rapid deployment asset of the FBI that frequently responds to major crisis sites and special events.  THRU provides site safety, technical and hazardous materials operational capabilities for a number of FBI units. THRU is responsible for developing and maintaining the Bureaus capabilities for the collection of evidence during terrorism events that involves operating in environments that contain hazardous materials, toxic industrial chemicals, biological agents, and /or radiological isotopes.  The THRU is continuously in the process of training and equipping Bureau personnel, field wide, to respond to these types of high hazard crime scenes.  The work within the unit is highly technical, and requires the Hazardous Material Responders to be equipped with high quality, respiratory equipment.</p>
<p>Respiratory equipment is distributed and housed in 56 Field offices throughout the United States to include Hawaii and Puerto Rico and three Operational Response Centers (ORC) located in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Irving, Texas and Northridge, California.</p>
<p>Personnel from the Technical Hazards Response Unit can be activated 365 days a year at any given time and must have the required respiratory equipment to perform the required mission and for the safety of THRU personnel and others.  Because of this requirement, THRU is requesting a vendor to be able to provide the service, maintenance and repair to its respiratory equipment in a timely matter throughout the contract period.</p>
<p>All FBI facilities have FedEx capabilities to ship and receive equipment if applicable.</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The THRU is currently in a transition period from 100% Draeger respiratory equipment to a combination of both Draeger and AVON Protection respiratory equipment. We will have the requirement to be able to provide service, maintenance and repairs on equipment from both manufactures for the first year of performance. On the other consecutive years, THRU will have minimal Draeger equipment and mostly Avon Protection equipment. THRU is also responsible for the hydrostatic testing of cylinders for all of the field offices. Currently, the THRU utilizes a web-based instrument maintenance manager system that tracks all of the respiratory equipment.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The government requests that the contractor or contractors provide the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Certified and qualified personnel to provide service, maintenance, repairs and annual flow testing for the following (off site):<br />o	Draeger BG-4 closed circuit rebreathers (Qty.27)<br />o	Draeger PSS 100 Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (Qty.550)<br />o	Draeger PAS Colt (Qty. 20)<br />o	Avon ST54 Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (Qty.650)<br />o	Draeger RIT pack (Qty.3)<br />&bull;	Certified and qualified personnel to service, maintenance, repairs and hydrostatic testing for the following (off site):<br />o	Draeger 60 minute (breathing air), 4500 psi cylinders (for PSS100 SCBA)<br />o	Draeger 3 liter (breathing air), 2900 psi cylinder ( for Colt SCBA)<br />o	Draeger 2 liter (oxygen), 3000 psi cylinder ( for BG-4)<br />o	Avon 60 minute (breathing air), 4500 psi cylinder (for ST54 SCBA)<br />&bull;	Certified and qualified personnel to provide flow testing of respiratory equipment at the ORC in Fredericksburg, VA once a year. This will include the following, taken from the above totals:<br />o	Draeger BG-4 closed circuit (27)<br />o	Draeger PAS Colt (20)<br />o	Avon ST54 Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (Qty.330)<br />&bull;	Update ReadiTrak tracking system with service, maintenance and repairs.<br />&bull;	All serviced parts must be new Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) parts (with copy of certification provided) and maintain the original printer specifications and warranties <br />&bull;	Requesting a "Pay As You Go" type contract with monthly consolidated invoicing.<br />&bull;	The FBI will incur costs associated with shipping equipment to vendor and vendor will be responsible for costs associated with the return of equipment.<br />&bull;	All service personnel must meet FBI security requirements to access secure FBI space:<br />o	U.S. citizen to access FBI space<br />o	Submit and Pass Criminal Background Check</p>
<p>Any, and all, questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted by email to Jerry D. Varnell, jdvarnell@fbi.gov.</p>

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center (LaRC) as a means of conducting market research to identify potential sources for a follow-on procurement to the Science Office for Mission Assessments (SOMA) support contract entitled "Evaluations, Assessments, Studies, Services, and Support 2" (NNL15AA02B). The results of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement, including whether the requirement can be set aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology), with a size standard of 1,000 employees.
<div><br />The Science Office for Mission Assessments (SOMA) is located at NASA Langley Research Center and is responsible for the management and oversight of evaluations, assessments, and studies for the NASA Headquarters Science Mission Directorate (SMD). The scope of this contract will include evaluations, assessments, studies, services, and support for SOMA, other NASA organizations, and other Government agencies as designated in individual task orders. Interested offerors/vendors shall submit a capability statement depicting required capabilities in the following areas:</div>
<div><br /><strong>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</strong>: NASA is very interested in industry feedback regarding conflict of interest (COI) and limitations of future contracting. NASA anticipates inclusion of NFS Clause 1852.209-71 Limitation of Future Contracting. Comments and discussion about the COI and limitation of future contracting requirements will not be subject to the page limitation.</div>
<div><br />Interested offerors/vendors are advised that the resulting solicitation will contain stringent requirements concerning avoiding/mitigating/neutralizing Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI), avoiding/mitigating/neutralizing Personal Conflict of Interest (PCI), non-disclosure of sensitive and proprietary information, and limitations on future contracting. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:</div>
<div><br />1.	The successful Contractor will be precluded from participating in any capacity, in support of a respondent, in any solicitations where it will be providing evaluative services under this contract.</div>
<div><br />2.	The Contractor will be ineligible to perform on any work arising from, or related to, any proposal evaluation, assessment, or study on which it performed these services, except as required in performance of this contract. The Contractor may propose to SMD Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), Announcements of Opportunity (AOs), and grants that do not arise from or have not been part of the work performed under this contract.</div>
<div><br />3.	To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, sensitive, business confidential, or financial data of other companies or the Government, and as long as the data remain proprietary, sensitive, or confidential, the Contractor will be required to  protect the data from unauthorized use and disclosure. The Contractor will be required to agree not to use the data for any other purpose including, but not limited to, competing for future work. Potential offerors/vendors are advised that a firewall cannot be used to mitigate OCI. Consequently, the selected offeror/vendor will be restricted from pursuing other work outside of this contract that would cause an OCI during the performance of this contract.</div>
<div><br /><strong>EVALUATIONS</strong>: Proposal/Concept Study Report (CSR) evaluations are conducted in accordance with the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Supplement PART 1872 ACQUISITION OF FLIGHT INVESTIGATIONS. Evaluations for multiple solicitations may overlap, which will require staffing of a large number (275 or greater) of panel positions simultaneously. These panels will include a large number of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).</div>
<div><br />A typical evaluation task order requires the Contractor to staff one panel, which may comprise multiple sub-panels, with expert panel/sub-panel leads, full members, and specialist members to evaluate proposals/CSRs for space science missions/investigations, the results of which will play an integral role in selection/down-selection (KDP A/KDP B) decisions by NASA SMD. Acquisition Webpages for recent solicitations and a planning list for applicable SMD solicitations are available at https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/. Each panel member evaluates their assigned proposals/CSRs and submits individual initial evaluation comments via a NASA-provided secure web site. The panel engages in a series of web conferences and/or telecons over a specified period of time to draft strengths and weaknesses findings based on the applicable evaluation criterion or criteria defined in the solicitation. The draft findings are then posted on the NASA-provided secure web site. All panel members gather together physically to discuss evaluation findings at a plenary evaluation meeting/meetings. In the case of CSR evaluations, a site visit for each submitted CSR, comprising two full days over three days and two nights, will require participation by roughly half of the panel members. Panel members will be polled on the overall risk ratings or grades for each proposal/CSR at the plenary/final plenary meeting.</div>
<div><br /><strong>ASSESSMENTS</strong>: Assessments are typically independent reviews of missions/investigations and programs that evaluate progress at major milestones in accordance with specified procedures (e.g., NPR 7123.1B, NPR 7120.5E, NASA/SP-2016-3706/REV B, etc.). Assessments include analyzing technical, management, cost, schedule, and other aspects of SMD missions/investigations and programs, as well as other NASA missions/investigations and programs.</div>
<div><br /><strong>STUDIES</strong>: Studies are typically analyses where the conclusions or recommendations may affect assessments and proposal evaluations. Studies include analyzing management, scientific, technical, cost, schedule, and other aspects of SMD missions/investigations and programs, as well as other NASA missions/investigations and programs.</div>
<div><br /><strong>LOGISTICS, FACILITIES AND INFORMATION SUPPORT</strong>: The Contractor will be required to provide logistics, facilities, and information support necessary to perform evaluations, assessments, and studies as required by individual task orders.</div>
<div><br /><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</strong>: The Contractor will be required to maintain a Facility Clearance at the Top Secret level with no safeguarding required. The Contractor work will require access to classified information at a Government or other applicable facility to be identified on the Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification, DD Form 254.</div>
<div><br />Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities should submit a Capability Statement of no more than eight (8) pages (including attachments) with a minimum font size of 12. The Capability Statement should indicate the offeror's/vendor's ability and experience in performing the aspects of the effort described above. Please include a specific example (or examples) of the offeror's/vendor's experience and contracts with services similar to the EASSS 3 requirement. It is requested that the following be included in the eight (8)-page limit:<br /><br /></div>
<div>
<p>a)	Name and address of firm;<br />b)	Point of Contact information to include name, title, phone number, and email address;<br />c)	Whether you intend to submit an offer, and if so, would you submit as a prime or subcontractor;<br />d)	Size of business concern and date the size designation is good through (large, small, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, woman-owned small business);<br />e)	Affiliate information to include parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub), or subcontractors (if potential prime); and<br />f)	Explain your understanding of the scope of work and capability to perform, including prior experience as a prime or sub, and how this work relates to NASA's requirement.  <br />g)	List of relevant experience by identifying contract numbers, technical description/scope, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and point of contact with email, physical address and phone number, and the role your company played.<br />h)	Whether your company has the required facility clearance and whether you can provide/obtain cleared personnel.</p>
<p>Additionally, a draft Statement of Work is attached. NASA is considering forgoing a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement. Therefore, industry is encouraged to provide comments, questions, and recommendations regarding the draft Statement of Work. In addition, LaRC is interested in feedback related to suggestions for contract type and subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>The estimated final RFP release date is on or about January 2020. The estimated award date for this contract is on or about July/August 2020. NASA anticipates awarding a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with an estimated duration of five years.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for the information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resulting solicitation for the requirement. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of potential offerors/vendors to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>All responses and questions shall be submitted in writing, via email, to larc-easss3@mail.nasa.gov no later than 4:00 PM EST on 18 November 2019.</p>
<p>Please reference EASSS 3 Sources Sought in the subject line of your response.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to determine interest in participation and to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a) business development participants, HUBZone small business concerns, service disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, and economically disadvantaged women owned small business (EDWOSB) concerns and women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns) that can provide solution for the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Procurement Notices Publishing and Electronic Bid Submission Software Service requirement. The information from this market research will help MCC plan their acquisition strategy and requirements development. Firms are strongly encouraged to provide comments, questions, and suggestions relative to the project scope, methodologies and technologies, and approach. Any input that businesses or interested parties would like to provide will be reviewed and considered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The MCC requires a solution offered as a Software as a Service (SaaS) that can accessed by procurement officials in MCC countries and bidders worldwide.<br />This RFI is intended to help MCC determine:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Availability of commercial &lsquo;International Tenders' platforms for timely publishing of procurement notices and opportunities supported by key functionality such as ease of publishing by purchasers, search, tracking of opportunities, custom alerts, notifications for bidders. Support usage analytics and syndication of content to additional Federal and commercial tender publishing platforms for automated replication of content.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) Facilitate procurement of goods, works, consultant, and non-consultant services that need to be acquired to implement the projects funded by MCC. Unlike a typical "Procure-to-Pay" cycle, MCC is currently interested only in the "bid-management" component where bidders/suppliers can view the bid documents/RFx and electronically submit bids/proposals/quotes).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, MCC seeks to determine whether the solutions are available as a single SaaS application or subscribe two different platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please provide the above information no later than 12:00 PM, November 20, 2019, via submission to glimpmd@mcc.gov and gargp@mcc.gov.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is looking for sources which would be interested in performing unexpected dry-dock repairs for Coast Guard Cutter KUKUI.
<p>There are 2 performance period PROJECTIONS as of this time noted below:</p>
<p>Projection 1:<br />Solicitation issued: 1 Nov<br />Responses/quotes due: 12 Nov<br />Award: 22 - 25 Nov<br />POP: 2 Dec - 23 December</p>
<p>Projection 2:<br />Solicitation issued: 23 Oct<br />Responses/quotes due: 30 October<br />Award: 8 Nov<br />POP: 15 Nov - 6 December</p>
<p>Coast Guard Cutter KUKUUI is a 225' Seagoing Buoy Tender home ported in Sitka, AK. It is projected there will be approximately 6 work items in this requirement as noted below:</p>
<p>Work Item 1: Hull Plating Renew (roughly 10 to 30 square feet)<br />Work Item 2: Thruster seals renew (for both thrusters)<br />Work Item 3: Lube oil replace (take out old oil &amp; replace with new more environmentally friendly oil)<br />Work Item 4: Dry-dock<br />Work Item 5: Temporary Services<br />Work Item 6: Sea Trials</p>
<p>The cutter is restricted to the following area: homeport and West Coast United States</p>
<p>Companies which would be interested in submitting a proposal for this requirement should reply to this sources sought notice noting: if they are available for both projected performance periods and if not which one, their business size status such as large business, small business, HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Women Owned Small Business etc.... Further if there are no past performance evaluations on file in the Past Performance Information System Retrieval database, contractors should provide a couple past performance references including the following information: contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Replies should be sent by 22 October 2019, 10:00 am Pacific Time to: Andrew.G.Jacobs@uscg.mil &amp; Rosalie.H.Ignacio@uscg.mil.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Marine Corps Recruiting Command (MCRC) is completing its transition to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) for each of the Marine Corps Districts (MCD) Headquarters (HQs) and the Marine Corps Recruiting Station HQs in accordance with DODI 8100.04.  The use of VoIP is part of the General Services Administration (GSA) broader Network Services 2020 strategy as well as Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) End of Life on Legacy Telecom Services by FY2024.  This type of VoIP technology will allow MCRC users to make calls via the existing Ethernet platform rather than conventional legacy Plain Old Telephone Systems (POTS).  When complete, MCRC will have gained the benefits of a full VoIP Unified system that will have a substantial annual cost savings over legacy Telecom services and allow MCRC Users to share content, instant message, Video Conference, Whiteboard sessions and more, with other MCRC users in its network.   The purpose of this Sources Sought is to provide industry an opportunity to inform the Government of any potential alternative or "equal" equipment that would enable MCRC to fully complete its implementation of VoIP command wide without brand name requirements, taking into account certain constraints described below.
<p>MCRC began transitioning to a VoIP network in 2016 with an initial purchase (approximately $950k) of VoIP equipment.  Since that initial purchase in 2016, MCRC and the Districts continued making individual purchases of additional VoIP equipment to continue implementation of the existing VoIP network (see attached equipment list for a summary of the VoIP equipment purchased to date).  As a result of these prior purchases and prior implementation, MCRC already has a Microsoft Skype Unified Communication (UC) network in place and operational.  MCRC now seeks to fully complete its implementation of VoIP Command Wide by establishing an indefinite-delivery contract vehicle that allows a streamlined method for the Districts to purchase VoIP equipment as funds are available (purchases under the contract will be for equipment only and not for managed services related to VoIP).  A single-award Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is anticipated with a four (4) year ordering period.  Minimum and maximum amounts will be specified in the solicitation and resultant award.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates it will be necessary to continue purchasing the specific brand name VoIP equipment on the attached equipment list under this potential IDIQ in order to ensure network uniformity and compatibility with MCRC's existing VoIP equipment and unified network, as well as to ensure compliance with DoD/USMC approved hardware/software lists and allow for seamless growth in MCRC's existing VoIP UC network.  In order to consider potential alternative or "equal" equipment, the below constraints must be taken into account and satisfied:</p>
<p>1.	Any alternative or "equal" equipment must maintain uniformity and compatibility with MCRC's existing VoIP equipment and UC network (see attached equipment list).  In other words, the alternative or "equal" equipment cannot require re-engineering of the existing VoIP UC network (such as bringing in new hardware and network configurations).  The existing VoIP UC network was engineered, configured, and tested based on the VoIP equipment previously purchased by MCRC and the Districts (see attached equipment list); and</p>
<p>2.	Any alternative or "equal" equipment must be tested and accepted for use on DOD networks by DISA and released on the DISA Approved Product List (APL) for VoIP. You must be able to provide the Joint Interoperability Test Commands Letter of Certification.  If the equipment is currently undergoing testing by DISA but has not yet been approved/released on the APL, your response must provide an expected timeframe for approval/release onto the APL.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should respond with a capabilities statement which addresses the following information:</p>
<p>1.	General Business Information-business name, address, DUNS/CAGE, etc.</p>
<p>2.	Business Size/Socioeconomic Status (Large, Small, 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone)</p>
<p>3.	Narrative Information describing the potential alternative or "equal" equipment. In addition to providing said equipment's APL Joint Interoperability Test Commands Letter of Certification, the information must be detailed enough to enable the Government to assess whether the alternative or "equal" equipment can realistically satisfy the Government's requirement.  For example, the narrative information must affirmatively demonstrate how any alternative or "equal" equipment satisfies both constraints described above. Mere assertions or statements that the "equal" equipment will satisfy both constraints will not be considered adequate; you must provide supporting information for any such assertion or statement.</p>
<p>Information is for planning purposes only and no solicitation document exists at this time.  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure the VoIP equipment or to issue a solicitation.  In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.</p>
<p>Any questions on this Sources Sought shall be emailed to david.lione@usmc.mil no later than 5:00 pm ET on Tuesday, 22 October 2019 with a subject line that reads "MCRC VoIP Equipment Sources Sought Questions."  The Government will respond to timely questions received via a Sources Sought amendment prior to the due date and time for receipt of capability statements.</p>
<p>All capability statements shall be emailed to david.lione@usmc.mil with a subject line that reads "MCRC VoIP Equipment Sources Sought Response" no later than 12:00 pm ET on Tuesday, 29 October 2019.  Incomplete responses which fail to address all areas identified above will not be considered as part of the market research.</p>

Sources Sought Notice
Employee Engagement System and Services
August 7, 2019
New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System   
Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center
Introduction:
The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) require an Employee Engagement System with a web-based survey and associated reports, briefings, and tools for ten facilities through-out the United States.
Background:
The VA Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) is the division of the Veteran Health Administration s Office of Research and Development that is responsible for the planning and conduct of large multicenter clinical trials and epidemiological studies within the Department of Veterans Affairs. To achieve this mission, the CSP has a clinical research infrastructure that operates under the management of a Central Office in Washington, D.C. The CSP is comprised of professional experts at five data and statistical coordinating centers (CSPCCs), a clinical research pharmacy coordinating center (CRPCC), and four epidemiological resource centers (ECs). Additionally, the CSP partners with the VA Health Economics Resource Center to perform economic analyses on its clinical trials.

The Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CRPCC, located in Albuquerque, NM) began its engagement journey in 2007 with a goal to survey employee engagement, using the feedback reports to increase engagement scores, benchmark against other organizations, increase customer satisfaction, and decrease employee turnover. In 2010, the journey was extended to include the five CSPCCs (located in Boston, MA; Hines, IL; West Haven, CT; Perry Point, MD; and Palo Alto, CA) in conjunction with the Program s strategic plan to deploy ISO 9001:2008 with the mutual goal to increase efficiency, productivity and to establish a validated quality management system. 

The CSP has been collecting benchmarked employee engagement survey data since 2014. CSP now has a need for an integrated employee engagement system that allows the program to conduct engagement-supporting activities such as peer recognition, tracking of engagement-related goals, and ad-hoc surveys in addition to an annual survey.

Request for Information 
TAC-21-56639
Enterprise Cloud Fax (ECFax) Service

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only issued for conducting market research and eliciting industry s input as to the Government s requirement.  Accordingly, this RFI constitutes neither a Request for Quote (RFQ) nor a guarantee that one will be issued by the Government in the future; furthermore, it does not commit the Government to contract for any services described herein.  Do not submit a Quote/Proposal. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals or quotes, and therefore, will not accept, review, or evaluate unsolicited proposals or quotes received in response hereto. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract/order, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted because of this request.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the submission of the information being requested or, reimburse expenses incurred for responses to this RFI.  The information provided may be used by VA in developing its acquisition strategy and Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFQ, if issued. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary; however, any information received shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the respondent.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted, or competition sensitive information contained in their response. This is a request for information and does not obligate the Government in any way, nor does it commit the Government to any specific course of action.

Be advised that set-aside decisions may be made based on the information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses should be as complete and informative as possible.

Background:
VA is in a process of migrating from the slow and costly manual/semi-automated faxing processes to multiple vendor electronic faxing solutions.  Across VA, multiple stove-pipe solutions exist, and additional requirements are being contracted locally, resulting in inefficient implementation and sustainment costs.  In addition, with the federal Governments drive towards  cloud first  and  cloud smart  strategies this represents a critical opportunity to improve and simplify a vital VA communications requirement while simultaneously reducing the physical footprint and capital expenditures cost to VA.

At this time, there are multiple faxing vendor services locally configured and implemented across VA.  A centralized managed cloud hosted faxing service will allow for increased efficiency and security, thus decreasing the time and cost associated with VA staff manually processing documents and support new operational requirements.

Scope of Work:
VA requires a full-service provider to implement and manage a Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) cloud-based, scalable, secure digital fax/data transfer service, with the application to be fully hosted in a vendor/partner Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) certified facility.  For the purposes of this RFI a  fax  is a single transmission or reception with a session that may consist of multiple pages with a cover sheet.

The managed Enterprise Cloud Fax (ECFax) service shall provide VA the ability to send and receive secure fax documents electronically, exponentially improving the security and efficiency of faxing services within VA.  VA sites requiring a managed ECFax service shall be able to connect to the cloud-based system, streamlining the request process, and reducing the implementation time. Sites with existing faxing services will migrate to the managed ECFax service with support from the ECFax provider.  Outside parties (Veteran or other stakeholders) shall have the ability to send faxes in secure manner which the managed ECFax service will capture and route to the correct VA office, process, or staff member.  Similarly, VA shall have the ability to send outbound faxes without the need to print, timestamp, and scan prior to sending a document.  This shall include the capture and transmission of data from various VA health applications such as Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA), Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and future Electronic Health Record system provided by Cerner Corporation via the use of Application Programming Interface (API).

The Contractor shall provide the managed infrastructure services on a 24 hour per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year basis.  

VA s faxing solution(s) currently operate on multiple different platforms with a wide array of capabilities with various levels of business process integration.  The scope of this effort shall provide a managed cloud hosted faxing service that meets the collective needs of all VA Administrations, Offices, and locations. 

VA s goal is to transition all of its faxing solutions to the managed ECFax service within five years after award of the base contract.  The current faxing services environment is highly diversified, from small, medium, and large geographically redundant enterprise-level faxing solution supporting all VA administrations and business offices.  Transition of existing faxing services shall be in a phased approach, beginning with a small facility/organization up to and including whole administrations dependent on vendor capability.  As new faxing requirements are requested, the Contractor shall implement these new requirements through the managed ECFax service simultaneous with ongoing migration activities.

v. Irradiated Components   approximately 20 units
III. VAMC Atlanta Blood Bank Department must adhere to all the blood supplier s return and transfer policies when returning blood and blood components to the vendor or transferring products to other area hospitals.

IV. It is the responsibility of the contractor s personnel to park in the
appropriate designated parking areas.  Parking information and building entry shall be coordinated with each facility COR.
V. The Atlanta VAMC does not validate parking nor is the facility responsible for parking violations.

PRODUCT FEATURES:

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Cyber Development Directorate, Perimeter Defense Division, Internet Protection Branch (ID51), is conducting this Request for Information (RFI) as market research to determine sources with competencies to promote information assurance by supporting the Filter List Management (FLM) Program.  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), at the request of the Joint Task Force - Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) a component of United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and in support of National Security goals, deployed a Filter List Management System, in 2003.  This Filter List Management system provides control of existing Department of Defense (DoD) routers capable of filtering packets based on Layer 3 and Layer 4 information of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.
<p>The Filter List Management System currently provides configuration control, management capability and supports the rapid deployment of access control lists (ACL) with 120,000+ entries to the Internet Screening Routers (ISR) at the NIPRNet-to-Internet Gateways.  The system supports the implementation of DoD Instruction 8551.1, "Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM)", August 13, 2004; DOD INFOCON policy, DoD Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) Whitelist requirements enhancing the network security capabilities at the NIPRNet-to-Internet Gateways. The ability to support large ACL filters enables the use of tightly coupled exceptions that allow traffic between specific authorized subnets (user network) to a destination subnet (user network) within the DoD networks.  The most prominent capabilities of the current FLM system are the abilities to translate ACL filters from one syntax format to multiple other syntax formats,  provide logic and syntax error checking, and support for rapid deployment of ACL filters to the ISRs, thus enabling the JTF-GNO to respond to the dynamic network security that threaten the DoD.  DISA is pursuing the technical refresh to ensure continued mission support through the capabilities of the FLM System.</p>
<p><br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for the technical refresh of the FLM System. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated experience with support for Filter List Management.  All interested contractors are requested to provide written response to the questions below.  A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services.  In addition, this information will be used to assist DISA in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan and/or small business goal percentages.</p>

<SUBJECT>Partnership Opportunity with USGS Next Generation Water Observing System
<SOLNBR>10_17_2019_OPA
<RESPDATE>123119
<CONTACT>Brian Pellerin, Chief, Hydrologic Networks Branch, Phone 703-648-6865, Email gs-w_ngwos_rfi@usgs.gov - Esther Eng, Technology Transfer Officer, Phone (703) 648-7550, Email gs-a_opa@usgs.gov
<DESC><strong>Opportunity: </strong>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is seeking information from industry, academia, nonprofits, and research institutions on innovative technologies that should be considered as part of the Next Generation Water Observing System (NGWOS) effort ongoing within the USGS.  This includes technologies that strategically enhance the temporal and spatial collection of water quantity, quality, and water-use data in surface and groundwater across the United States.   The data will be served through a modernized USGS National Water Information System that will be coupled to advanced modeling tools to inform daily water operations, decision-making during water emergencies, assessments of past trends in water quantity and quality, and forecasts of future water availability.
<div><br /></div>
<div>NGWOS aims to foster innovation and development of monitoring technologies and methodologies to make data more affordable and more rapidly available. Monitoring innovations also are expected to lead to more types of data at higher temporal and spatial frequencies. The application and benefits of these innovations will extend beyond the NGWOS watersheds and be incorporated into routine operation of USGS monitoring networks.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This Request for Information (RFI) is to help identify promising technologies or interested partners who are capable of jointly developing technologies that can integrate with current USGS research and development per the Stevenson&shy;Wydler Act (15 U.S.C. &sect; 3710a, as amended). Responses to this RFI should briefly describe the proposed technology, including the type of data collected, potential applications for the data, and the technology readiness / product maturity level.  Technologies of interest include but are not limited to:
<p>- Non-contact sensing for velocity, stage, and water temperature,</p>
<p>- Long range, low power observation network technologies,</p>
<p>- Instrumentation for monitoring hydrologic budgets (ET, soil moisture, snowpack and water-use),</p>
<p>- New sensors for monitoring continuous water-quality, including sediment, nutrients, contaminants, and environmental DNA,</p>
<p>- Mobile autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and drifters for water quality and flow monitoring,</p>
<p>- Webcams and drone-mounted sensors for operational and science applications,</p>
<p>- Innovative technologies for detecting and monitoring hazards such as spills and harmful algal blooms (HABs).</p>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. If proprietary information is submitted, clearly mark this information as Confidential. The USGS will protect this information from disclosure if it meets the Federal FOIA exemptions.</p>
<p>The USGS Office of Technology Transfer will host a webinar to provide additional information about NGWOS and technology transfer opportunities on Thursday, November 14th, 2019 from 2:00 to 3:30 ET. Please visit this link to register for the webinar.</p>
<p>This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract nor will the Government pay for the requested information.  This is solely a request for information and is not a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). USGS is not accepting requests for funding applications to this RFI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The RFI is posted as 10_17_2019_OPA.  To review the RFI, please click.  Responses must be submitted by Dec 31, 2019 at the following e-mail address: gs-w_ngwos_rfi@usgs.gov.

Submit signed and dated quotes to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotes may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.

(1) Quoters are responsible for submitting quotes, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that quotes or revisions are due.<br />(2) (i) Any quote, modification, revision, or withdrawal of a quote received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of quotes is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late quote would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-<br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of quotes; or<br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of quotes and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of quotes; or<br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.<br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful quote, that makes its terms more favorable to the<br />Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.<br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the quote wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that quotes cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of quotes by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of quotes will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.<br />(5) Quotes may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of quotes.<br />Oral quotes in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

<p>Addendum 52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>The provision is changed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical <br />2. Past Performance<br />3. Price</p>
<p>Technical Capability and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than Price.  <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) This RFQ is conducted under the guidelines of FAR Parts 12 and 13. Award will be based on a determination of best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. "Best Value" means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  Best value evaluation is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the proposed solution that provides the optimal results to the Government.</p>
<p>(d) This method does not use any aspects of FAR subpart 15.3.  The use of FAR Part 12 and 13 procedures does not obligate the Government to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions with any contractors, solicit quotes or revisions thereto, or use any other source selection techniques associated with FAR subpart 15.3.</p>
<p>(e) Technical quotes will be reviewed</p>
<p>(1) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all of the contract requirements regarding the meeting space and break-out room, audio visual equipment and setup, sleeping room accommodations, food and beverage service, transportation service, and project management Quotations will be evaluated on the layout design, quality, and cleanliness of the facilities as reflected by the physical layout, d&eacute;cor, and atmosphere of meeting space including amenities to support the conference, such as free Wi-Fi in the conference space, upkeep of the facilities;</p>
<p>(2) Availability of Dates- Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Consideration will be given to quoters who can provide the required services on the preferred dates in order of preference (i.e., 1st choice dates; 2nd choice dates; and 3rd choice dates);</p>
<p>(3) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoters to provide a facility located within seven (7) miles (south of the Potomac River) of the Mark Center with adequate on-site parking for participants and presenters.</p>
<p>(f) Past performance: The Government will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on meeting room design/layout and quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference. A quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(g) Award will be made to the quote that provides the best value.</p>
<p>(h) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<CONTACT>Mr. Dennis Burns, MMESO South Data Analyst Contractor, Phone 210-536-6074, Email daniel.d.burns8.ctr@mail.mil - Mr. David V. Sheaffer, MMESO South Team Leader Contractor, Phone 210-536-6075, Email david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Reinforced Heat Reflective Shell - Hypothermia Prevention. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1905-24_Reinforced_Heat_Reflective_Shell-Hypothermia_Prevention are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Reinforced Heat Reflective Shell - Hypothermia Prevention products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil/">https://www.medical.dla.mil/</a>. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1905-24_Reinforced_Heat_Reflective_Shell-Hypothermia_Prevention. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 03 December 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MS-1905-24_Reinforced_Heat_Reflective_Shell-Hypothermia_Prevention, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Reinforced Heat Reflective Shell - Hypothermia Prevention.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Reinforced Heat Reflective Shell - Hypothermia Prevention. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $1,461,422 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MS-1905-24_Reinforced_Heat_Reflective_Shell-Hypothermia_Prevention who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1. REINFORCED HEAT REFLECTIVE SHELL - HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION ACTIVE HEAT SOURCE / 16,245 /<br />2. REINFORCED HEAT REFLECTIVE SHELL - HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION PASSIVE HEAT SOURCE / 1,540 /<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information</span><br />3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Non-Reinforced Heat Reflective Shell - Hypothermia Prevention. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1905-25_Non-Reinforced_Heat_Reflective_Shell-Hypothermia_Prevention are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Non-Reinforced Heat Reflective Shell - Hypothermia Prevention products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1905-25_Non-Reinforced_Heat_Reflective_Shell-Hypothermia_Prevention. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 03 December 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MS-1905-25_Non-Reinforced_Heat_Reflective_Shell-Hypothermia_Prevention, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Non-Reinforced Heat Reflective Shell - Hypothermia Prevention.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Non-Reinforced Heat Reflective Shell - Hypothermia Prevention. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $3,022,984 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MS-1905-25_Non-Reinforced_Heat_Reflective_Shell-Hypothermia_Prevention who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br /></span>The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1. NON-REINFORCED HEAT REFLECTIVE SHELL - HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION ACTIVE HEAT SOURCE / 19,215 /<br />2. NON-REINFORCED HEAT REFLECTIVE SHELL - HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION PASSIVE HEAT SOURCE / 37,999 /<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information<br /></span>3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO South Data Analyst Contractor, Mr. Dennis Burns, 210-536-6074, daniel.d.burns8.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO South Team Leader Contractor, Mr. David Sheaffer, 210-536-6075, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The government has Interagency and cooperative agreements with Federal and State agencies and private landholders. Aircraft may be dispatched for interagency use. A BOA is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between the Government and a Contractor, to define terms and prices that may be applied to a future contract between the parties. Notwithstanding the use of the term "contract" throughout this Solicitation, a basic ordering agreement is not itself a contract. Orders issued on awarded BOAs will become binding contracts if and when the Contractor accepts the order.

SCOPE OF WORK: OVER-THE-DOOR ALARMS FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION
SUMMARY OF REQUESTED PRODUCT:  Contractor to provide over-the-door monitoring and alarm system for doors in fourteen (14) patient rooms in 6th floor, A-wing, Inpatient Mental Health unit in Building 500 Main Hospital at Martinsburg Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 510 Butler Ave, Martinsburg WV.  
Door alarm system is to utilize photoelectric beam detection to detect presence of potential ligature activity before pressure is applied to the door.  This detection allows for more rapid response time in suicide prevention and emergency assistance.
Procurement is needed for all components of the door alarm system, which includes the following:
(28) Photoelectric beam sensors (two sensors per door)
(13) Electrified Center Pivot Hinges
(1) Electrified Full Mortise Continuous Hinge
(14) Keyed deactivation switches
(14) Emergency Notification Strobes
(4) Multi-door hubs
(1) Master Control Unit with remote touch screen interface panel
(1) Auxiliary Power Supply
(1) Hallway siren
(1) Installation of Hardware (See Statement Below)
Currently, the VA intends to install this system with its own employees. However due to time constraints for training our own personnel, we are requesting the vendor to also give us a price on installing the hardware in case we do not have the time allotted to send individuals to train. This line item will not be evaluated as part of the overall price during the review process, but if the VA decides to use the installation of the line items the solicitation will not be recompeted. All contractors whose quotes are determined technically acceptable, will be given notice the government intends to evaluate and award with the installation line item. These contractors will be allowed one more  Best and Final  before awarding based on lowest price.

After installation, system is to be certified and commissioned by manufacturer-certified inspector.  If the Contractor is not responsible for installation of system, this procurement is to include manufacturer-certified staff trainer to train Martinsburg VAMC staff in system installation.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS OF DETECTION SYSTEM:  The requested over-the-top door alarm system will use photoelectric beams to detect the presence of a ligature (such as a bed sheet, towel, etc.) before pressure is applied, by alerting when there is a foreign object interruption the thru-beam between the transmitter and receiver.  Photoelectric beams are to be protected by ligature-resistant casings.

The system shall be addressable, self-monitoring, and capable of remote diagnostics. The monitoring panel shall have an LCD display that will show the time and location of the event. Upon detection, a visual indicator shall be activated at the location of the event, as well as at a remote monitoring panel, typically located in the nurse s station. In addition, an audible alarm shall also be activated in a predetermined hallway location, as well as at the remote monitoring panel in the Nurse s Station. Once initiated, the alarm will remain active even if the ligature is removed. The alarm shall be manually reset using the keyed switch located near the door jamb. After being reset, the audible and visual indicators will be cleared. The system shall record and display recent events in an electronic log, available for immediate review.

All event messages are to be stored for a period of 1 year and be available for download. This system is to have the capability of recording events, including the date and time of each event, and shall be accessible for review as required.

Solicitation N00024-19-R-2412 was released in October 2018 for this same effort and in April 2019 eight (8) MAC/IDIQs were awarded to compete for tasks in this area. These MACs had a cumulative ceiling value of $85M. However, based on an increased projection of potential effort in this area the Government is planning on making a substantial increase to the cumulative ceiling of these MACs and is conducting this rolling admission to give additional offerors a chance to obtain a MAC/IDIQ to compete for this workload.</p>
<p>Examples of areas the Government may include in a final solicitation under this requirement include: <br /><br />1. System level cost analysis with TOC modeling; <br /><br />2. Development of a should cost analysis which evaluates the economy and efficiency of a contractor's existing work force, methods (to include industrial design, manufacturing and estimating), materials, equipment, real property, operating systems, and management; <br /><br />3. Development of TOC analysis to assess acquisition lifecycle cost;<br /><br />4. A practical knowledge of the nature and operations of the industry or industries; and the materials, facilities and methods employed by the industry or industries in constructing or repairing large Navy vessels, major weapons systems, Navy aircraft, or similar items; and<br /><br />5. System level Supply Chain Risk Management.</p>
<p>If a solicitation is eventually released, a non-exhaustive list of defense prime contractors and subcontractors that could raise a potential conflict of interest will be included. Any interested contractor who is doing work for DoD contractors involved with Navy shipbuilding, weapon systems, or aircraft procurements related to the requirements or substantially similar work for listed contractors will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>Contractors will also be asked for its planned list of work for DoD contractors similar to the list of planned work covered in the solicitation that covers a period of two years from the date of any solicitation release. All planned work will be evaluated and a determination will be made by NAVSEA as to whether a contractor will or will not be eligible for award on the basis of planned work.</p>
<p>As a result of the solicitation, NAVSEA intends to award additional Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts no later than January 2020. These contracts along with the original eight (8) contracts will have an ordering period through 18 April 2024. The IDIQ awardees will then compete for individual delivery orders under the IDIQ.</p>
<p><strong>The previous solicitation (N00024-19-R-2412) has been attached</strong> to help offerors prepare for the release of this new solicitation.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>

<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Is each reusable container contained in individual cabinets that lock? 3 Gallon containers will need be in a wall mounted lockable frame (provided by vendor). All other sizes require a wheeled cart (provided by vendor).
Are they already installed? Contractor to provide
If yes, will the containers that hold the existing SHARPS stay?
If not, will the subcontractor need to provide the cabinets for the reusable SHARPS containers? Contractor to provide
Who is determining the replacement pull? Contractor determines in accordance with PWS (container should not be more than  full).
Does the subcontractor need to provide a tech to service the SHARPS containers or is that service done at the site level?  Contractor to do all labor involved with containers.  VA personnel only involved outside normal work hours AND because of an unusual event, such as, MICU patient having issues.
Will the subcontractor need to provide storage cart? Contractor provided
If a tech is needed to service the SHARPS containers, how often are they at each site (frequency)? Determined by contractor but must be in accordance with PWS.
Will the Government afford vendors an opportunity in advance to conduct site surveys at each facility or at least the main facilities in Gainesville and Lake City where the majority of the containers are to determine container types and sizes? There is not a site visit set up for this requirement.
If not, will the Government provide the container sizes and counts of each size container for each facility? This is critical information related to product orders, installations and equipment needs. Without this information vendors will not know which sizes of containers to order and how many of each size and type. See number 2 above.
Will vendors be required to provide onsite service technicians to exchange sharps containers from room to room and floor to floor for all facilities included or just the main facilities in Gainesville and Lake City? OR will the sharps container be exchanged by designated VA personnel and picked up by the vendor from designated accumulation areas at each facility? See number 4a above.
Will the onsite service technicians be required to work 40 hours weekly exchanging sharps containers as the bid calls for transportation services 5 days per week Monday through Friday? See number 5 above
Will the Government consider both Vertical Drop containers as well as Horizontal Drop containers? Government does not specify vertical or horizontal containers so both can be considered for evaluation.
Will the Government consider alternate container sizes that may not be exactly (either slightly smaller or larger in capacity) that the sizes listed in the bid? Vendor is required to provide sizes listed in their quote.

ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED!

<DESC><p>***Note this amendment updates the submission mailbox instruction in Page 7, Part III Modular Open Systems Approaches (MOSA) are a warfighting imperative. Victory in future conflicts will in part be determined by our ability to rapidly adapt systems, integrate new capabilities, and share information from machine to machine. Modular open systems utilize open interfaces to connect well defined modules. The CCDC C5ISR Center has made substantial investments in developing MOSA for C5ISR applications. These efforts have focused on the following:<br />1.) Software frameworks that support modular reusable software<br />2.) RF system interfaces enabling third party access/control of sophisticated RF chains<br />3.) Embedded computing hardware interfaces<br />4.) Network interfaces for discovery, management, and data dissemination<br />The results of these MOSA initiatives have resulted in the development of C4ISR/EW Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS) which is aligned with the Sensor Open Systems Architecture (SOSA) Technical Standard. CMOSS leverages open standards such as the Modular Open RF Architecture (MORA), Vehicular Integration for C4ISR/EW Interoperability (VICTORY), OpenVPX, REDHAWK, Software Communications Architecture (SCA), and Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE). Specifications in active development and use can be found at the following locations:<br />VICTORY (https://www.victory-standards.org/index.php/publicly-available-documents)<br />MORA (https://www.victory-standards.org/index.php/publicly-available-documents)<br />OpenVPX(http://www.vita.com)<br />REDHAWK (https://redhawksdr.github.io/Documentation)<br />SCA (http://www.public.navy.mil/jtnc)<br />FACE (http://www.opengroup.org/face)<br />SOSA (http://www.opengroup.org/sosa)<br />The proposed technical approach for all topics should be designed in accordance with CMOSS and SOSA whenever possible.</p>

<DESC><p>Introduction <br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The development of a safe and efficacious preventive HIV-1 vaccine is one of the highest priorities of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). NIAID supports a portfolio of preclinical, translational, and clinical research to advance HIV vaccine efforts. The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) supports research programs to discover novel vaccine strategies, assess correlates of immunogenicity and of protections elicited by experimental vaccines and provides an infrastructure for the manufacturing and testing of novel products. To achieve this goal, the Government anticipates awarding Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to multiple Contractors that meet the overall qualifications for individual Task Areas.</p>
<p>There are two current single-award IDIQ contracts that provide preclinical services for HIV Vaccine efforts ranging from initial product discovery through full current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) manufacturing and readiness for clinical trials and/or product licensure. <br />Contract No. HHSN272201700010I, with Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc. (ABL), entitled "NIAID Preclinical Development Support" was awarded in June 2017 as a single award IDIQ type contract for a period of seven years (6/10/2017 through 6/9/2024) and a maximum quantity of $318,500,000.00.</p>
<p>Contract No. HHSN272201600011I, with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), entitled "NIAID Process and Analytical Support for Development of HIV Vaccines" was awarded in July 2016 as a single-award IDIQ type contract for a period of seven years (7/15/2016 through 7/14/2023) and a maximum quantity of $98,587,183.00</p>
<p>The current Contractors have provided preclinical services including: manufacturing feasibility assessments, analytical characterization and method development, audits, regulatory documentation, process development and current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) manufacturing, and safety and immunogenicity studies.
