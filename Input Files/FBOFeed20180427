<DESC>THIS IS A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&amp;D) NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
<p>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) plans to compete and award a contract for a Chemical Screening and Optimization Facility. This will be a full and open competition resulting in an Indefinite/Delivery, Indefinite/Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract. The RFP will be issued VIA FEDBIZOPPS on or about May 11, 2018.</p>
<p>The Contraception Research Branch (CRB) of NICHD has identified three gaps within their three main areas of study: 1) Although contraceptive use is commonplace throughout the world, its effects on human health are not well understood. 2) There is a need to develop new contraceptive methods for populations that don't have adequate choices. Current methods also need to be improved upon. 3) Development of new and improved methods of contraception will require research focused on addressing other knowledge gaps such as identification and validation of novel contraceptive drug targets, global identification and reproductive tract specific genes and proteins, development of improved devices and delivery systems. The CRB hopes to bridge some of these knowledge gaps with the development and improvement of contraception methods through the award of this contract.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this acquisition will be to provide a state-of-the-art facility with the capabilities and capacity to carry out chemical screening and optimization with the goal of identifying potent and safe contraceptive agents. The required research at the Chemical Screening and Optimization Facility (CSOF) will encompass discovery and optimization of small molecule antagonists and/or agonists of validated targets using state-of-the art scientific disciplines to support that goal.</p>
<p>The execution of these varied tasks requires scientific expertise and capability in the areas of medicinal chemistry, assay development, high throughput screening, x-ray crystallography, molecular modeling, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance and pharmacology. This joint effort between the CSOF and NIH staff requires effective communication taking place on a regular basis among all participants. It requires maintenance of secure, up-to-date records of all activities and the ability to share documents as required. Compound inventory needs to be maintained and compound deliveries tracked.</p>
<p>This RFP (NIH-NICHD-CRB-2018-13) will be available electronically on or about May 11, 2018 on FedBizOpps (FBO) website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) intends to procure the services of Eaton Electrical, on a sole source basis, for the upgrade of the Foreseer software from V5.2 to V6.3 and annual maintenance for the existing CFTC environmental monitoring system that detects power, heat, and humidity issues for critical infrastructure systems and labs in each of the four CFTC locations (Headquarters and three Regional Offices). The annual maintenance services will include a base period of performance of one (1) year, and four (4) option years. Based on the procurement history of this requirement, CFTC believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government for procuring and deploying a new system by a new contractor. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers and, as such, no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the date and time identified above. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC.<br />

<DESC>FOR INFORMATION ONLY:<br />This Pre-Solicitation Notice is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming. All questions regarding this Pre-Solicitation notice should be submitted in writing via email to Vincent Daniels.
<p>Construction Project:<br />U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, requires restoration of a barrier dune on Empire Spit located in Tokeland, Washington in Willapa Bay.  The dune will be restored by the hydraulic dredging of approximately 600,000 cubic yards from an established in-water borrow site (approximately 1.5 miles from the borrow site to the dune location) and placement by hydraulic pipeline. The work needs to be performed over a period of one construction season estimated between June 2018 and February of 2019. The purpose of the work is to restore the entire length of an approximately 12,500 ft. long existing dune to its authorized height of 25 ft. MLLW. The dune has been severely eroded in certain areas due to recent wave and storm activity. The dune will require shaping to meet dune cross section profile requirements. The use of a hydraulic cutterhead suction or hopper dredge is acceptable. There is not land based access to the site, therefore all heavy equipment used to shape the dune must be mobilized and demobilized to/from the site via water.</p>
<p>The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.</p>
<p>Solicitation number W912DW18B0009 will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov, on or about 7 March 2018. The solicitation will be an Invitation for Bids (IFB). Bids will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date. See the solicitation for details about bid opening. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, and the associated small business size standard is $36.5 million in average annual receipts. The solicitation is unrestricted and open to both large and small business concerns.</p>
<p>The solicitation documents for this requirement will be issued in electronic format only and will be made available online via the FBO website at www.fbo.gov under the subject solicitation number. NO CD's OR HARD COPIES WILL BE AVAILABLE. Offerors are responsible for checking for any update(s) to the Notice/Solicitation. The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for a bidder's inability to access the document(s) posted at the referenced website. To obtain automatic notifications of updates to this notice, log in to www.fbo.gov and add the solicitation to your Watchlist. If you would like to list your firm so others can see you are an interested vendor, click the Add Me To Interested Vendors button in the listing for this solicitation on www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>The FBO Response Date listed elsewhere in this pre-solicitation notice is for FBO archive purposes only. It may have no relationship to the actual solicitation due date. The solicitation due date and time will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that are issued.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE:<br />All contractors proposing on Department of Defense (DoD) solicitations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a contract. The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information and capabilities to the Government. The SAM website can be accessed at www.sam.gov.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.
<p>The 421St Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. Qualification requirements exist and can be located in FedBizzOps. A Source Approval Request (SAR) package must be submitted for approval determination to the Oklahoma City Small Business Office. Consequently, potential sources for this effort are companies who have a licensing agreement with the Data Rights Holder or Original Equipment Manufacturer. The company must have manufactured the Subject or Similar item within the past 36 months for the Original Equipment Manufacturer or Department of Defense and intends to produce Subject item to the Subject technical data.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND/ DESCRIPTION: The Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is conducting market research on behalf of the US Army's Office of the PM GS, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities required to perform a technology insertion effort on the LRAS3. Technology insertion would be accomplished via an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to integrate the Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) B-Kit into the current LRAS3 and mitigate obsolescence.</p>
<p>The LRAS3 is a multi-sensor system that includes a FLIR sensor, a Day Video Camera (DVC), an Eyesafe Laser Rangefinder (ELRF), and a Far Target Location (FTL) capability. The LRAS3 is a long range reconnaissance and surveillance system that provides a real-time target detection, recognition, and identification capability to the cavalry scout while operating 24-hours a day in adverse weather conditions.<br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This is a market survey to identify all parties interested in taking part in this entire effort as a prime contractor, and from sources that can act as a single system integrator in the following areas.

The authority for restriction will be FAR 6.302-1, as applied under (c) - Application for Brand Name Description. The authority will be used because several spares have features of a product, peculiar to the OEM that the Government requires. Although certain spares are restricted to the OEM as described herein, the overall requirement is anticipated to be competitive as a third party can compete by purchasing the required OEM spares from the OEM, and manufacturing the other spares that are not required to be purchased by the OEM. OEM's for certain spares are listed in attachment 0002. The capability statement should indicate the contractor's ability to procure spares from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), and to construct the other spare requirements against build to print drawings. The statement should detail production/manufacturing capacity of spares, and those of the OEM. Potential sources shall be capable of furnishing all labor, materials, facilities and equipment required to accomplish the manufacture/purchase of the spares. Generally, this entails the procurement/manufacture of component parts, inspection, testing, preservation/packaging, and shipping. Also, the capability statement should demonstrate the contractor's strategy for each part, and experience in fabricating and delivering items all spares (see attachment 0001). Some drawings have associated distribution C and D markings. The Government will furnish these drawings only after a fully executed DD2345 (attachment 0003), Non-Disclosure Agreement (attachment 0004), and Technical Data Questionnaire 1350 (attachment 5) is sent to the contracting officer, and deemed appropriately accomplished.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the capability statement should also include the following: company name, address, telephone number, email address, technical point of contract, DUNS number, Cage Code and company size (please specify as either a Large Business, Foreign-Owned Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business), and technical description of the ability to meet the requirement. Based on the responses to this sources sought Notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses. <br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government, as this is not a solicitation. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be published. If a RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Information provided will not be returned. TELEPHONE INQUIRIES/SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept questions via email ONLY. The Government is not seeking, and will not accept, unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government is not responsible and will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice.</p>
<p>All submissions are requested to be made within seven (7) calendar days from the date of this publication, via electronic mail to Point of Contact (POC) for this action: Miluska (Mila) Lewis, Contract Specialist, email: miluska.p.lewis.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<p>4. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>5. Specify any conflicts and/or concerns with the procurement of both DFA and FFS under one contract vehicle.</p>
<p>6. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition. Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice.

<DESC><p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to award multiple Firm-Fixed Price contracts under the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) HM0476-16-BAA-0001 Boosting Innovative GEOINT (BIG) efforts. This will be a two-step BAA. Step One is to submit a White Paper by the respective topic's due date/time. White Papers that are determined to be technically acceptable as evaluated against criteria published in this BAA will receive a Request for Proposal from an NGA Contracting Officer, which is Step Two. NGA welcomes all innovative and actionable White Papers that will enhance and accelerate BIG analysis. All awards will be based on merit competition. NGA's goal is to make awards under various research topic areas. The NAICS code for this procurement includes 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, but other NAICS codes may apply as well. NGA encourages small businesses and universities to participate under this BAA. NGA also strongly encourages and accepts White Papers from collaboration of entities (industry and industry, industry and university, university and university, etc.) because research in multidisciplinary Topic Areas may require forming teams with strengths in multiple science and engineering fields.<br /><br /><strong>This BIG BAA amendment solicits ideas for: Topic Area 8 - Detecting Travel Activity on All Scales</strong><br /></p>

<DESC>Fleet Logistics Center San Diego (FLCSD) is conducting a market survey to determine the interest and availability of 8(a) qualified vendors to provide galley services for Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD). The anticipated award will be a firm fixed price contract with one base year plus four (4) option years. 

The Governments intention is to compete this requirement as an 8(a) set-aside. The purpose of this notice is to canvas the marketplace to determine if there is a sufficient number of capable 8(a) contractors who intend to compete for this upcoming requirement. The applicable NAICS code is 722310 and the threshold established by the Small Business Administration is $38.5 million in annual revenues or less.

A Performance Work Statement is attached for potentially interested vendors to review.
 In order for the Government to make a determination, it is emphasized that all respondents should provide sufficient supporting information to indicate their capacity and capability to successfully meet the requirement. The information provided may or may not be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs. Responses should also include the following: (1) name and address of firm; (2) business size, including average annual revenue for past three years and number of employees; (3) ownership, indicating the following applicable business types: large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), woman-owned, HUBZone, and/or Veteran owned; (4) number of years in business; and (5) company point of contact, including name, title, phone, fax and e-mail address.

Although the Governments intention is to conduct the resulting acquisition as an 8(a) Small Business set-aside; the actual set-aside type may vary based on the responses received to this notice.
 Therefore, while 8(a) Small Businesses are encouraged to submit supporting information; other types of small businesses are not discouraged from doing so.  

This is NOT a request for quote or proposal (RFQ/RFP), invitation for bid (IFB), or an announcement of a solicitation as no solicitation package exists at this time. The request is for informal purposes only. NAVSUP FLCSD will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning only. No cost data should be submitted. Interested parties that submitted data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this notice or any follow-up information requests.
 Submittals will not be returned to the sender. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Electronic responses (i.e. email) are preferred and telephonic request for information will not be honored. No request for debrief will be honored as a result of this notice.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - A&E SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF RENOVATION OF BUILDING 239A AT MOFFETT FIELD

Architectural and Engineering Services - SOURCES SOUGHT - design phase, renovation of building 239A at NASA Ames Research Center (Moffett Field) in Mountain View, CA
The U.S. Geological Survey is beginning the process of moving from its current location in Menlo Park, CA to NASA Ames Research Park (Moffett Field) in Mountain View, CA.  The first phase, ongoing, involves the renovation of office space in building 19 at Moffett Field to support approximately 200 employees.  The second phase is the planned renovation of building 239A, which will house USGS' laboratory space.
The current laboratory space inventory in Menlo Park is approximately 60,000 square feet.  It is expected that approximately less than half of this inventory will fit in building 239A and so only the highest priority spaces will be relocated.  The scope of this effort is the architectural and engineering services necessary to support this move from the schematic design phase through construction administration, including laboratory programming/planning and design, cost estimating, and bid phase services.  We expect it will be necessary to "gut" building 239A down to the structure and to replace all systems with new.  We expect the period of performance from design through construction will be approximately two years, that the magnitude of construction will be in the tens of millions of dollars, and that the design phase magnitude will be in the several millions of dollars.
The applicable NAICS code is 541310, Architectural Services, with corresponding size standard $7.5M.  The purpose of this sources sought notice is to identify any interested and well-qualified small businesses so that we may determine whether it is appropriate to set this acquisition aside for participation by small business concerns, or whether it should be unrestricted.  
If you are interested in participating, please respond to this notice with a brief summary of your capabilities and your size status.  We would appreciate a response regardless of your size status.
Questions or concerns may be directed to the Contracting Officer by email to jcaravelli@usgs.gov or by phone at 916.278.9341.

The current process for booking a prisoner involves multiple different peripherals tethered to a desktop computer, openly housed on a stationary cart. Unsecured objects raise safety concerns, maintenance of non-standardized equipment across the enterprise is challenging, and different peripherals result in different fidelities of data being submitted to Next Generation Identification (NGI). An ideal replacement kiosk would not pose any risk to officer safety, allow USMS to standardize what equipment is being used across the enterprise, and enhance the data quality of captured biometrics.<br /><br />The specific details and requirements are in the attached document.&nbsp;</span></p>

Access shall include Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits for the POC databases, remote access via OpenAthens accounts, and mobile platforms to include various popular hand-held devices, for all physicians and all other health care providers across VISN 5.  These databases will serve to assist health care providers in their clinical decision making and drug information needs.

2.0 Background:  

VISN 5, which includes six main medical centers, affiliated Community Based Outpatient Clinics, and other physical work and off-site locations, requires online web access to searchable medical and drug references for retrieval of current, authoritative, and evidence-based medicine information for health care providers and patients. 

Electronic medical references reduce the need for multiple individual hard copies of expensive print resources and allow for cross searching multiple clinical information resources.  This method provides a more efficient manner of retrieving medically necessary information to meet the clinical mission of providing the best quality care to Veterans within VISN 5. 

Health care providers need these online tools to be available on VA networked and non-VA networked computers, both onsite and offsite, as well as on mobile devices, to have health information available to provide care for patients.

<DESC><p><br />Synopsis for PGK M1156 Adding Options 3-5 to Production Contract</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS), intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source, firm fixed price modification with Orbital Alliant Techsystems Operations LLC (OATK), 4700 Nathan Lane North, Plymouth, MN 55442 to add additional Options 3, 4 &amp; 5 to the current contract for the continued production of M1156 PGK's. This sole source modification is intended to be issued using 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as authorized by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A) and FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(B) Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements; supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The anticipated modification will include a First Article Acceptance Testing (FAAT) if required.<br /><br />The PGK is a guided artillery fuze that satisfies the need for all-weather capability. The PGK technology places capability in the hands of the Warfighter for 155mm High Explosive (HE) projectiles (M795 and M549A1) exceeding the threshold requirement for 50m accuracy capability. This capability decreases the likelihood of serious injury or death to US Soldiers. PGK is capable of accuracies &le; 50 meters, with a goal of &le; 30 meters, Circular Error Probable (CEP) of designated target location, with similar kinetic effects of current munitions. The PGK GPS guided precision fuze capability significantly enhances operational effectiveness and significantly reduces risk of dispersed units being overwhelmed by larger enemy forces. The PGK must be capable of maintaining the minimum reliability of 92% at time of delivery and for the first 10 years, after which PGK may have a minimum reliability of 89%.</p>
<p>This planned modification includes all efforts required to manufacture, inspect, test and deliver the M1156 PGK. Options 3, 4 and 5 will include production quantity ranges of:</p>
<p>4,000 - 6,000<br />6,001 - 8,000<br />8,001 - 10,000<br />10,001 - 15,000<br />15,001 - 24,000</p>
<p>First award under this planned modification is estimated to be in FY18 with delivery in FY20.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; Dear Interested Parties,
<p>Thank you for your consideration of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) forthcoming procurement titled Cargo Systems Application Development and Operations and Maintenance Support for Cargo Systems Program Directorate in support of cargo systems applications. The scope of the support required for this contract shall include but, is not limited to, Collections Features, Cargo Release/SE Features, Post Release Features, ITDS Single Window Features, and Manifest Features. The scope also includes cross-functional support for the Agile Teams. The Statement of Work (SOW) describes the work to be performed, specific timeframes, and required deliverables under a Time &amp;Material (T&amp;M) contract vehicle. Please see the attached DRAFT SOW for additional information.</p>
<p>The objective of this letter is to provide the Government's written notice of its intent to utilize the General Services Administration (GSA) Alliant Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Small Business (SB) contract vehicle using a best value selection decision. This acquisition will be conducted as a two-phased procurement, using a competitive down-selection technique between phases. In this technique, two or more Offeror's will be selected from Phase I. It is expected that one Offeror from Phase II will be selected for award after a competitive down-selection on the basis of best value to the Government. The competition for Phase II will be based on the results of Phase I, and the award criteria for Phase II will include successful completion of Phase I requirements. A single, awardee T&amp;M Task Order (TO) award is contemplated, as a result of this procurement. The Government anticipates an award date of November 2019, for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. However, the Government reserves the right to make no award at all.</p>
<p>GSA Alliant IDIQ SB consists of any and all components of an integrated IT solution, including all current and any new technologies which may emerge during the life cycle. In addition, the scope includes information technology systems and services in support of National Security Systems, as defined in FAR 39.002. It, also, provides IT Solutions through performance of a broad range of services which may include the integration of various technologies critical to the services being acquired. For additional information, please utilize the GSA Website.</p>
<p>The Government will be inviting GSA Alliant SB Holders ONLY to bid on this Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government will not address inquiries prior to the release of the solicitation. GSA Alliant SB Holders ONLY will have any opportunity to ask questions during the question and answer (Q&amp;A) period after the release of the RFP. Please be advised, the Government will not respond to any questions at this time in reference to this requirement. This information is being posted solely for informational purposes ONLY!</p>
<p>CBP anticipates that these services will adequately support the projected scope of the requirement. The Government estimates that the magnitude of the requirement is roughly between $350 and 450 million.</p>
<p>In an effort to facilitate the acquisition process, attached for your review is the draft version of the Cargo Systems Application Development and Operations and Maintenance Support SOW. The Government intends to pursue a streamlined acquisition approach for this requirement with a condensed solicitation timeframe. Therefore, the intent of releasing the SOW is to provide requirements information early in the acquisition process.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote or an invitation to bid, nor is it to be construed as a firm commitment by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. This notice does not constitute an "opt-out" response to this acquisition. Not responding to this request does not preclude a contractor from receiving a subsequent solicitation, when one is issued.</p>
<p>Information received will be used for internal CBP use only. Responses to this request are voluntary and the Government will not pay or reimburse any individuals or companies that respond to this request. Any costs incurred by interested companies are solely the responsibility of the contractor. The information provided by CBP in this statement and its attachment is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.<br />Thank you for your continued interest and support in supporting CBP's mission.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for Space Launch Systems (SLS) Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) launch attempt turnaround support. Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) requires between approximately 200,000 and approximately 500,000 gallons of LH2 cryogenic fuel to support refilling the launch complex 39B LH2 storage sphere following the first and potentially the second launch attempts of the SLS vehicle in the event that those attempts prove to be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>NASA/KSC intends to issue a modification to NASA purchase order NNK16OM16P under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). It has been determined that United Launch Services, LLC is the only potential contractor able to support the Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) launch attempt turnaround requirements. United Launch Services has an active LH2 storage sphere currently in use at Space Launch Complex 37 Pad B (SLC-37B). Furthermore, United Launch Services regularly receives, stores, and transfers LH2 at KSC and has developed the technical expertise required to transfer the aforementioned LH2 quantities during time sensitive launch attempt turnarounds. <br /><br />The NAICS Code for this contract action is 481212</p>

<a href="mailto:luis.cotto-arroyo@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Department of the Navy, Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Education (MPT&E) Transformation  Industry Day  The PMW 240 Sea Warrior Program Office cordially invites interested companies to the Department of the Navy (DoN) MPT&E Transformation Industry Day being conducted 22 May 2018, at Defense Acquisition University, Fort Belvoir, VA. This market research event is intended to serve two main objectives. First, it provides an update on the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations/Chief of Naval Personnels vision for the transformation of MPT&E IT systems. Second, it assists the Department of Navy in understanding industry capabilities, as well as existing and emerging technologies, that could support the information technology (IT) modernization for MPT&E Transformation. This event serves as continued market research under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 10.  Background The PMW 240 Sea Warrior Program Office is responsible for the (i) sustainment of the Navys pay & personnel IT systems and (ii) the transformation of Navys MPT&E systems to a COTS-based set of capabilities. PMW240 Program Office is supporting the Navys mission to modernize its MPT&E systems to ensure continued fleet readiness. The current processes and infrastructure are complex, outdated, costly, and inefficient. To serve the fleet of tomorrow, Navy must reimagine the way IT is designed and used. Strategically, the program seeks to maximize out-of-the-box (vanilla) COTS solutions where logical and feasible and minimize custom development of possible future solutions. Some level of customization may be required to meet Federal Government and/or DoD interface, regulatory, and statutory requirements.  Transformation Approach and the Integrated Solution MPT&E IT Transformation will consolidate the existing family of MPT&E programs (approx. 55) into a single system of systems which will be built on the core of existing capabilities. A successful 55 to 1 IT Transformation will improve business processes, integrate personnel and pay functions, and unify system data. MPT&E Transformation includes four key capability areas: Single Point of Entry (SPOE): Through the use of a multi-phased modernization approach, SPOE will provide an intuitive self-service for Sailors to view and manage personnel and career information. It consists of portal, identify management, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) components. This transformation of IT systems will significantly enhance the experience of Sailors and their families. Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2): Supports the configuration of the PeopleSoft 9.2 to meet Navy MPT&E requirements and enables auditability through the integration of a Direct to Treasury Pay capability. The NP2 solution suite will provide an integrated, vanilla COTS, cloud hosted, integrated personnel and pay solution that will provide the Navy with an IT system that is modern, highly automated, auditable, agile, responsive, and more efficient. Learning Stack (LS): Supports ready relevant learning, with a focus to align Navy learning, create a career learning continuum, and leverage evolving technologies to expand learning solutions when and where the Sailor needs them. Authoritative Data Environment (ADE): Serves as the single authoritative source for MPT&E data through the phased consolidation & migration of existing databases; enables improved system interoperability and data exchanges through the use of application programming interface technology. Provides the business analytics components of the MPT&E transformation, advancing data analytics and visualization capabilities.  Industry Day Details  Where: Defense Acquisition University, Building 226, Howell Auditorium, 9820 Belvoir Road, Fort Belvoir, VA, 22060  When: 22 May 2018.

<DESC>PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY
<p>BACKGROUND: A project labor agreement is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. &sect; 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 22.503 Policy provides that:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreements are a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will-</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law. (Refer also to FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement and FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement).</p>

<p>6. There are collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) for key trades that will expire during the course of the project.</p>
<p>7. The unique and compelling schedule requirements of a particular project (e.g., the project is tied to court-imposed deadlines or has a mission-critical schedule).</p>
<p>8. A PLA will provide an opportunity for registered apprentices to participate in the project.</p>
<p>9. A PLA would not contribute to the economy or efficiency for the project under consideration.</p>
<p>10. Any Additional Relevant Factors (Provide any additional project or situation specific details, information or factors (e.g., results of the labor market survey, other projects in the vicinity, etc.)</p>

<DESC>Request for Information:<br /><br />1. General. This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) and is for informational/market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR BID, NOR A SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION UNDER FAR SUBPART 5.2.
<p>2. Project Description. Portland District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (NWP) Regulating Outlet (RO) gates are currently controlled by hydraulic cylinders operating with traditional mineral oils at pressures from 800 to 1500 pounds per square inch (psi) working pressures. NWP is seeking alternative means to operate the gates reliably that reduces the environmental risk posed by utilizing RO gates which contain up to several thousand gallons of oil in the systems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to identify industry's availability and capability of producing large non-hydraulic operators for medium-to-large slide gates that control the flow of water through low-to-high head dams in NWP's area of responsibility. NWP is currently investigating the rehabilitation of up to 48 RO gates across numerous NWP flood control dams. <br /><br />Operational Requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; The application requires slide and roller gates to be driven up and down.<br />&bull; Range of application (lower bound): 5.5' x 6.5' gates operating at a maximum require up-force of 125,000lbf and uses a 4" stem. <br />&bull; Range of application (upper bound): 6.5' x 12.5' operating at a maximum require up-force of 650,000lbf and uses a 7" stem. <br />&bull; Range of current operator stem sizes: 4" to 8", detailed analysis has yet to be performed to verify stem sizing going forward.<br />&bull; Stem material shall be corrosion resistant stainless steel or material with equivalent performance.<br />&bull; Operating Speed ~0.5 ft/minute<br />&bull; Operators must have a proven track record. Similar size, application, and service life. References of past projects are highly desired. <br />&bull; Operator legacy support. NWP desires manufacturer support for a minimum of 20-25 years. Additionally, detail design of equipment must be provided at time of purchase. USACE is not looking for a "black box" and must be able to maintain operators after manufacturer production of spare parts end.<br />&bull; Usage: Assume 2 incremental operations of 1 foot per day plus 4 full open/close operations per year at full load. <br />&bull; Service life (minimum): 50 years at given usage before replacement is required. <br />&bull; Minimum duration between major services requiring significant teardown: 10 years <br />&bull; Operator must be able to fit through existing service hatches in dams. See drawing examples (Dorena and Hills Creek)<br />&bull; Operators must be physically fit in the existing equipment spaces while providing adequate access for operation and maintenance staff. <br />&bull; Operator must be able to be serviced by USACE staff (i.e. service required by manufacturers authorized representatives only is not acceptable).<br />&bull; Oils and lubricants must not enter the water passage. Oils should be kept to a minimum in general.</p>
<p>Other Information:</p>
<p>&bull; Gates, controls, power, will be new and designed by USACE, assume operator stem to be a bare threaded end at this time. <br />&bull; Power available is 480V</p>

The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation's Tam&aacute;stslikt Cultural Institute (TCI) currently provides professional care and management of the collection and property of articles belonging to four Native American tribes.</p>
<p>TCI Museum is uniquely qualified to continue to curate the Portland District collections because of their knowledge of cultural requirements and their sensitivity to the needs of the tribes.

<p>This acquisition is for the ongoing curation and management of Portland District collections housed at TCI. The services are for a FY 2018 base year contract, as well as three additional option years.</p>
<p>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE POSTED. The Government intends to proceed with this sole source action. The NAICS code is&nbsp;712110 - Museums. The size standard for this NAICS code is $27.5 Million&nbsp;defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR<br />QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement to the contracting officer before the notice end date. If no affirmative written responses are received by 02:00 PM local time on&nbsp;02 May&nbsp;2018, an award will be made without further notice.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing solicitation number 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 30 for Multiple Award Schedule 738X Human Capital Management & Administrative Support Services, effective April 27, 2018. 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 30 replaces solicitation number 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 29 in its entirety. 

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   

As part of GSA's continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings
Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing
To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  

Resultant contracts will be indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule program. Current contract holders under Schedule 738X do not need to re-apply. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this agency. Contracts under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award, and lasting for five years unless canceled or terminated. Three five-year option periods are possible under this contractual action.

The purpose of this solicitation is to provide a vehicle for all Government agencies to obtain quality Human Capital Management & Administrative Support Services when required from qualified and experienced Contractor(s) under a Multiple Award Federal Supply Schedule in an efficient, streamlined, and cost effective manner in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.
  
There are sixteen (16) Special Item Numbers (SINs) covered under Schedule 738X: 595-21 Agency Human Capital Strategy, Policy & Operational Planning, 595-2 Talent Acquisition, 595-3 Talent Development, 595-4 Employee Performance Management, 595-5 Compensation & Benefits, 595-6 Separation & Retirement, 595-7 Employee Relations, 595-8 Labor Relations, 595-9 Workforce Analytics & Employee Records, 595-10 Agency Human Capital Evaluation, 595-11 Administrative Support Services, 595-22 Private Shared Service Center for Core HR Services, 595-25 EEO Services, 595-26 Private Shared Service Center for Non-Core HR Services (offered by contractors awarded 595-22), 595-27 HR Support: Pre-Employment Background Investigations, and 595-28 Social Services, Professional Counseling and Veterans' Readjustment & Behavioral Health Services.

Solicitation 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 30 contains no open season for SINs 595-22 and 595-26 for private Shared Service Centers.

The previous edition of this solicitation, 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 29, will not be accepted after April 27, 2018.

<div>
<p>Contractors shall satisfy the following requirements: 1) Attachment I - Statement of Work, and 2) Attachment II - Daily Menu Meal.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Capability <br />1.1 - Ability to meet Government requirements in accordance with Attachment I - Statement of Work and Attachment II - Daily Menu Meal.<br />1.2 - Delivering One Sample Breakfast Burrito Meal from Attachment II - Daily Menu Meal by coordinating with Jose R. Munoz Jr., Contract Specialist via email jose.munoz@ice.dhs.gov regarding the date of delivery. The sample will be evaluated in accordance with the Attachment I - Statement of Work Section 1.2a, 1.2b, 1.2c, 1.2d, 1.5a, and 1.5c.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance<br />Past Performance Evaluation (Attachment VI) that the Offerors will submit to the cited client POC(s) for completion is included herein.  ICE requests that the Offerors have the evaluation submitted directly to ICE by the client POC by the due date established for the offer.  The evaluation shall be emailed directly to jose.munoz@ice.dhs.gov.  The contractor is solely responsible for ensuring timely submission.</p>
<p>In evaluating past performance, ICE will take into consideration the past performance assessments from the Offeror's references by submitting no more than 1 contract of similar scope, and complexity of this requirement and that were completed within the last three years from the closing date of the solicitation or which the Offeror is currently performing.  However, ICE reserves the right to use information it obtains through other sources (e.g., the Past Performance Information Retrieval System [PPIRS], interviews with previous clients/customers of the contractor and/or the ERO, other agency databases, etc.).  The assessment will address the Offeror's trend during contract performance, quality, source of the information, and the potential for successful performance in addition to the currency and relevance of the information received. The contractor is solely responsible for ensuring the timely submission of past performance evaluation forms [however, the bidder may confirm with Mr. Jose Mu&ntilde;oz on whether the forms have been submitted prior to the closing date/time of the solicitation].</p>
<p>Offerors are also advised that only relevant experience will be evaluated for the purposes of past performance; however, the absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably (i.e. neutral).</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price <br />The purpose of the price factor is to assess the reasonableness of the proposed price, including all options, and to assess the acceptability of, and correlation to the other business matters of the offer.  The results of the price evaluation shall also be used as an aid in determining each Offeror's understanding of the technical requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any offer that is unreasonable or materially unbalanced as to price for basic and option items including follow-on years may be rejected.  An unbalanced offer exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more Contract Line Item Numbers (i.e. CLINs) is significantly understated or overstated as indicated by price analysis techniques.</p>
<p>All 3 factors are approximately equal. The government will trade off for the best value and will not necessarily award to the highest rated or lowest price offeror. The contract will be awarded based on best value.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.</p>
<p>Offerors will complete the information in 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and submit their Representations and Certifications via SAM @ https://www.sam.gov.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.  Question due date for this synopsis/proposal is Wednesday, May 02, 2018, at 12:00pm, Pacific Standard Time. Closing date or response date for this synopsis/proposal is Monday, May 14, 2018, at 12:00pm, Pacific Standard Time.  Only written responses will be accepted.

<p>15. MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>16. WOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL (WPM) - ADDITIONAL DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>In accordance with the requirements of International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15, the following commercial heat treatment process has been approved by the American Lumber Standards Committee (ALSC) and is required for all Wood Packaging Material (WPM).

All WPM shall be constructed from Heat Treated (HT to 56 degrees Centigrade for 30 minutes) lumber and certified by an accredited agency recognized by the ALSC in accordance with Wood Packaging Material Policy and Wood Packaging Material Enforcement Regulations (see URL: http://www.alsc.org). All materials must include certification markings in accordance with ALSC standards and be placed in an unobstructed area that will be readily visible to inspectors. Pallet markings shall be applied to the stringer or block on diagonally opposite sides and ends of the pallet and be contrasting and clearly visible. All dunnage used in configuring and/or securing the load shall also comply with ISPM 15 and be marked with an ALSC approved "DUNNAGE" stamp. Failure to comply with the requirements of this restriction may result in refusal, destruction, or treatment of materials at the point of entry.</p>

<DESC>The USDA NRCS North Carolina State Office is in need to have wetland delineation and determinations completed in accordance with the attached Statement of Work. This agreement will result in a per acre price per county over the course of 5 years of wetland delineation and determination. Based on 2017 data; the average size of wetland determination requests are 20.2 acres.
<p>The deliverables apply to on-site field investigations for Preliminary Technical Determinations for Wetland Conservation issued by North Carolina NRCS.</p>
<p>Wetland determinations are conducted for USDA participants in order for them to maintain compliance with Wetland Provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended. These determinations are requested by the participant by submitting the Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation Certification form (AD-1026) at the local Farm Service Agency office. The AD-1026 is then transmitted to the local NRCS office. The AD-1026 request with relevant documentation gathered by the local NRCS personnel is then submitted to the NRCS State Office to review and record as a pending wetland determination request. Once the determination is conducted, a Preliminary Technical Determination (PTD) is sent to the participant outlining its results and the appeal rights afforded to the participant. Once received, the participant has 30 days to appeal the PTD. If no notification of appeal is submitted by the participant during the 30 day period, the PTD is then signed by NRCS and considered as an official certified wetland determination.</p>

<DESC>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM)<br />Architect and Engineering (A-E) Services <br />Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ)
<p><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: Architect-Engineer services are required for award of up to three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IDIQ) to support the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. The contract will be for one (1) base year and have options to extend for four (4) one-year option periods if the museum chooses to do so.  The total five year (base and four one-year options) estimated cost for all contracts is approximately $2,500,000.00 .  The guaranteed minimum quantity shall be $25,000.00. Offerors must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.</p>
<p>Task orders will be competed among the selected contractors in accordance with a fair opportunity process based on the A-E's, specialized experience, customer satisfaction, and project requirements. The work will be for facilities of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC and the state of Maryland. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Since opening in April, 1993, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has hosted over two million visitors annually. The Museum's exhibits and public programs are housed in a 258,000 square foot building, which in many ways evokes the Museum's subject matter. The Museum's staff offices are located primarily adjacent to the Museum in the Ross Administrative Center, a 45,000 square foot building which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in leased office space elsewhere in the District of Columbia. The Museum's Shapell Collections, Conservation and Research Center is located outside of the District of Columbia. Modifications need to be made to accommodate the Museum's evolving programs as well as to address a number of maintenance issues.</p>
<p>The Museum's Division of Operations is looking to issue IDIQ contracts with firms who will be able to design these adjustments in a manner which is architecturally compatible with either the Museum's or the Shapell Center's design aesthetic, or with the historic fabric of the Ross Administrative Center. These contracts will be overseen by the Museum Architect. As the projects are expected to range considerably in size, scope, and public visibility, it is anticipated that the Museum will establish contracts with multiple firms, at least one of which has an emphasis on historic preservation and materials conservation.</p>
<p>The following services are expected to be contracted for as part of these contracts: complete design services including the preparation of construction contract drawings, specifications and cost estimates, both preliminary and final; site investigations; planning studies; preparation of presentation drawings, models, and sample boards; programming; space layouts; tenant space plans; interior design, including furniture and finish selection; shop drawing reviews; value engineering; construction services; post-construction services; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services which may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. Some projects will be initiated as part of this contract, and flow from programming and schematic design through construction documentation. Other projects will be based upon schematic designs provided by the Museum Architect.   Design of exhibitions or new facilities are not anticipated to be contracted for as part of these contracts.</p>
<p>Examples of typical task orders are as follows: Water Infiltration Investigations; Exterior Facade Moisture Investigations and Analysis; Interior Climate; Investigation and Analysis; Data Center Improvements Design; Roof Designs/Structural Analysis; Space Analysis; ADA Compliance Design; Mechanical Upgrade/Improvement Design; Office Design/Occupied Space Reconfiguration.</p>
<p>The firm or firms selected shall have either in-house expertise or consultants with expertise in the following areas: architectural conservation, museum planning, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, structural engineering, fire protection engineering, and cost estimating.

Additional required expertise may be needed for a specific project, as required by the Government.</p>

In addition to traditional architectural presentation techniques, architectural drawings done as part of this contract shall be submitted in electronic format which is compatible with AutoCAD 2018, and done according to the guidelines established by the American Institute of Architects. Some of the task orders issued under this contract may require background checks of the firm's personnel, including criminal background checks.

<SOLNBR>70T05018Q9NRNF200
<RESPDATE>050718
<CONTACT>Kevin Newton, Email kevin.newton@tsa.dhs.gov
<DESC><br />(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is 70T05018Q9NRNF200 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97.</p>
<p>(iv) The acquisition is set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code is 611699 with a corresponding small business size standard of $11 million.</p>
<p>(v) Schedule<br />00001 - Base Year Firing Range Services, 800 hours<br />10001 - 1st Option Year Firing Range Services, 800 hours<br />20001 - 2nd Option Year Firing Range Services, 800 hours<br />30001 - 3rd Option Year Firing Range Services, 800 Hours<br />40001 - 4th Option Year Firing Range Services, 800 hours<br /><br />The Government anticipates the base year will start on 1 Jun 2018. All periods will have a 12-month period of performance (PoP). The initial (base) PoP will commence at contract award, which may be before or after 1 Jun 2018.&nbsp; Option period PoP dates will commence the day after the preceding period's PoP end date.<br /><br />(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Firing Range Services. All work shall be accomplished in accordance with the attached Statement of Work.<br /><br />Note regarding description of requirement: This is not a request to build a new firing range. It is for the use of a firing range, and it is anticipated that only existing ranges will meet the Government's requirements due to anticpoated start date of services. Further, the requirement is for the use of facilities only-the requirement does not include purchase of ammunition, targets, instructors/instruction (training), etc.</p>
<p>(vii) All work services are accomplished at the vendor's facility. <br /><br />(viii) The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items is not applicable. <br />Award will be made using a lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:<br /><br />1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:<br />Quotes that are not received timely<br />Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.<br /><br />3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.<br /><br />If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.<br /><br />4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.<br /><br />(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:<br />Factor 1. Technical Acceptability<br />Technical Acceptability will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:<br />Acceptable - A quoter will be determined technically acceptable based on their capabilities to perform the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work.<br />Unacceptable - A quoter will be determined technically unacceptable if their quote fails to demonstrate that they are capable of performing the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work.<br /><br />Factor 2. Past Performance<br />Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:<br />Acceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br /><br />Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."<br /><br />Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.<br /><br />Factor 3.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The purpose of this amendment is to address the following questions:</span></strong><br /><br /><strong>Question 1:</strong>&nbsp; <br />In the SOW it states:<br /><br />3.1.2.1 Detailed as built design drawings shall be furnished for both the<br />Medium and Small cabinets with each bid.<br /><br />3.2.1.1 The work chamber shall have a minimum inside dimensions of 50" W x<br />44" D x 32" H. Due to space restrictions, the work chamber shall not exceed<br />60'' W x 48'' D x 40'' H. Drawings with dimensions shall be submitted of the<br />equipment design within Thirty (30) days of contract award. (CDRL-4)</p>
<p>Are you requiring Built Design Drawings to be submitted with our bid on May<br />4th, or is this required within 30 days of award?<br /><br /><strong>Answer to Question 1:<br /></strong>Paragraph 3.1.2.1 and 3.3.1.1 of the Statement of Work has been changed to read:<br /><br />3.1.2.1 Specifications and general equipment design drawings shall be furnished for both the Medium and Small cabinets with each bid. The footprint of components and system, cabinet work area dimensions, door dimensions, and any orientation restrictions shall be included in the equipment bid.<br /><br />3.3.1.1 The work chamber shall have a minimum inside dimensions of 42" W x 42" D x 32" H. Due to space restrictions, the work chamber shall not exceed 48'' W x 48'' D x 40'' H. Detailed equipment drawings with dimensions shall be submitted of the equipment design within Thirty (30) days of contract award. The detailed drawings should indicate all utility locations, access points, waste collection site, and maintenance and service areas. (CDRL-4)<br /><br /><strong>Question 2:<br /></strong>On the four (4) "Medium" cabinets; the spec states that the minimum cabinet width is 50" and that each cabinet must have two (2) doors that can open a full 90 degrees, each with a minimum width of 42". This means that the minimum required width of each cabinet, with the doors open a full 90 degrees, is 134". Since there are four (4) cabinets in a row, the minimum 'available footprint' width should be 536" (44' 8"), but the SOW only shows an available width of 518" (43' 2"). Due to this space restriction, can we assume that it is okay for some of the doors to overlap each other when in<br />the open position?<br /><br /><strong>Answer to Question 2:<br /></strong>Yes. We don't have room to accommodate without some overlap of doors. Our current equipment doors overlap, and if someone is taking too long to close their door, you use the other side door.<br /><br /><strong>Question 3:</strong><br />On the track extensions for the medium cabinets: Section 1.1.1. states that two (2) external track assemblies should be included and Section 3.2.2.9 states that each cabinet should be designed with "the capability to extend the tracks outside of the cabinet". Is CCAD wanting to have the track extensions be shared between two cabinets so that the two provided extensions can service all four cabinets?<br /><br /><strong>Answer to Question 3:<br /></strong>Yes. The 2 cart track extensions will serve the 4 medium cabinets when lifting devices are required for heavy parts. Since this is not the majority of time, we only seek 1 external cart track per pair of side by side, like media cabinets.<br /><br /><strong>Question 4:</strong><br />Section 3.2.1.3 states available space to be 43'2"W x 11'2"D x 10"H. Can we assume that it was intended to be 10'H instead of 10"H?<br /><br /><strong>Answer to Question 4:<br /></strong>Yes.</p>

<DESC>Questions Related to 36C24118Q0300

1. The vendor shall provide a means for error detection concurrent with data entry such that the data entry operator can provide a clearly visible indicator or the error on the form itself.  This is accomplished by identification of each range error and unacceptable data on the physical form by  tagging  (i.e., using small yellow self-adhesive notes) the form at the point of error with a brief description of the error, (i.e.,  column 26 out of range ,  left blank , etc.).
The scope requires the creation of data entry program, hence relying on technology to collect the data from the form. The step above requires manual intervention. Will the government accept "tagging" of images of forms instead of "tagging" of paper forms?  
Answer from NEPEC: No.  The paper tags protruding from the edge of the paper forms serves as a cue to NEPEC staff who then takes appropriate corrective action. An electronic tag  on form images would not provide this cue.
2. NEPEC requires that the vendor complete data entry for a given form within a maximum of three business days from its submission for jobs as defined by one crate.  
What is the estimated count that we will receive in a crate? 
       Answer from NEPEC:       One crate typically holds approximately 800 PTSD forms, or about 9600 individual pages within folders; in addition, one crate typically holds approximately 1000 double-sided VSS forms, typically not separated within folders.  PTSD requires processing of about 250-400 forms every two weeks, placed in one crate.. VSS  requires processing of about 1800-2250 forms every two months, placed in two or more crates.
3. The vendor is responsible for initiating and maintaining a system for transportation of all forms and products.  All costs associated with the transportation of the forms shall be the responsibility of the vendor 
The Price schedule provides total counts of the four form types processed in base year and option years. So if there are 11000 VSS forms in one year what will be typical lot size that we receive and how many different times will we receive VSS forms n a year?
Answer from NEPEC: VSS  requires processing of about 1800-2250 forms every two months, although this schedule can vary depending upon NEPEC s needs.
4. In order to aid the vendor in estimating the costs for the DPP, included is an example of a column coded style form, representative of the forms currently used at NEPEC.  The column-coded style is used by approximately 90 percent of the forms.  The column-coded style primarily uses numbers as allowable values (approx. 90%), but may also require mixed case, date formatting and mixed alpha and numeric fields requiring range checks (approx. 10%). 
Not clear as to whether these forms are single pages (front + back) stapled together, or in booklet form ( for example a 6-page form is created using a folded 11 X 17 and an 8 1/2 X 11 insert), or in some other format.
Answer from NEPEC:  All pages are 8  x 11 inches; PTSD forms are stapled upper left corner, 5-6 single-sided pages. VSS form is double-sided, 1 page.
We understand that collection services need to be performed in the USA. Our teaming partner is a global outsourcing company and our technology platform for data entry and data capture will be configured and customized in India- we cannot divulge our intellectual knowledge to local US vendors without incurring significant competitive harm. Will the government have an objection to this?
Answer from NEPEC:  The intention of the contract is to have all work performed in the USA and no processes beholden to any company outside of the USA. The purpose is to protect sensitive information contained on the forms which may or may not, even in the aggregate, divulge information to foreign interests.

Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that:

(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.

<DESC>Amendment 2 - The purpose of this amendment is to clarify if vendors are to provide one hard copy or assume 150 copies and base a price per copy. Vendors need to provide the cost to create only one copy of the book. While NLS may, from time to time order between two (2) and 150 copies of a title, NLS currently orders 102 copies per title and we anticipate the majority of upcoming orders will be for approximately that many copies per title.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM)<br />Architect and Engineering (A-E) Services <br />Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ)
<p><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: Architect-Engineer services are required for award of up to three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IDIQ) to support the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. The contract will be for one (1) base year and have options to extend for four (4) one-year option periods if the museum chooses to do so.  The total five year (base and four one-year options) estimated cost for all contracts is approximately $2,500,000.00 .  The guaranteed minimum quantity shall be $25,000.00. Offerors must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.</p>
<p>Task orders will be competed among the selected contractors in accordance with a fair opportunity process based on the A-E's, specialized experience, customer satisfaction, and project requirements. The work will be for facilities of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC and the state of Maryland. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Since opening in April, 1993, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has hosted over two million visitors annually. The Museum's exhibits and public programs are housed in a 258,000 square foot building, which in many ways evokes the Museum's subject matter. The Museum's staff offices are located primarily adjacent to the Museum in the Ross Administrative Center, a 45,000 square foot building which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in leased office space elsewhere in the District of Columbia. The Museum's Shapell Collections, Conservation and Research Center is located outside of the District of Columbia. Modifications need to be made to accommodate the Museum's evolving programs as well as to address a number of maintenance issues.</p>
<p>The Museum's Division of Operations is looking to issue IDIQ contracts with firms who will be able to design these adjustments in a manner which is architecturally compatible with either the Museum's or the Shapell Center's design aesthetic, or with the historic fabric of the Ross Administrative Center. These contracts will be overseen by the Museum Architect. As the projects are expected to range considerably in size, scope, and public visibility, it is anticipated that the Museum will establish contracts with multiple firms, at least one of which has an emphasis on historic preservation and materials conservation.</p>
<p>The following services are expected to be contracted for as part of these contracts: complete design services including the preparation of construction contract drawings, specifications and cost estimates, both preliminary and final; site investigations; planning studies; preparation of presentation drawings, models, and sample boards; programming; space layouts; tenant space plans; interior design, including furniture and finish selection; shop drawing reviews; value engineering; construction services; post-construction services; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services which may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. Some projects will be initiated as part of this contract, and flow from programming and schematic design through construction documentation. Other projects will be based upon schematic designs provided by the Museum Architect.   Design of exhibitions or new facilities are not anticipated to be contracted for as part of these contracts.</p>
<p>Examples of typical task orders are as follows: Water Infiltration Investigations; Exterior Facade Moisture Investigations and Analysis; Interior Climate; Investigation and Analysis; Data Center Improvements Design; Roof Designs/Structural Analysis; Space Analysis; ADA Compliance Design; Mechanical Upgrade/Improvement Design; Office Design/Occupied Space Reconfiguration.</p>
<p>The firm or firms selected shall have either in-house expertise or consultants with expertise in the following areas: architectural conservation, museum planning, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, structural engineering, fire protection engineering, and cost estimating.

In addition to traditional architectural presentation techniques, architectural drawings done as part of this contract shall be submitted in electronic format which is compatible with AutoCAD 2018, and done according to the guidelines established by the American Institute of Architects. Some of the task orders issued under this contract may require background checks of the firm's personnel, including criminal background checks.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97, effective 24 January 2018.
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded on a limited source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following part:</p>
<p>Item Name: YAW Trim Servo<br />Part Number: 70400-002260-121 / CU09603213<br />National Stock Number: 1680-01-242-2066<br />Quantity: 12 Each<br />Manufacturer Cage Code: 78286 (Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.), and 05088 (Kearfott Corporation)<br />Required Delivery: 30-Jul-2018</p>
<p>All parts shall have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. (Cage Code 78286), or Kearfott Corporation (Cage Code 05088). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.

<p>All parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is for&nbsp;Dining Facility Attendant (DFA) in support of the Logistics Readiness Center (LRC), located at Fort Bliss, Texas. The information received will be used within the Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center - Fort Sam Houston (MICC Center -FSH) to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the organization.</p>
<p><strong>This announcement is for planning and informational purposes only and SHALL NOT be considered an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Request for Proposal (RFP). There is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this Sources Sought Synopsis. This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis or reimburse respondents for information solicited, and provided. No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.</strong></p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The MICC Center - FSH has a requirement in support of the Fort Bliss Installation food service requirements. The Contractor shall provide quality services in support of the installation food service program that supports the Warfighter with flexible, efficient, and cost effective service. The service outlined in this requirement encompasses Dining Facility Attendant functions such as dining facility management functions, facility sanitation and janitorial duties.</p>
<p>The NAICS code assigned to the acquisition is 722310, Food Service Contractors with a corresponding small business size standard of $38.5M. The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, personnel, equipment, materials, and supplies, with the exception of Government Furnished Property (GFP, expendables), to perform activities that comprise the full operation of an Army Dining Facility and Full Food Services.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT: To request information on capabilities of potential offerors to provide the services described herein to determine if this will be set-aside. Please note, FFS requirements are subject to both the priority established by the Randolph-Sheppard Act (RSA) and the preferences set out in FAR part 19. Randolph-Sheppard Act Applies to this requirement.</p>
<p>-All offerors are hereby notified that this solicitation will be subject to the Randolph-Sheppard Act. The Army applies this priority in accordance with Army Regulation 210-25 (which will be incorporated into the solicitation and resulting contract). A priority right to operate dining facilities on federal property applies as defined in Army Regulation 30-22. This notice is not designed to discourage competition; rather, it sets out the priority established by the RSA for proposals received from State Licensing Agencies and their blind vendors.</p>
<p>A decision to set-aside this requirement for a small business program or to compete it through full and open procedures has not yet been made.</p>
<p>RESPONSES REGARDING POTENTIAL SOURCES STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES: Interested Offerors having the required specialized capabilities / qualifications to support some or all of the work described in the draft PWS are asked to answer the following questions and submit a capability statement. Capability statements shall contain the following information:</p>

<p>2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>3. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, time frame, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>4. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>5. Specify any conflicts and/or concerns with the procurement of both DFA and FFS under one contract vehicle.</p>
<p>6. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition. Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>7. Recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>

Firms interested in attending a site visit will meet on Tuesday, April 17, 2018 at 10 AM local time at Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge, 4009 Hill Road, Tule Lake, CA 96134-9715.

The following is the current Statement of Work of the required tasks. 


1. General

The purpose of this contract is to remove lead shot from the soil of an abandoned small arms range at Tule Lake NWR per the attached Work Plan.  The Work Plan was prepared by Ahtna Environmental Inc. (Ahtna) to guide field staff in the future cleanup of lead associated with the former small arms firing range at the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  The location and layout of the Tule Lake NWR firing range is shown on Figures 1 and 2.  The purpose of the attached Work Plan is to document site specific ecological risk-based threshold concentration (RBTC) for lead, proposed remedial action areas, the methods that will be utilized for the removal, dust management protocols, disposal requirements, and backfill and grading requirements.

Camp Tule Lake is a culturally significant property on the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge that served as a civilian conservation center and segregation facility.  The camp was established by the U.S. government in 1935 to accommodate vocational trainees as part of the expansion of available land for the Klamath Reclamation Project.  During World War II the camp was used for sheltering Japanese American strikebreakers, imprisoning Japanese American dissidents, and housing Italian and German prisoners of war.  After the war, on 25 April 1946, the camp was transferred from the Army back to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service).  In 2008, Camp Tule Lake was included as part of the larger Tule Lake Unit when it was designated as the WWII Valor in the Pacific National Monument.  Camp Tule Lake is currently co-managed by the Service and the National Park Service (NPS).  The purpose of the Tule Lake Unit is to preserve, study, and interpret the history and setting of the incarceration and later segregation of Japanese Americans at Tule Lake during World War II.

2. Scope
The Contractor shall:
-  Remove the lead from the soil located at the abandoned Firing Range (Camp Tule Lake) within Tule Lake NWR per Ahtna Work Plan dated 01/10/2017.  
-  Remaining soils on site shall be below occupational ESL of 320 mg/kg.
-  Once clearance sampling analysis is complete and approved, site restorations shall take place.  The disturbed areas shall be graded and returned to match the surrounding topography; removed vegetation shall be piled up and left on site.  
-  Lead and lead contaminated soils shall be disposed of and/or recycled IAW federal, state, and local regulations.
-  All equipment shall be clean and free of vegetation and dirt prior to arrival at the refuge.

3. Deliverables
-  Contractor shall provide a summary report as outlined in Section 6 of the attached work plan.  Final draft report shall include 2 hard copies and an electronic version in PDF format; contractor will provide copies of all electronic files to include Word, Excel, CADD, photos, etc.

1. General

The purpose of this contract is to remove lead shot from the soil of an abandoned small arms range at Tule Lake NWR per the attached Work Plan.  The Work Plan was prepared by Ahtna Environmental Inc. (Ahtna) to guide field staff in the future cleanup of lead associated with the former small arms firing range at the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  The location and layout of the Tule Lake NWR firing range is shown on Figures 1 and 2.  The purpose of the attached Work Plan is to document site specific ecological risk-based threshold concentration (RBTC) for lead, proposed remedial action areas, the methods that will be utilized for the removal, dust management protocols, disposal requirements, and backfill and grading requirements.

Camp Tule Lake is a culturally significant property on the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge that served as a civilian conservation center and segregation facility.  The camp was established by the U.S. government in 1935 to accommodate vocational trainees as part of the expansion of available land for the Klamath Reclamation Project.  During World War II the camp was used for sheltering Japanese American strikebreakers, imprisoning Japanese American dissidents, and housing Italian and German prisoners of war.  After the war, on 25 April 1946, the camp was transferred from the Army back to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service).  In 2008, Camp Tule Lake was included as part of the larger Tule Lake Unit when it was designated as the WWII Valor in the Pacific National Monument.  Camp Tule Lake is currently co-managed by the Service and the National Park Service (NPS).  The purpose of the Tule Lake Unit is to preserve, study, and interpret the history and setting of the incarceration and later segregation of Japanese Americans at Tule Lake during World War II.

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;">4/27/18 - This Notice of Intent has been canceled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Notice of Intent</div>
<p>The Office of Acquisition and Agreement Management (OAAM), of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the NIST Laboratories, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with COMSOL Inc. of Burlington, MA, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 for the procurement of one-year COMSOL Multiphysics Software License maintenance subscription.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) at NIST intends to procure the required software maintenance under a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Commercial Items (FAR Parts 12 and 13). <br />The NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML)'s COMSOL Software maintenance subscription expires on May 31, 2018 and PML needs to maintain the COMSOL's Software subscription until May 31, 2019 to ensure NIST PML scientists' ability to conduct their research.</p>
<p>Multiphysics software allows coupling together of different material domains.  For adequate simulations for many applications this coupling together of responses from these different domains needs to be considered to accurately predict/understand the material properties of interest, whether these are mechanical, thermal, or electrical.  It also allows for simulation of fluid flow in microfluidic circuits, and the coupling of fluid flow in microfluidic circuits to the above-mentioned domains.</p>
<p><br />COMSOL's base package is simulation software for solving partial differential equations using a finite-element approach.  It is implemented as a base package with a number of application-specific optional modules that can be added on.  The power of this Multiphysics approach is that simulations from different traditional "domains" can be coupled together, for example, RF/microwave, thermal, mechanical, fluidic.  For instance, with the COMSOL base package along with the RF module and the thermal management module, one can solve problems involving microwave heating.  With the microfluidic module, one can study microwave heating in microfluidic circuits, and the influence of electromagnetic fields and heating effects on fluid flow.</p>
<p>Only COMSOL has the unique capabilities of providing the identical types of software as required to ensure NIST PML scientists ability to conduct their research.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />COMSOL is the sole source provider for the required software and is the only vendor able to provide the software that meets the Government's minimum requirements, which makes them uniquely qualified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 511210, with a size standard of $38.5 million.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by May 5, 2018 at 11:59 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Instruction to Responders: </strong><br />Companies that are capable of providing this Software License are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Sedigah.Gizabi@nist.gov no later than the response date for this notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this notice:</p>
<p>1<strong>.	Interested parties must be COMSOL authorized re-sellers and must provide evidence of being a COMSOL authorized re-seller. </strong></p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ (NAWCADLKE) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Kranze Technology Solutions, Inc. for build functional Digital Interoperability Suite (DIS) systems in three (3) iterations of six (10) B-Kit assemblies (total of thirty (30)), and ten (10) A-Kit Aircraft modifications (total of thirty (30)) in accordance with (IAW) the Government approved technical documentation completed. The RORO CS also requires Air Crew Digital Interoperability (D.I) Kits. The Air Crew D.I kits provide the software applications to send and receive the non-voice information to/from all personnel. The Air Crew D.I Kits have to be integrated and updated to be compatible with both "A" and "B" kits. This requirement is for a total quantity of thirty (30) "B" kits, thirty (30) "A" kits and twenty three (23) Air Crew D.I Kits. <br /><br />Each iteration shall include but not limited to aircraft modification for A-Kit, assembly of B-Kit, installation, check and test of entire DIS to specification indicated in the technical documents and/or additional B-Kits as need is determined by the Government. The contractor shall upgrade services on emerging Command, Control, Communications, Computers, &amp; Intelligence (C4I) suite of equipment known as the Roll On/Roll Off Communication Suite (RORO CS). The RORO CS delivers full gateway functionality with sub-systems known as "B-Kits" to send and receive real-time SECRET and below mission critical (non-voice) information (e.g. imagery, Full Motion Video (FMV), intelligence updates, isolated personnel report files, and position location information to Higher Headquarters (HHQ). The sub-systems known as the "A-Kits" are the modification, installation, and associated ancillary components required to mount "B-Kits" into MV-22 aircraft.
<p><br />NAWCADLKE intends to award this contract under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (C)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.</p>

<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking sources for Global Information Technology (IT) Service Desk Support Services.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:</p>
<p>Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization<br />P.O. Box 549<br />Fort Meade, Maryland 20755</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses (including the following subsets, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Woman Owned Small Business) to provide the required services.</p>
<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency is seeking information for potential sources for Global IT Service Desk Support for Tier I (Service Desk Support) and Tier II (Desktop Support) services throughout DISA and its customers. The Tier I services are to be performed at the contractor's facility, but required to be reachable from worldwide customers. Tier II services must be performed at Government facilities, located at 42 site locations within CONUS and OCONUS. This supports approximately 1,750,000 users. The current support environment consists of UNIX and Microsoft Windows systems providing support to Mission Partners user communities on a 24/7/365 basis.<br />The objective is to have a globally accessible Service Desk available to the agency and its customers.</p>
<p>DISA operates and maintains the Agency's internal Information Technology (IT) Enterprise, which provides administrative computing services to the DISA<br />Director, the majority of the Agency's civilian, military and contractor personnel and secure workspaces located within industry partner's commercial facilities. DISA's Information Technology (IT) Enterprise provides internal unclassified, secret, and top secret communications across DISA's worldwide locations. High visibility customers include the Pentagon and the White House Communication Agency.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: <br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Contract Number/Task Order: HC1047-13-D-4003/0003<br />Contract Type: FFP<br />Incumbent and their size: Unitech Consulting, LLC., Small 8(a)<br />Method of previous acquisition: 8(a) Competitive Set-Aside</p>
<p>Brief description of current effort: The current effort covers five (5) DISA locations that support Tier I (Service Desk) services, while Tier 2 (Desktop Support) services are provided at limited DISA locations. To provide additional flexibility and efficiency, the new requirement for Tier I services moves the place of performance to the contractor's facility with NIPRNet and SIPRNet connectivity. Tier II services will still be required to be performed at the Government facilities but it is required to be extended to support all 42 locations.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES <br />Please describe your experience delivering the following capabilities:</p>
<p>1) Service Desk Support Services (Tier I) - provide services at a Contractor's U.S. based primary and secondary (COOP) Facility Clearance at the SECRET level IAW DoD 5220.22, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. This SECRET level clearance requirement applies to affiliates, team members, subcontractors, etc., that will require access to classified information. All Tier I services provided from the Contractor's US-based primary and secondary (COOP) facilities must have network connectivity to NIPRNet and SIPRNet networks. The contractor's response should confirm that their facility has both NIPR and SIPR access at the time of this sources sought. The contractor's response should also show their ability to provide Service Desk Support on a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year basis to approximately 1.7M users world-wide, either directly or indirectly based on application service level agreement requirements. Most of these users are expected to need Tier 1/Level 1 support and Tier 1 Level 2 support.</p>
<p>These services would support approximately 1,750,000 users across the globe. The current environment operates according to a 'level' and 'tier' support model. The 'levels' represent proximity of Service Desk agents to mission partners/customers, whereas the 'tiers' within those levels represent the different skill sets of the service desk agents. The various Tiers provide support that corresponds with levels of proximity to the end user. Tier I is a virtualized service desk with local support provided by dispatch labor. Touch labor only pertains to the DISA internal support network.</p>
<p>Level 1 represents direct user support; Level 2 represents Service Desk-to-Service Desk support; and Level 3 represents external entities' support to the service desk (e.g. software vendor help desk support to internal service desks). This 'level' and 'tier' support model utilizes an enterprise trouble ticket workflow, an enterprise contact management system and knowledge centered support known as the Service Support Environment.</p>
<p>2) Desktop Support Services (Tier II) - provide touch labor services at the DISA site locations. There are approximately 42 site locations within CONUS and OCONUS.</p>
<p>3) Hire contractor personnel that are citizens of the United States who possess a U.S. Secret Clearance. The contractor must have credible processes that demonstrate a complete and thorough ability to perform complete background checks and security clearances on 100% of contractor personnel.</p>
<p>4) Provide Certified HDI Support Center Analysts</p>
<p>5) Provide certified HDI Desktop Support Technicians (HDI-DST).</p>
<p><br />SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Onsite staff will require at least a minimum Secret Security Clearance with IT-1.</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT: <br />The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541513, with the corresponding size standard of $27.5 million. This Sources Sought Synopsis is requesting responses to the following criteria ONLY from small businesses that can provide the required services under the NAICS Code. <br />To assist DISA in making a determination regarding the level of participation by small business in any subsequent procurement that may result from this Sources Sought, you are also encouraged to provide information regarding your plans to use joint venturing (JV) or partnering to meet each of the requirements areas contained herein. This includes responses from qualified and capable Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses, and 8(a) companies.

<DESC><p>Please see attached solicitation<br /><br />Construction Project:<br /><br />U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, requires restoration of a barrier dune on Empire Spit located in Tokeland, Washington in Willapa Bay.  The dune will be restored by the hydraulic dredging of approximately 600,000 cubic yards from an established in-water borrow site (approximately 1.5 miles from the borrow site to the dune location) and placement by hydraulic pipeline. The work needs to be performed over a period of one construction season estimated between June 2018 and February of 2019. The purpose of the work is to restore the entire length of an approximately 12,500 ft. long existing dune to its authorized height of 25 ft. MLLW. The dune has been severely eroded in certain areas due to recent wave and storm activity. The dune will require shaping to meet dune cross section profile requirements. The use of a hydraulic cutterhead suction or hopper dredge is acceptable. There is not land based access to the site, therefore all heavy equipment used to shape the dune must be mobilized and demobilized to/from the site via water.</p>
<p>The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE:<br />All contractors proposing on Department of Defense (DoD) solicitations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a contract. The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information and capabilities to the Government. The SAM website can be accessed at www.sam.gov. Contractors are encouraged to register as soon as possible. All new contracts can be made ONLY to contractors who are registered in SAM. This requirement applies to all DoD contract awards.</p>

Justification and Approval (J&A) 
For 
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K) 
Acquisition Plan Action ID:__ 688-18-3-078-0077 
1. Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 05, Washington DC Medical Center 

2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: Award of an annual service contract for an onsite specialist to support Storz instrumentation, endoscopes, and other Storz products at the Washington DC VA Medical Center (DC VAMC). 

3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs: 

The Washington DC VA Medical Center needs an onsite specialist to service and support the Storz instrumentation, endoscopes, and other Storz products in the operating rooms. The onsite specialist must be trained and certified to maintain all Storz products. The onsite specialist must assist with the maintenance and operation of the video integration system used by the DC VAMC s 5 operating rooms and provides video feeds to the conference room and a physician s office. The onsite specialist shall provide education, make repairs to the OR 1 system, and be responsible for managing the repairs of the instrumentation and scopes. 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

( x ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1; 
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2; 
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability 
or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3; 
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4 
( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; 
( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6; 
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7; 
5. Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): 

Karl Storz is uniquely qualified to provide an onsite certified specialist that meets all the DC VAMC s requirements. Their specialists are trained to support the OR 1 system. They have all the training, knowledge, and expertise needed to properly support the Operating Room staff. Additionally, they are uniquely able to repair the instrumentation and scopes as they are the OEM for the equipment using all OEM parts. They have designed and installed the system and are the original equipment Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP Attachment 3: Request for Sole Source Justification Format >$150K

manufacturer for a majority of the equipment in the system. All system components were purchased from them. 
Additionally, if the onsite specialist service contract is not renewed it will put a significant strain on resources within Biomedical Engineering and within the OR making it incredibly difficult to support this system and other systems in the OR. The integration system is very complicated and consists of many different components. A trained specialist needs to be available during surgeries to ensure proper functionality of the system. The specialist is frequently called upon to support the system intraoperatively. The lack of a specialist is likely to cause case delays in the OR. The instrumentation is also frequently damaged and is costly to repair without a service contract. This will impact turnaround times for equipment and may ultimately impact ability to perform surgical cases. 
6. Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: 

Karl Storz is the only group that can provide adequate onsite support to support the OR 1 system. They have the training, knowledge, and expertise needed to properly support the Operating Room staff. Additionally, they are uniquely able to repair the instrumentation and scopes as they are the OEM for the equipment using all OEM parts. Market research found that there are numerous 3rd party companies that can repair rigid and flexible scopes, but there are no other companies that can provide the range of services and repairs that are encompassed within the scope of work. These companies do not provide onsite support to manage and provide technical support for the OR 1 system and to manage and track the repairs to the instrumentation, scopes, and equipment. The OR1 integration system is a unique installation to the Washington DC VA and having an onsite specialist trained specifically in our installation and by the manufacturer and installer is a service only Storz can provide. This specialist has access to a variety of technical support from Storz, which other companies would not have. 
7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: 

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: 
No other sources were sought. Market research found that there are numerous 3rd party companies that can repair rigid and flexible scopes, but these companies do not provide onsite support to manage and provide technical support to the OR 1 system and to manage and track the repairs to the instrumentation, scopes, and equipment.
