**NON-MANUFACTURING RULE (NMR)**

The requirement that a Non-Manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R. § 121.406].  In order to qualify as a small business concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R. § 125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States.

ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as set-aside for SDVOSB.  The applicable NAICS code is 334510.   The solicitation will be issued on or about October 4, 2019 for approximately ten (10) business days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety.  In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at james.carson2@va.gov AND sandra.johnson3@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please see attached Sources Sought Synopsis for full details.</span></strong>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong>
<div>1.<strong> Sources Sought Synopsis for Planning Purposes.</strong> This is a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 --Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to perform market research, and to determine interest and capability in providing F-15C/E MTC simulation services to the Air Force.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>a. Background: The Government is conducting market research to identify companies, as potential sources, that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide F-15C and F-15E military flight simulator services for the F-15C and F-15E Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC simulator service contract (currently projected to end 30 December 2020).  Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.  These services are provided by the incumbent who owns all simulator devices. It is the Government's intention to determine whether there is offeror interest and capability in performing a simulator services contract.</p>
<p>(1) The Combat Air Force's (CAF) Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) program is utilizing simulation services at ACC, PACAF, and USAFE main operating bases for F-15C, F-15E, and other platforms, with interoperability between sites provided via the DMO Network (DMON). The F- 15C/E MTC System Program Office at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capabilities that ensures the simulators maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. This capability is provided through a military flight simulator services contract.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Government does not own these simulators.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(2) The Air Force plans to continue with a combined military flight simulator services contract for both the F-15C and F-15E MTCs at no less than two (2) locations and no more than five (5) locations that may include three (3) USAF CONUS bases and two (2) OCONUS bases. Contractors will be responsible for maintaining their simulation services concurrent with changes to aircraft and weapons operating at the respective locations. Each F-15C and F-15E site will connect into the DMON and will have to meet the CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com). An associate contract agreement with the network provider and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of DMO integration.</p>
<p>(3)	The Government cannot provide full access to all software and other technical data currently in use by the incumbent. Attached is a list of software and other technical data in which the Government has some level of restricted use rights.</p>
<p>(4)<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Government does not currently have funds budgeted to purchase simulators and so, at this time, the new contractor would be required to secure/acquire/develop the required equipment. The Government does not expect to have funding in advance of contract performance to pay for development/procurement of simulators (sometimes referred to as "preparatory services"). All development/procurement costs to the contractor to develop high fidelity simulators are at the contractor's own expense. At this time, we envision the winning contractor will be awarded the contract in advance of contract performance in order to secure/acquire/develop the required equipment but no funding would be available to pay the contractor for that effort. Only after simulator availability was provided would the Government begin paying the contractor. </span></strong></p>
<div>
<p>b. Please email any questions as soon as possible and your response to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 1500 EST, 08 November 2019, to Amy Dromey (amy.dromey@us.af.mil), Contract Negotiator. Emailed response must be received no later than the above-mentioned time/date for the Government to consider your response in formulating our market research.&nbsp;</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK 

Shooting Range Usage for VA Police Yearly Qualifications

Introduction/Background

The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System provides quality health care to veterans using the abilities of all employees supported by our commitment to education and research.

The VA Police is the uniformed law enforcement service of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, responsible for the protection and security of the VA Medical Centers and other facilities such as Outpatient Clinics (OPC) and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) operated by the VA. The VA Police have several divisions and operate separately but alongside the VA Law Enforcement Training Center (VA LETC) under the umbrella of the Office of Security and Law Enforcement. The primary role of VA Police is to serve as a protective uniformed police force in order to deter and prevent crime, maintain order, and investigate crimes (ranging from summonses to felony offenses) which may have occurred within the jurisdiction of the Department or its federal assets. Some cases are investigated in conjunction with agents from the Office of the Inspector General (VA OIG).
The VA Police are an armed, federal law enforcement and protective service entity that operates in and around the various Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, National Cemeteries and other VA facilities located throughout the whole of United States to include Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Among others, the VA Police are a specialized federal law enforcement agency, whose officers have full police powers derived from statutory authority to enforce all federal laws, VA rules and regulations, and to make arrests on VA controlled property whether owned or leased. In the event of an active shooter the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Police need to be properly equipped to safeguard Veteran patients, employees and visitors. 

Per VA Directive 0720, Veterans Affairs Police Officers must qualify with the department firearm four times per year for regular qualification and low light qualification.
Because of this required firearm training, range time is needed on a yearly schedule. The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System has no shooting ranges on property. In order to qualify, the VA Police must purchase indoor/outdoor range hours from two ranges in the tri-state area.  

Requirements/Objective

  Indoor/Outdoor Firearm Shooting Range Usage

STATEMENT OF WORK 

Shooting Range Usage for VA Police Yearly Qualifications   

Introduction/Background

The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System provides quality health care to veterans using the abilities of all employees supported by our commitment to education and research.

The VA Police is the uniformed law enforcement service of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, responsible for the protection and security of the VA Medical Centers and other facilities such as Outpatient Clinics (OPC) and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) operated by the VA. The VA Police have several divisions and operate separately but alongside the VA Law Enforcement Training Center (VA LETC) under the umbrella of the Office of Security and Law Enforcement. The primary role of VA Police is to serve as a protective uniformed police force in order to deter and prevent crime, maintain order, and investigate crimes (ranging from summonses to felony offenses) which may have occurred within the jurisdiction of the Department or its federal assets. Some cases are investigated in conjunction with agents from the Office of the Inspector General (VA OIG).
The VA Police are an armed, federal law enforcement and protective service entity that operates in and around the various Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, National Cemeteries and other VA facilities located throughout the whole of United States to include Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Among others, the VA Police are a specialized federal law enforcement agency, whose officers have full police powers derived from statutory authority to enforce all federal laws, VA rules and regulations, and to make arrests on VA controlled property whether owned or leased. In the event of an active shooter the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Police need to be properly equipped to safeguard Veteran patients, employees and visitors. 

Per VA Directive 0720, Veterans Affairs Police Officers must qualify with the department firearm four times per year for regular qualification and low light qualification.
Because of this required firearm training, range time is needed on a yearly schedule. The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System has no shooting ranges on property. In order to qualify, the VA Police must purchase indoor/outdoor range hours from two ranges in the tri-state area.  

Requirements/Objective

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>N61331-20-CH-01<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />FOR<br />NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE &amp; BALLISTIC PERSONAL PROTECTION PROJECT</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.0 Description</strong></p>
<p>1.1 The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command Chemical Biological Defense and Ballistic Personal Protection (NAVSEA CBD &amp; BPP) Project is seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide an overgarment that provides percutaneous protection to the shipboard Sailor from Chemical/Biological (CB) warfare agents and other hazardous materials which may be employed against them to cause injuries. The overgarment shall allow Sailors to perform all necessary tasks without degrading performance or increasing the risk of heat related injuries. NSWC PCD is looking for information on mature fire retardant technology that can be used aboard ship with legacy Chem/Bio protective military masks, gloves and overboots.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Navy is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</span></strong> Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the NAVSEA CBD &amp; BPP project is to ensure that Navy forces have the capability to operate effectively and decisively in the face of CB and Ballistic threats in both warfighter and homeland security missions.</p>
<p>Our equipment is designed, developed, and delivered with the sole purpose of preserving human life. We are committed to providing a rapid and effective response to emerging Navy needs as new risks are identified within a dynamic threat environment - both CONUS and OCONUS. We are committed to providing the best product available and maintain an active role in the product improvement process. We continue to design, develop, and implement enhancements in capability, reductions in total ownership (life cycle) costs and integration of new technology where appropriate.</p>
<p>We ensure that a comprehensive logistics support infrastructure is established and maintained to provide long-term product quality and effectiveness. This includes the delivery, fielding, and training of new products and product improvements. It also includes the refurbishment and retrofit of existing products and evaluation of maintenance and repair procedures. Each activity contributes to our overall goal of promoting the highest level of operator safety.</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for our product line belongs to The Extreme Environment Life Support Branch, within the Maritime Mission Systems Division. Our engineering assignments include all non-aviation personal protection equipment for protection against chemical, biological, radiological threats or against ballistic threats. Our customers include all U.S. Navy afloat and ashore forces.</p>
<p>Protective ensembles are provided to U.S. Navy forward deployed and deploying forces. We ensure that fully serviceable gear is issued to ensure continued operations during increasing Mission Oriented Protective Posture levels and Anti-Terrorism Afloat operations. CBD protective equipment includes protective coats and trousers, boots, gloves, and masks.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Planned Production:</strong></p>
<p>The magnitude of need spans Navy deployers from all Warfare Enterprises and Enabler Commands. Therefore, the total U.S. Navy requirement could be between 250,000 and 600,000.</p>

The addition will tie into the 2nd, 3rd and 4th levels of the existing facility, and include raised access flooring, elevators and restrooms, a fire detection system, fire suppression systems, and mechanical systems that are independent but tied into the existing Nicholson building systems chiller and EMCS. A temporary SCIF boundary wall will be constructed on the connections to the existing facility to keep the existing SCIF accreditation prior to connections from the new addition. Electrical power for the addition will be provided with electrical power from an expansion of the existing building switchgear, and include redundant standby generators and a UPS system for the SCIF information technology center. The building will be designed to comply with TEMPEST standards and accommodate AT/FP requirements including design for progressive collapse. Rock excavation is included to make the addition possible using a cantilever design to reduce construction costs. Supporting facilities will include electric, water and gas distribution, sanitary and storm water drainage systems on and offsite. The parking structure will be built over existing on-grade parking to minimize the amount of additional parking that needs to be provided - 250 additional spaces will be provided on two levels. Facilities will be designed to a minimum life of 40 years in accordance with DoD's Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC 1-200-02) including energy efficiencies, building envelope and integrated building systems performance.</p>

<p><br />6.  Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Work includes, but is not limited to, providing indoor and outdoor spaces to maintain and monitor approximately 300 Fraxinus uhdei (Tropical Ash) trees and tree care for the same. Services are anticipated to begin immediately after award. Requirements are further as follows;</p>
<p>I. Objective<br />To contract for services to grow and maintain 300 Fraxinus uhdei (Tropical Ash) trees that will support a significant portion of the leaves needed to successfully operate the emerald ash borer (EAB) biocontrol rearing facility. The contractor must also repot the 300 trees utilizing existing pots and trim roots to allow for repotting. The contractor's space for growing and maintaining the trees must be located within approximately 20 miles from the USDA APHIS PPQ office, located at 5936 Ford Court, Suite 200, Brighton, MI 48116.<br />II. Background<br />EAB is a very small but very destructive beetle. Metallic green in color, its slender body measures 1/2 inch in length and 1/8 inch wide. The average adult beetle can easily fit on a penny. Native to China and eastern Asia, the EAB probably landed in North America hidden in wood packing materials commonly used to ship consumer goods, auto parts, and the like. Although no one can say for sure when EAB arrived in southeastern Michigan, the scientific community believes the beetle went undetected for over 10 years, based on its widespread distribution and destruction. EAB was officially identified in the summer of 2002.<br />This beetle has been found in 5 states and the District of Columbia (Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) and is responsible for the death or decline of tens of millions of ash trees and billions more are at risk. In addition, the Canadian government has also been engaged in an EAB program of its own.<br />In an effort to control the spread of damage caused by EAB, USDA&#8208;APHIS&#8208;PPQ turned to the release of biocontrol agents.<br />Four parasitic wasps are currently being released as biocontrol agents that target different life stages of EAB. These parasitioids are reared from EAB larvae at the mass rearing facility in Brighton, MI. Several EAB colonies are maintained in order to obtain sufficient numbers of EAB to support parasitoid rearing operations. The maintenance of these colonies requires several components, but perhaps none more important than high quality leaf material.<br />III. Scope of Work<br />A. Maintain highly productive F. uhdei trees with the intention of using leaves to rear Emerald Ash Borer Beetles (EAB) to support biocontrol efforts of the same.<br />&bull;	Provide appropriate night/day heated (74&#8208;82&#8304;F) indoor space (~3000 sq ft) for continual growth of 300 mature F. uhdei trees during winter months or when threatened with frost.<br />&bull;	Supply space during summer months that will provide adequate temperatures to avoid heat damage (outdoor area is sufficient).<br />&bull;	Monitor and report the health of plants, which will include insect damage and signs of stress that would occur from inappropriate watering, fertilizing, and lighting regimes.<br />&bull;	Modify work plans with cooperation from EAB rearing facility manager to address plant health issues.<br />&bull;	Maintain adequate staffing throughout the year to ensure delivery of labor to water and fertilize as needed and to monitor plant health. Plants will need to be root pruned and repotted with new soil and fertilizer approximately every 24 months.  Soil and fertilizer mixtures shall be directed by the rearing facility manager. <br />&bull;	Supply the resources necessary to maintain adequate temperature, watering, and fertilizing schedules to facilitate leaf production and hardening.<br />&bull;	When biocontrol applications/pest trapping are deemed necessary, a schedule of biocontrol releases/trapping and the appropriate biocontrol agents/traps will be supplied to the contractor by the Government. The contractor shall release the biocontrol agents and hang traps according to the supplied schedule and product directions. Certain situations may warrant the use of pesticides to be supplied by the contractor, but this decision will ultimately be made by the EAB biocontrol facility manager and would require a modification to the contract in accordance with clause 52.212&#8208;4.  Pesticides cannot be used.<br />&bull;	Maintenance log will be maintained and made available for review upon request. Maintenance log will include schedules for watering, fertilizing, and lighting as well as any situational modifications made.<br />B. Logistics<br />&bull;	Plants will be on the contractor's facility within 10 days following contract award.<br />Delivery will be made by the government and coordinated with the Contractor. The EAB rearing facility manager, team leaders, and maintenance engineer will have unrestricted access to area housing PPQ trees for emergency purposes.<br />&bull;	Personnel (facility manager, team leaders, and lab technicians) from the EAB rearing facility will travel to the selected greenhouse to select and harvest leaves used in the production facility during regular business hours, unless otherwise discussed.<br />C. Deliverables<br />&bull;	High quality, nutritious leaf material that supports beetle rearing operations.<br />&bull;	Emergency Contacts (names and phone numbers to be added at time of award)<br />D. Period of Performance<br />&bull;	The contractor shall be required to commence work under this contract within 10 calendar days after the date the Contractor receives the notice of award. Services are anticipated to begin November 1, 2019. This contract includes a 12&#8208;month base period and three 12&#8208;month option periods. The Government has the option to extend the term of this contract by exercising option periods in accordance with clause 52.217&#8208;9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.<br />Base Period:  Award Date through October 31, 2020.<br />Option 1:  November 1, 2020 through October 31, 2021.<br />Option 2:  November 1, 2021 through October 31, 2022.<br />Option 3:  November 1, 2022 through October 31, 2023.</p>

The Government may reject any or all quotes if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received.</span></p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Epidural Trays and Needles. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MD-1811-89_Epidural_Trays_And_Needles are eligible for participation. The MMESO DHA is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Epidural Trays and Needles products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MD-1811-89_Epidural_Trays_And_Needles. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 23 November 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MD-1811-89_Epidural_Trays_And_Needles, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Epidural Trays and Needles.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Epidural Trays and Needles. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $984,178 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MD-1811-89_Epidural_Trays_And_Needles who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO DHA that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO DHA via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1.

Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO DHA Data Analyst, Mr. Greg Hagood, 301-619-9589, william.hagood4.ctr@mail.mil, Contractor, MMESO DHA Team Leader, Ms. Shatema Mills, 301-619-6819, shatema.d.mills.ctr@mail.mil, Contractor, and DLA Troop Support Medical Contracting Officer: Ms. Tara J.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Specimen Containers. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO DHA is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Specimen Containers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil">https://www.medical.dla.mil</a>. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Specimen Containers in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Specimen Containers will be established approximately 10 March 2020 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately 10 April&nbsp;2020, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Specimen Containers. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Specimen Containers.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Specimen Containers. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $439,833. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Four items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($439,833) of the total volume in sales ($439,833). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin.

All requests for repair service will be considered requests for emergency service unless a statement to the contrary is made by the COR, POC or designee.  Such statements will be documented on the service report.

Failure to carry out the above procedures will be considered as a failure to document the service visit and will constitute a failure to perform.

Whenever contact with Biomedical Engineering is required outside of normal duty hours, the Utility System Repair Operator (USRO) may be contacted as an alternate.

 RESPONSE TO SERVICE REQUESTS:

The contractor must respond to requests for emergency service in the following manner:

A competent service representative adequately equipped with tools, test instruments and repair parts will arrive at the SAVAHCS within the designated response time.

The competent service representative will be prepared to begin work immediately to resolve the complaint as expressed by the COR, POC or designee when service was requested.  Work needed to resolve the complaint will continue without interruption until the problem is resolved.

The service representative will come equipped with all the service/technical manuals needed to perform the work.

The service representative may contact VA staff by phone before arrival at the SAVAHCS.  Such contacts, however, will not serve to alter the requirements for arrival on-site except when the request for service is withdrawn by Biomedical Engineering.

The designated response time for this contract is 24 hours from the time of the request for service.  If repeated requests are made before the arrival of contractor s repairer, the first request will determine the required time of arrival.

All requests for repair service will be considered requests for emergency service unless a statement to the contrary is made by the COR, POC or designee.  Such statements will be documented on the service report.

Preventive maintenance services must be scheduled within 2-3 weeks from the time of the request of service.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />The United States Agency for International Development ("USAID" or the "Agency") is seeking proposals to enable USAID's energy programs to respond to a broad range of Agency priorities, including post-disaster and post-conflict recovery, economic growth and poverty reduction, regional security, and environmental stewardship for the Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment ("E3") as described in the attached Request for Proposals ("RFP"). USAID anticipates awarding Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") Contracts (up to eight IDIQ contracts, of which up to three may be reserved for small business concerns).  USAID reserves the right to award more or less awards than this anticipated number or to make no award.</p>
<p>USAID invites all interested and responsible organizations to submit offers in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation. USAID will conduct this procurement as a full and open competition under which any type of organization may submit a proposal. The procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") Part 15 will govern the procurement. The North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS") Code is 541990. The Authorized Geographic Code for procurement of goods and services under any task order issued under this IDIQ Contract is 937.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum aggregate ordering limitation for contracts resulting from this RFP will not exceed $500,000,000 over the five (5)-year ordering period. This ceiling is not being subdivided among the number of awardees nor is it being multiplied by the number of awardees. There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractors will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order guarantee set forth in the RFP.</p>
<p>Upon award of the Energy IDIQ II contracts, USAID anticipates issuing one initial Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee ("CPFF") Term task order.

Failure to comply with the submission date will deem any submission unacceptable and it will not be reviewed or evaluated.  Faxed proposals are not acceptable, nor will they be reviewed or evaluated.</p>
<p>The issuance of this RFP in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. Award of a contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals.</p>
<p>This RFP can be viewed and downloaded from www.fedbizopps.gov.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.

L. 114-328).&nbsp; Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services, based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject-matter expert peers within the Air Force.&nbsp; Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items.<br /><br /><em>***This offering is open to all NAICS***</em></p>
<p>The Air Force intends to obtain "innovative" solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfill requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements.&nbsp; Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are currently not used by units at USAFE-AFARICA that would enhance or streamline mission capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Innovative" is defined as any technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It also includes any new application of an existing technology, process, or method.</p>
<p>This CSO contains broadly defined Areas of Interest (AOI) and attention to more specific requirements. While these AOI's are geared toward meeting USAFE-AFARICA requirements, the Air Force reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements outside of USAFE-AFARICA with similar AOI and mission requirements.</p>
<p>USAFE-AFAFRICA will utilize an open, two-step CSO evaluation process.&nbsp; In step 1, offerors must submit a white paper (technical data) and a pitch deck (PowerPoint Presentation) for evaluation.&nbsp; There is no limit on the number of offers submitted per offeror, neither per AOI nor in total. Once the evaluations are complete, all offerors will be notified as to whether they will be invited to pitch their proposal at a Pitch Day event (step 2).&nbsp; USAFE-AFAFRICA also reserves the right to skip step 2 and make an award after step 1.</p>
<p>Offerors that are selected will receive an invitation to make a virtual pitch to the USAFE/AFAFRICA team during a Pitch Day event, which will be held on 13 November 2019. Please note that travel is not required to participate in the Pitch Day, as the proposals will be presented virtually. Offerors will pitch their solution to evaluators and will be immediately notified if they were selected for an award.</p>
<p>In order to expedite funds, the Government intends to pay a percentage of any awarded contracts with the Government Purchase Card (GPC); this will require you to have the ability to accept a credit card payment at this event for payment.</p>
<p>Further information on Pitch Day will be made available as the event date gets closer. Any questions or concerns can be addressed via e-mail to Mr. Sean Kennedy at <a href="mailto:sean.kennedy@us.af.mil">sean.kennedy@us.af.mil</a>, Mr. Nathaniel Searing at <a href="mailto:nathaniel.searing@us.af.mil">nathaniel.searing@us.af.mil</a>, Mr. John Masters at <a href="mailto:johnathon.masters.1@us.af.mil">johnathon.masters.1@us.af.mil</a> and Maj Jeff Fry at <a href="mailto:jeffrey.fry@us.af.mil">jeffrey.fry@us.af.mil</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals<br /></strong>The following section outlines the proposal requirements.&nbsp; It also includes timelines for submissions and information about the Pitch Day.</p>
<p>All contracts will be firm-fixed price.&nbsp; All supplies or services procured via this CSO are treated as commercial items.&nbsp; The Air Force must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award.&nbsp; The Air Force intends to award FAR Part 12 contracts as a result of this CSO, but reserves the right to award agreements, if deemed in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<p>USAFE-AFAFRICA recommends that you complete your submission early, as computer traffic gets heavy near the announcement closing and could slow down the system.&nbsp; Do not wait until the last minute.

<p>Offerors may submit proposal amendments any time prior to the proposal deadline (7 October 2019) specified on the FBO website, however the Air Force will ONLY review the final amended proposal that is submitted.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your e-mail address listed in your proposal is current and accurate.&nbsp; USAFE-AFAFRICA is not responsible for ensuring notifications are received by firms changing mailing address/e-mail address/company points of contact after proposal submission without proper notification to USAFE-AFAFRICA.&nbsp; Changes of this nature shall be annotated in the FBO submittal or amendments.</p>

<p>Further information on Pitch Day will be made available as the event date gets closer.</p>
<p><strong>Procedures and Criteria for Selecting Proposals<br /></strong>USAFE-AFAFRICA will utilize a two-step evaluation process.&nbsp; In step 1, offerors submit a cover letter, white paper and a pitch deck.&nbsp; In step 2, offerors will make a live pitch to the USAFE-AFAFRICA Team.</p>
<p>After receipt of step 1 proposals, the Air Force will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.</p>
<ul>
<li>The technical factor will assess how innovative the solution is (as defined in this announcement) and the feasibility of the solution solving the unit's challenges. </li>
<li>The importance to agency programs factor will assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit. </li>
</ul>
<p>The funds availability factor will assess the availability of funding to purchase the solution at Pitch Day.</p>
<p>Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable.&nbsp; The Air Force must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209.&nbsp; The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable.&nbsp; In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request information from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the Air Force and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, the Air Force will select offerors to participate in step 2, a Pitch Day.&nbsp; All offerors will be notified as to whether they will be invited to pitch their proposal at a Pitch Day event.</p>
<p>Offerors that are selected for step 2 will receive an invitation to make a live pitch to the USAFE-AFAFRICA team during a Pitch Day event to be held 13 November 2019 at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Offerors will pitch their solution to evaluators and to the greatest extent practicable will be immediately notified if they were selected for an award.&nbsp; The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1: technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.</p>
<p>During any step of the CSO, the Air Force may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation.&nbsp; The Air Force reserves the right to award to an offeror prior to step 2, Pitch Day event.</p>
<p>The Government may elect to use external market research in the evaluation of the proposal.</p>

<DESC>This is an Unrestricted Solicitation. As a result for this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, the Coast Guard is seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for Teardown, Test, and Evaluation fee, No Fault Found fee, Beyond Economical or Return "As Is" fee, and the commercial aircraft component repair/overhaul services price prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. Solicitation number 70Z03820QL0000002 is issued as a Special Notice of Intent to Award to the Component OEM. It is anticipated that a non-competitive Sole Source Purchase Order shall be awarded as a result of this notice. It is the Governments belief, that only the Component OEM or a previously established Capable Repair Vendor in possession of the required OEM Data has the required proprietary technical and engineering data to successfully provide these repair services. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within (3) calendar days from this notice posting. The information submitted must include a letter from the OEM verifying the Offeror is an authorized service distributor and verifying the OEM will supply only genuine OEM parts. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2019-06.
<p>Any vendor, except the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Production Approval Holder (PAH), repairing Coast Guard Aircraft Components MUST be FAA 145 certified and perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work at their company's FAA certified facility. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the repair or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists. Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their service data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS Engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Charles.J.Rice@uscg.mil for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 488190. The Coast Guard intends to issue a Not-To-Exceed post assessment firm fixed price repair/overhaul order to the Aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the Component Production Approval Holder (PAH), or a PAH Authorized and Capable Service Facility, for repair/overhaul using OEM Proprietary Data for the following item(s):<br /><br />12&nbsp;Each NSN 1680-99-767-8851, P/N 677001005, ACTUATOR-BALLSCREW <br />(Repair is to be IAW CMM 27-50-28 Latest Revision)</p>
<p>Solicitation Information Packet is attached to this solicitation. The Coast Guard does not own nor can provide the OEM's Service Manuals, Service Bulletins, or Proprietary Data. Unless the OEM, with their quote, vendors must provide a copy of the first page of the current OEM Manual or Service Reference, and in their quote make reference to it (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789"). The Aircraft OEM is AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE SAU EADS CASA DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic facility is AIRBUS DS MILITARY AIRCRAFT, INC Cage Code is 0DAF1. Determined by the escalated urgency of need, the closing date for this solicitation is OCT 9, 2019 at 9:00 am EDT. Anticipated award date is on or about OCT 10, 2019, with an anticipated required completion on or before DEC 20, 2019. Point of contact for this intent to award notice is Mr. Terry Blucker PA/KO, email Terence.L.Blucker@uscg.mil.</p>

<p><br />The United States Agency for International Development ("USAID" or the "Agency") is seeking proposals to enable USAID's energy programs to respond to a broad range of Agency priorities, including post-disaster and post-conflict recovery, economic growth and poverty reduction, regional security, and environmental stewardship for the Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment ("E3") as described in the attached Request for Proposals ("RFP"). USAID anticipates awarding Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") Contracts (up to eight IDIQ contracts, of which up to three may be reserved for small business concerns).  USAID reserves the right to award more or less awards than this anticipated number or to make no award.</p>
<p>USAID invites all interested and responsible organizations to submit offers in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation. USAID will conduct this procurement as a full and open competition under which any type of organization may submit a proposal. The procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") Part 15 will govern the procurement. The North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS") Code is 541990. The Authorized Geographic Code for procurement of goods and services under any task order issued under this IDIQ Contract is 935.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum aggregate ordering limitation for contracts resulting from this RFP will not exceed $500,000,000 over the five (5)-year ordering period. This ceiling is not being subdivided among the number of awardees nor is it being multiplied by the number of awardees. There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractors will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order guarantee set forth in the RFP.</p>
<p>Upon award of the Energy IDIQ II contracts, USAID anticipates issuing one initial Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee ("CPFF") Term task order. The period of performance for this task order is five years, and the total estimated cost ("TEC') for this task order is between $20,000,000 and $23,000,000. Prospective offerors must submit questions about this solicitation to Matthew Courtad (mcourtad@usaid.gov), Selam Demissie (sdemissie@usaid.gov), and Tseyone Demissie (tsdemissie@usaid.gov) by the time and date indicated above.

Offerors should take into account the expected delivery time required by the proposal transmission method they choose, and they are responsible for ensuring proposals are received at USAID by the due date and time as specified in Section L.  Failure to comply with the submission date will deem any submission unacceptable and it will not be reviewed or evaluated.  Faxed proposals are not acceptable, nor will they be reviewed or evaluated.</p>
<p>The issuance of this RFP in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. Award of a contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals.</p>
<p>This RFP can be viewed and downloaded from www.fedbizopps.gov.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.

<div>UPDATE: 5 September 2019<br />Request For Information #2<br />Industry Day #2
<p>Attachments:<br />Question Comment Matrix<br />Requirement Document</p>
1.	NOTICE: This is not a solicitation, but rather a Request for Information (RFI) to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.
<p>1.1	The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research and obtain industry input on the current requirement (see attached draft Requirement Document). The government is interested in gathering information about technical capabilities and solutions available in the market place to determine whether responsible sources exist and to assist in determining the best acquisition strategy for this requirement.</p>
<p>1.2	The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 336111, which has a corresponding size standard of 1500 employees.</p>
<p><br />2	Program Details:</p>
<p>2.1	The Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) has a requirement to provide high and slow speed moving vehicles to various range customers. The current vehicles used to provide this capability are reaching their life limit for sustainability and are expected to become obsolete by Fiscal Year 2021.</p>
<p>2.2	The government intends to conduct this acquisition under Other Transaction Authority (OTA) in accordance with (IAW) 10 U.S.C. 2371b for prototypes and 10 U.S.C. 2371b(f) for production.</p>
<p>2.2.1	In order to participate in an Other Transaction (OT), the contractor must be a nontraditional defense contractor (see definition below in 2.2.2). Teaming arrangements are allowed, but a nontraditional contractor must participate to a significant extent (See 10 U.S.C. 2371b(d)).</p>
<p>2.2.2	Nontraditional Defense Contactor - An entity that is not currently performing and has not performed, for at least the one-year period preceding the solicitation of sources by the Department of Defense for the procurement or transaction, any contract or subcontract for the Department of Defense that is subject to full coverage under the cost accounting standards prescribed pursuant to section 1502 of title 41 and the regulations implementing such section. (10 U.S.C. 2302(9)).</p>
<p>2.3	An Industry Day will be hosted by the UTTR on 1-2 October 2019.  This will allow vendors to participate in briefings and one-on-one sessions (day 1) and become familiar with range infrastructure and topography (tour day 2). To facilitate meaningful discussion at the industry day, companies should ask for clarification of requirements if necessary, provide feedback leading up to the industry day, and have hardware/software engineers in attendance at the industry day. Companies are allowed to bring product information to the industry day. NOTE: Proprietary information should be marked as such.</p>
<p>2.4	Following the industry day, the government intends to issue a request for White Papers, which will be used to down-select to a group of contractors from which the government intends to directly solicit proposals.</p>
<p>2.5	The Government anticipates that selected companies will be issued prototype OTs and funded a set amount to automate a government-furnished vehicle (HMMWV) and participate in a product capability demonstration event at the Utah Test and Training Range in 1st/2nd QTR 2020 (date TBD).</p>
<p>2.6	The Government intends to evaluate the products IAW thresholds and objectives outlined in the Requirement Document, then potentially issue a follow-on production OT to the company that can provide a product that meets/exceeds the requirements of the Requirement Document at the best value to the Government.</p>
<p><br />3	Industry Response:</p>
<p>3.1	Provide responses to the attached question &amp; comment matrix.</p>
<p>3.2	Review the attached Requirement Document and provide feedback.</p>
<p>3.3	RSVP for the industry day NLT 20 September 2019.  If attendees do not have base access, please submit names, driver's license numbers, and state issued of those attending as part of your RSVP.</p>
<p>3.4	Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract or agreement. The government is not obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this notice. Responses to this notice will not be returned. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in future solicitation, if one is issued. However, the Government encourages and values any input provided by industry to improve this acquisition.</p>
<p>3.5	Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00pm MST on Friday, 20 September 2019.</p>
<p><br />4	Points of Contact:</p>

It is expected to be needing these services beginning the late October – November 2019 timeframe with anticipated completion of all five (5) sites is late spring or early summer 2020.

1.	A single engine aircraft would be acceptable as long as it is able to transport the projected weight loads. 
2.	The government is not concerned with the category of the aircraft, as long as the aircraft is able to effectively transport our crew and materials in a safe and efficient manner. 
3.	The Government prefers that all hook-up, rigging, straps, cargo net, etc., be provided by the contractor.
4.	Passenger pick-up and drop-off locations will vary depending on the site we are working at the time beings the 5 sites are not all in the same area.
5.	Maximum payloads are still in planning but don’t expected to be as much as $5,000lbs.
6.	Any costs associated with this effort are to be captured in the daily rate proposed for the estimated number of days such as mobilization and demobilization.  Final payment will be based on the actual number of flight days the project takes by aircraft type and each day the aircraft is held on standby. The estimated number of days is only an estimate and may be more or less, therefore we would like the contract to reflect a daily rate with an unknown number of lifts per day.

**NON-MANUFACTURING RULE (NMR)**

The requirement that a Non-Manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R. § 121.406].  In order to qualify as a small business concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R. § 125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States.

ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as set-aside for SDVOSB.  The applicable NAICS code is 334510.   The solicitation will be issued on or about October 7, 2019 for approximately ten (10) business days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety.  In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at james.carson2@va.gov AND sandra.johnson3@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.
