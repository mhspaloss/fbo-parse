<DESC>LADAR Innovative Development and Research (LIDR)
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE/NEEDS: The objective of this effort is to conduct innovative research and development (R&amp;D) of electro-optical components and technology, furthering advanced warfighting capabilities and supporting the existing and emerging needs of the Air Force and DoD. It is expected that these will be accomplished through laboratory experimentation, component fabrication and analysis, system integration, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), field and flight testing, signal analysis, target fabrication, and evaluation. The primary goal of this effort is to develop advanced sensor technologies and techniques successfully operable in contested and denied environments meeting Air Force air superiority, global precision attack, rapid global mobility, special operations, and global integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) service core function needs.</p>
<p>LADAR Innovative Development and Research (LIDR) will continue to advance state-of-the-art active and associated passive electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) technologies, seek synergies with active and passive radio frequency (RF) technologies, and define and test the integrability of these technologies in support of the Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter. The primary focus of current Air Force needs is enhanced combat identification and high resolution wide area three-dimensional imaging (WATI). This research is organized across four primary technology areas: Synthetic Aperture Laser Radar (LADAR), Vibration Sensing, Direct Detection 3 Dimensional (3D) LADAR, and multiple modalities in a single LADAR sensor.</p>
<p>Asynchronous Geiger Mode LADAR Receiver Development (A-GMLRD)</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE/NEEDS: The objective of this effort is to develop asynchronous Geiger mode LiDAR receivers and Geiger mode laser communications (lasercom) receivers for military use, supporting AF research efforts. The Asynchronous Geiger Mode LADAR Receiver Development (A-GMLRD) project will develop a packaged light detection and ranging (LiDAR) receiver system for laser detection and ranging (LADAR) imaging systems and lasercom applications. The result will yield a photon sensitive receiver capable of providing high precision timing measurements to objects within the sensor field of view (FOV), supporting AF sensor development programs and lasercom programs.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a small business size standard of $41.5M in average annual revenue.
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract for the purchase of Intel Serial Lite III IP Core in Source Code format with:</p>
<p>Intel Corporation<br />2200 Mission College Boulevard<br />Santa Clara, CA 95054</p>
<p>This requirement is for the purchase of Intel Serial Lite III IP Core in Source Code format - High speed serial interface supporting Intel proprietary data interchange format required for the design and fabrication of computer chips to be compatible with existing communication modules. AFRL is designing a computer chip that must interface with an existing module that uses Intel's proprietary Serial Lite 3 interface. Since Serial Lite 3 is proprietary, it can only be purchased from Intel. To adopt and incorporate an alternative would cost millions of dollars in equipment, training, and research program conversion efforts.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to richard.childres@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 NOV 2019.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY. 
 
The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), intends to competitively award a contract for the Development of a Tool to Recover Oil under Solid Ice. This pre-solicitation notice is being issued in accordance with FAR Part 5.204.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. This is not a small business set-aside.  The BSEE Procurement Operations Branch is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administrator.  The Government anticipates awarding a hybrid type contract with Firm Fixed Price, reimbursable travel, and time and materials CLINS.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541715  Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology).  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be 24 months from the date of award.  All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) before their proposal is submitted.  
BACKGROUND: 

Alaska Clean Seas (ACS), a primary oil spill removal organization in Alaska, identified the need for a tool to recover oil under solid ice. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) initiated project 1082 with the Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) and ACS to address this and other identified response needs.
https://www.bsee.gov/research-record/osrr-1082-methods-to-enhance-mechanical-recovery-in-arctic-conditions
In February 2018, CRREL successfully demonstrated a method to move pockets of oil trapped under ice using a Seabotix ROV equipped with an air delivery system. This test was conducted at CRRELs outdoor saltwater tank in which was grown a solid ice sheet of approximately 8-10 inches thick. Several pockets were developed on the underside of the ice, and crude oil was injected under the ice into these pockets. The ROV was sent under the ice to view the oil and to move the oil out from the pockets to channels cut in the ice for topside recovery. The prototype was successful at moving the crude oil out of pockets formed in the underside of the ice. However, the dislodged oil was difficult to direct to the channels using the air delivery system.  
At the end of the demonstration, inspection of the ice revealed that within a short period of time oil began to crystalize into the underside of the ice sheet and move up through the brine channels formed within the ice. These newly formed crystals were able to be easily scraped off of the ice. This proposed project builds off of the lessons learned from the previous demonstration.

SCOPE OF WORK:

This goals and objectives of this project are to design, fabricate, and test a System consisting of a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) equipped with a mounted tooling skid, to be used to detect, inspect, and recover pockets of oil under solid ice, and to scrape and remove oil-laden ice crystals formed on the underside of the ice.

The selected ROV shall be a commercially available vehicle. The tooling skid shall consist of a pumping system, an integrated oil collection nozzle and scraping tool, navigation, and lighting to allow differentiation of oil, water, and ice. The tooling skid shall be designed to have a standardized plug and play power and data protocol such that it can be used with any qualified ROV. 

This project shall use a phased approach to mitigate risk. In Phase I, the contractor shall complete an in depth analysis of commercially available ROVs, and select an ROV vehicle that can be equipped with a tooling skid to meet performance objectives. Preliminary research indicates that an Observation Class ROV with payload capabilities will be the targeted vehicle for this System.  The contractor shall also complete the tooling skid design for the selected ROV. Upon BSEEs approval to move forward, the contractor shall conduct Phase II work.

In Phase II, the contractor shall purchase the selected ROV after approval by BSEE. The contractor shall procure components and fabricate the tooling skid. integrate the tooling skid and ROV, conduct testing of the final System, and deliver the completed System to Ohmsett. 

HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) which includes the statement of work, proposal submission instructions, and evaluation factors will be issued via FBO.gov as Solicitation No. 140E0120R0001 within the next month.  If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, you must follow the proposal submission instructions included in the RFP. If you are interested in participating, please send your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone number, email address, DUNS number, and business size via email to the David Jablonski at David.Jablonski@bsee.gov.

<SUBJECT>Hemorrhage Detection Technology
<SOLNBR>MTEC-20-01-Hemorrhage
<RESPDATE>112719
<CONTACT>Rebecca Harmon, Email rebecca.harmon@ati.org
<DESC><div>This is a pre-announcement only. No response is required at this time.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this pre-announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) focused on the development of a noninvasive technology for early diagnosis and provider alert of decompensation due to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock in order to inform earlier lifesaving interventions and improve patient outcomes.</div>
<p>Problem Statement<br />Hemorrhage is the leading cause of trauma-related death in both civilian and military populations. More than 33% of prehospital deaths and 50% of deaths occurring within 24 hours of traumatic injury are from hemorrhage. Approximately 50% of combat-related preventable deaths that take place before reaching a military treatment facility (MTF) are hemorrhage related. A study of 4,596 battlefield fatalities from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom determined that hemorrhage accounted for 91% of potentially survivable fatalities occurring prior to arrival at an MTF . This supports the vital need for early detection and intervention.</p>
<p>Technology Focus Area<br />This program is intended to support the development or implementation of technological solutions that can provide early diagnosis information and alert of decompensation due to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock in order to inform earlier lifesaving interventions and improve patient outcomes. Offerors should only propose potential devices and technology solutions that meet the following three criteria:<br />1.	Currently be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 or above [definition of TRL - https://mtec-sc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/TRL-definitions.pdf] <br />2.	Currently be in development or commercially available; and<br />3.	Must be capable of meeting the criteria for use in forward deployed environments and patient transport.</p>
<p>Solution Requirements:<br />An ideal solution would meet the following requirements (not listed in order of importance): <br />&bull;	Have the ability to non-invasively monitor and alert the provider:<br />o	when a patient is decompensating and at risk of impending hemorrhagic shock earlier than indicated by traditional vital signs or clinical practice, or <br />o	that a patient is experiencing significant hemorrhage that, if untreated, will inevitably lead to hemorrhagic shock <br />&bull;	Be easily usable by combat medics and or physicians assistants at a Battalion Aid Station (or equivalent Service providers at Role 1) and during patient transport <br />&bull;	Achieve FDA clearance/approval for use in trauma patients aged 18-65 <br />&bull;	Provide data analysis and definitive output in real time or near real-time <br />&bull;	Integrated into or replace an existing patient monitoring device; or be a small portable device (4 ounces, 4 cubic inches) <br />&bull;	Requires no specialized personnel, maintenance requirements, or tools to operate or maintain the system <br />&bull;	Be compatible with military operational environments (e.g., low visibility, extreme temperature variation, blackout conditions) <br />&bull;	Be capable of passing airworthiness, safe-to-fly testing which includes electrical-magnetic interference testing, vibration testing, and crash testing <br />&bull;	Be capable of meeting environmental testing parameters as stated in MIL STD 810G <br />&bull;	Be capable of meeting Risk Management Framework requirements, as applicable (NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework) to gain authority to operate on military networks</p>
<p>Government Furnished Information (GFI):<br />Two Government laboratories have previously developed algorithms to detect decompensation due to hemorrhage using standard vital sign monitors:<br />&bull;	The Automated Processing of the Physiologic Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity (APPRAISE) algorithm from the Biotechnology High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute (BHSAI)<br />&bull;	The Compensatory Reserve Measurement (CRM) algorithm from U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) <br />Since Government laboratories are not eligible to serve as the prime contractor of white papers in response to MTEC funding opportunities, we encourage potential Offerors to partner with these laboratories as appropriate. The Sponsor neither endorses one algorithm as preferable over the other, nor over any algorithms developed by industry or academia. More information will be provided in the RPP.</p>
<p>*NOTE: There is ample information publicly available regarding the APPRAISE and CRM algorithms.  If you include one of these algorithms as part of your technical approach and you are invited for Full Proposal submission, then you will be provided with a point of contact at the respective Government laboratory to work with on your full proposal. Contact information for the Government laboratory partners will not be provided by MTEC at this time.</p>
<p>Project Scope and Potential for Follow-on Work:<br />The initial 12 month delivery schedule should be focused on tasks relevant to prototype development through proof of concept in a clinical study or system prototype demonstration in a relevant or operational environment for detection of decompensation due to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock. Allowable costs include subject matter expertise, consultation to develop a regulatory strategy, testing and evaluation, and clinical trial support. Potential follow-on work in subsequent years may be awarded to continue product development toward additional human clinical trial(s) and relevant FDA clearance/approval.</p>
<p>Potential Funding Availability<br />The U.S. Government (USG) currently has available approximately $2 million (M) Defense Health Program (DHP) Research, Development, and Engineering (RD&amp;E) dollars for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.   An additional $2.75M of FY20 DHP funding may be available for potential follow-on work for the continuation of the development.  Pending successful completion of the total effort, the Government may issue a non-competitive follow-on production contract or transaction pursuant to 10 USC 2371b section f.<br />MTEC anticipates that one or more awards will be made to qualified teams composed of teaming arrangements demonstrated to develop a hemorrhage detection technology prototype through demonstration in a relevant or operational environment.<br />The initial Period of Performance (POP) is not to exceed 1 year.</p>
<p>Acquisition Approach<br />This RPP will be conducted using a two-staged approach. In Stage 1, current MTEC members are invited to submit White Papers using the format contained in the RPP. The Government will evaluate White Papers submitted and will select White Papers that best meet their current technology priorities using the criteria specified in the RPP. Offerors whose technology solution is selected for further consideration based on White Paper evaluation will be invited to submit a proposal in Stage 2. Notification letters will contain specific Stage 2 proposal submission requirements.</p>
<p>The RPP will be posted to the MTEC website (mtec-sc.org) and FedBizOpps (fbo.gov) to notify interested parties. MTEC membership is required for the submission of a white paper in response to this upcoming MTEC RPP. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec-sc.org/how-to-join/</p>
<p>MTEC<br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and supporting effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, nontraditional defense contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.</p>
<p>MTEC Member Teaming<br />While teaming is not required for this effort, Offerors are encouraged to consider teaming during the white paper preparation period (prior to submission of your white paper) if you cannot address the full scope of technical requirements of the RPP or otherwise believe a team may be beneficial to the Government Sponsor.</p>
<p>MTEC members are encouraged to use the MTEC Database Collaboration Tool to help identify potential teaming partners among other MTEC members. The Database Collaboration Tool provides a quick and easy way to search the membership for specific technology capabilities, collaboration interest, core business areas/focus, R&amp;D highlights/projects, and technical expertise. Contact information for each organization is provided as part of the member profile in the collaboration database tool to foster follow-up conversations between members as needed.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Database Tool can be accessed via the "MTEC Profiles Site" tab on the MTEC members-only website.</p>

<CONTACT>Heriberto (Eddie) Colon, Jr., Senior Contract Specialist, Email heriberto.colon@nrc.gov - Joseph L. Widdup, Branch Chief and Contracting Officer, Email joseph.widdup@nrc.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is not a request for proposals; therefore, responses to this notice will not be considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Federal Government to form a contract. Parties that respond to this RFI are advised that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the submitting party's expense. <br /><br />PURPOSE
<p>The NRC seeks information to determine the commercial availability and technical capabilities of qualified and responsible sources that are currently capable of providing solutions for the potential requirements described in this RFI. The information that NRC gathers from this RFI and related market research is for planning purposes only and may be used to assist the NRC in planning an acquisition strategy if a new acquisition is deemed appropriate by NRC.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NRC is conducting market research to identify potentially available commercial solutions that it may procure in the future to replace a customized License Fee Billing (LFB) module of the agency's core financial system with an up-to-date automated fee billing solution that includes at minimum the following functionality, but not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform timely fee calculations to meet requirements for the NRC to bill licensees under 10 CFR Part 170 (Part 170)* and 10 CFR Part 171 (Part 171)** by using real-time fee billing data uploads with the following current NRC interface systems to the agency's core financial system:<br />o Cost Activity Code System (CACS) -An on-premise, internally hosted customized web-based solution that maintains NRC employee task assignments, cost activity code (CAC) attributes, enterprise project IDs (EPID)s and labor cost strings. These data elements are used in the Human Resource Management System (HRMS).<br />o Enterprise Data Management System (EDMS) - An on-premise, internally hosted commercial off-the shelf data management solution that maintains Part 170/171 information for Power Reactor, Non-Power Reactor, New Reactor licensees, Facilities &amp; Materials and Storage &amp; Transportation licensee information.<br />o HRMS - An internally hosted Oracle PeopleSoft solution that maintains NRC employee time &amp; labor (T&amp;L) data. HRMS is provided with the accepted labor cost strings and data elements from CACS and EDMS. The T&amp;L data in HRMS is used to calculate Part 170 fees. <br />o Web Based Licensing system (WBL) - An external hosted customized web-based solution in FedRAMP Azure cloud environment that maintains Facilities &amp; Materials and Storage &amp; Transportation license modification requirements, sealed source and device (SS&amp;D) license data and information for general licenses, which are interfaced to EDMS <br />&bull; Automatically process and accumulate costs for contractor payment incurred for services provided to identifiable licensees and applicants. <br />&bull; Automatically process adjustments for time charged to fee billing activities that are submitted from HRMS.<br />&bull; Provide the ability to track all NRC validation responses to ensure that the Part 170 fee billing data is accurate prior to invoice generation.<br />&bull; Generate all fee billing reports, typically in MS Excel, MS Word and/or pdf format. <br />&bull; Generate printed invoices for mailing.<br />&bull; Automatically send electronic invoice data to eBilling. <br />o eBilling is an externally hosted FedRAMP Platform as a Solution (PaaS) public facing web-based application for use by the NRC's Licensees to retrieve their invoices online.<br />&bull; Automatically calculate and apply discount annual fee rates for qualified licensees.<br />&bull; Automatically calculate and apply prorated annual fee amounts for new and terminated licenses.<br />&bull; Automatically process all collection transactions from the NRC's designated collection institute.<br />&bull; Automate the account receivable transactions into the General Ledger module of the Financial Accounting and Integrated Management Information System (FAIMIS).<br />o FAIMIS is the agency's core financial system. <br />o FAIMIS is the official repository for agency's financial records and is used to produce official agency financial reports.<br />o FAIMIS is based upon CGI Momentum&reg; Enterprise Resource Planning commercial off-the shelf suite.<br />o FAIMIS is hosted on a FedRAMP Microsoft Azure Government Cloud.</p>
<p>*10 CFR PART 170 Fees for Services (Part 170)<br />10 CFR Part 170, "FEES FOR FACILITIES, MATERIALS, IMPORT AND EXPORT<br />LICENSES AND OTHER REGULATORY SERVICES UNDER THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954, as amended," is the NRC regulation that implements the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA). The fees under PART 170 are assessed for both the Reactor and Materials Programs. Part 170 fees may be charged as either 1) Full Cost Fees or 2) Flat Application Fees.</p>
<p>Full cost fees are determined by the professional staff time spent to identifiable licensees or applicants including contractual support services. The full cost fees for professional staff time is computed based on the actual hours spent and the established professional hourly rate at the time the service was provided (note that hourly rate changes each year based on the published Fee Rule). The flat application fees are charges provided in the Part 170 Fee Rule for new licenses. This fee is to cover the review and inspection time required by the NRC to determine if a new license will be issued. Part 170 invoices are generated on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>**10 CFR 171 Annual Fees (Part 171)<br />10 CFR Part 171 "ANNUAL FEES FOR REACTOR LICENSES, AND FUEL CYCLE<br />LICENSES AND MATERIALS LICENSES, INCLUDING HOLDERS OF CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE, REGISTRATIONS, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM APPROVALS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES LICENSED BY THE NRC" is the fee regulation that implements the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90), as amended. The annual fees assessed to NRC licensees under 10 CFR Part 171 recover the remainder of the budgeted costs subject to fee recovery that are not assessed under 10 CFR Part 170. The annual fees are established in two sections of 10 CFR 171 of the NRC's regulations. They are 10 CFR 171.15 for reactor licenses and 10 CFR 171.16 for material licenses. Part 171 annual fees less than $100K are generated for licensees on the anniversary month of the original license issue date or the license renewal date. Part 171 annual fees that are greater than $100K are generated on a quarterly basis. The NRC reevaluates its annual fees every year in accordance with annual fee calculation methodology.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING A RESPONSE TO THIS RFI<br /><br />To submit a response to this RFI, please do so by e-mail to Heriberto Colon, heriberto.colon@nrc.gov, with a courtesy copy to Joseph Widdup, joseph.widdup@nrc.gov by the response date and time specified in this notice.

<DESC>N00164-20-R-GP66 - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/SOURCES SOUGHT - TR-333 HYDROPHONE CERAMIC ELEMENTS - FSC 5845 - NAICS 334419
<p>Issue Date: 16 AUG 2019 - Closing Date: 06 SEPT 2019 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for TR-333 Hydrophone Ceramic Elements.  These highly specialized elements are a piezoelectric part used in the production of TR-333 Hydrophones, a component of the SP24 TRIDENT Navigation Subsystem Sonar.  See attached drawings 6745870-J and 6029165-J to review the technical requirements provided as Attachment 1 to this document. Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and registered in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive access to the drawings. Information about the JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp.</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to the current certified source, EDO Western Corporation, 2645 S. 300 W. Salt Lake City, UT 84115, (CAGE 24338).  This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition to the Hydrophone Ceramic Elements is to avoid roughly $3.8 million in cost duplication and prevent as much as three years unnecessary schedule impact. The program requires critical component suppliers to go through an extensive qualification plan, to include inspection, certification, first article testing, and operational testing. The Government has expended considerable effort and expense to develop the current certified source. The estimated cost to restore capability if a different vendor's Hydrophone Ceramic Element is procured is projected to be roughly $3.8 million higher than the proposed cost to utilize an existing certified source.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above.  Companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide components that meet the Government's requirement and certification requirements for TR-333 Hydrophone Ceramic Elements may respond.  Responses shall address how the Government can offset the estimated $3.8 million in cost duplication and the schedule delay that are anticipated to result if a new source is utilized.</p>
<p>Responses shall include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution.</p>

Upgrades - The Contractor shall provide upgrades to both the equipment hardware and software in order to maintain the integrity of the system and the state of the art technology at no additional charge to the Government. These shall be provided as they become commercially available and at the same time as they are being provided to commercial customers. This requirement only applies to  system upgrades  that enhance the model of equipment being offered, i.e. new version of software, correction of hardware defect, upgrade offered to commercial customers at no additional charge, upgrade to replace model of equipment no longer Contractor supported, etc. This does not refer to replacing the original piece of equipment provided under the contract; however, it does refer to significant changes in the hardware operational capability. 
Ancillary support equipment - The Contractor shall provide, install and maintain through the life of the contract, as indicated, any and all ancillary support equipment to fully operate the analyzer as defined in these specifications, e.g. cabinetry to support/house the analyzer (if necessary), water systems (including consumable polishers, filters, etc.), and universal interface equipment, etc. In addition, the Contractor shall include all ancillary components that are customarily sold or provided with the model of equipment proposed, e.g. starter kits, tables/stands, etc. 
Interface requirements   
Contractor will provide all hardware required for the connection, implementation, and operation of the interface to the universal interface and any incremental fee that is required each time an analyzer is added to the existing universal interface system. 
Contractor will provide any, and all necessary software support for insuring successful interfacing is established. Specific requirements for the communication of the data stream will be unique to the analyzers  system involved and dictated by the manufacturer itself. The Contractor will supply the information necessary to make the determination for type and amount of interfacing analyzers to be supplied.
When the Government site has a universal box, the Contractor will be responsible for everything leading up to the box including any incremental fees required to add additional analyzers (ie. licenses, port/cards, cable, software, etc.) to the universal interfacing system. 
When the Government site does not have a universal interface, and one is needed to optimally interface the analyzer, the Contractor will be responsible for the acquisition of the universal interface box and everything else needed to connect to the VA computerized hospital information system. 
If there are any software upgrades in the instrument during its life, the Contractor is responsible for ensuring the interface can accommodate any changes in the data stream going to the VA computerized hospital information system. 
Interface capability for back-up analyzer. 
Commercial Offerings   The Contractor shall provide any additional support material that is routinely provided to equivalent commercial customers and assists in regulatory compliance, e.g. Computer disc containing their procedure manual in CLSI format or an on-line procedure manual in the instrument software. 
Characterization of Waste   The Contractor shall provide documentation that it has characterized the hazardous nature of all wastes produced by all equipment, devices, reagents, and discharges in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations Title 40  Protection of the Environment  Part 261 et seq. and applicable state and local requirements. Documentation shall include a description of the characteristics of the hazardous waste produced as a byproduct of the instrument operations, Safety Data Sheets (SDS) meeting the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the analytical process used to determine the hazardous nature and characteristics of the waste, and the analytical test results. Testing of hazardous waste is to be done in accordance with testing protocol specified for each individual waste, as described in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 40, to make a determination if the waste is a hazardous waste or otherwise regulated. 
The determination and description shall address the following: 
Waste toxicity (Reference 40 CFR 261.11 and 40 CFR 261.24) 
Waste ignitability (Reference 40 CFR 261.21) 
Waste corrosivity (Reference 40 CFR 261.22) 
Waste reactivity (Reference 40 CFR 261.23) 
Hazardous waste from non-specific sources (F-listed) (Reference 40 CFR 261.31) 
Discarded commercial products (acutely toxic or P-listed and toxic or U-listed) (Reference 40 CFR 261.33) 
Solid Waste (Reference 40 CFR 261.2) 
Exclusions (Reference 40 CFR 261.4) 
The Contractor will provide written instructions and training material to ensure VHA laboratory staff are trained as needed to properly operate devices with special emphasis to managing and disposing of hazardous waste in accordance with EPA and state requirements. Additionally, the training provided by the Contractor must fulfill Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements for training as applicable to devices. 
Contractor shall provide a description of all wastes the process or equipment may discharge so that the facility can determine whether the discharge meets Local Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), State and Federal discharge requirements. At a minimum the characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity and toxicity as defined in 40 CFR 261 must be determined and documented. Any mercury containing reagents must be identified in any concentrations. All test results shall be provided. All listed chemicals (F, U, K and P) found in 40 CFR 261 shall be provided in product information and their concentrations documented. For those materials with a positive hazardous waste determination, a mechanism for the laboratory to meet local discharge requirements (i.e. mercury, thimerosol and formaldehyde) must be developed and SDS sheets must be provided in advance for review. At a minimum, documentation shall include, but not be limited to the concentration/measures of the elements and parameters listed below and must be included with Contractor response: 
Barium (Total) 
Cadmium (Total) 
Chromium (Total) 
Copper (Total) 
Cyanide (Total) 
Lead (Total) 
Mercury (Total) 
Nickel (Total) 
Silver (Total) 
Zinc (Total)
Arsenic (Total) 
Selenium (Total) 
Tin (Total) 
pH 
Flash point (to higher than 200 F) 
BOD; biochemical oxygen demand 
The documentation the Contractor provides will be used to work with the VAMC and the public and/or private organization (e.g., POTW) to determine whether or not the waste from each device can legally be disposed of via the sewerage system 
Standard and Quality of Performance - This paragraph establishes a standard of quality performance that shall be met before any equipment listed on scope of procurement is accepted by the Government. This also includes replacement, substitute machines and machines that are added or field modified after a system has demonstrated successful performance. The acceptance period shall begin on the installation date. It shall end when the equipment has met the standard of performance for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days by operating in conformance with the Contractor s technical specification or as quoted in any BPA at an effectiveness level of 90% or more. 
In the event the equipment does not meet the standard of performance during the initial 30 consecutive calendar days, the standard of performance tests shall continue on a day-by-day basis until the standard of performance is met for a total of 30 consecutive days. 
If the equipment fails to meet the standard of performance after 90 calendar days from the installation date, the user may, at his/her option, request a replacement or terminate the order in accordance with the provisions of FAR 52.212-4 entitled  Termination for cause.  (The Contractor shall receive revenue for tests reported during the 90-day acceptance period.) 
Operational use time for performance testing for a system is defined as the accumulated time during which the machine is in actual use. System failure downtime is that period of time when any machine in the system is inoperable due to equipment failure. Downtime for each incident shall start from the time the Government makes a bona fide attempt to contact the Contractor s designated representative at the prearranged contact point until the system or machine(s) is returned to the Government in proper operating condition. 
During the performance period for a system, a minimum of 100 hours of operational use time with productive or simulated work shall be required as a basis for computation of the effectiveness level. However, in computing the effectiveness level, the actual number of operational use hours shall be used when in excess of the minimum of 100 hours. 
The Government will maintain daily records to satisfy the requirements of the Standard and Quality of Performance section and shall notify the Contractor in writing of the date of the first day of the successful period of operation. Operations use time and downtime shall be measured in hours and whole minutes. 
During the term of the contract, should the repair record of any individual piece of laboratory equipment reflect a downtime of 10% or greater of the normal working days in one calendar month, a determination shall be made by the COR to replace the malfunctioning equipment with new equipment. The responsibility for maintaining the equipment furnished in good condition in accordance with manufacturer s instructions, shall be solely that of the Contractor. Each instrument provided by the Contractor shall maintain an uptime of 90% in each month of the term of the agreement for equipment. 
Government s Responsibility- The user will perform routine maintenance and cleaning as required in the manufacturer s operation and maintenance instructions. The user shall maintain appropriate records to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph. 
Ownership of Equipment- Title to the equipment shall remain with the Contractor. All accessories (unused consumables, etc.) furnished by the Contractor shall accompany the equipment when returned to the Contractor. The Contractor, upon expiration of order(s), at termination and/or replacement of equipment, shall remove the equipment. The Contractor shall disconnect the analyzer (gas, water, air, etc.) and shall be responsible for all packing and shipping required to remove the analyzer. 
The Contractor will identify if removable media is required to perform their duties. The Clinical Engineering Department will ensure the removable media is scanned with anti-virus software running current virus definitions prior to connection to any medical device/system. Any Contractor with patient sensitive information that is imported into the removable media device for any reason must purge all patient sensitive information prior to departure from the facility. 
Prior to termination or completion of this contract, Contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the Contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a Contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the Contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination or completion of the contract. 
All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the BPA or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the Contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the Contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the Contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the Contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination or completion of the contract or disposal or return of the IT equipment, whichever is earlier. 
Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the Contractor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are: 
Contractor must accept the system without the drive; 
VA s initial medical device procurement includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or 
VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase. 
Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then; 
The equipment Contractor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has protected health information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and 
Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the contract. 
A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The Information Security Officer (ISO) needs to maintain the documentation.

The Kansas City VA Medical Center are replacing their expansion joints. Contractor will provide all tools, materials, labor and supervision to remove and replace 16 Expansion Joints at the Kansas City VA Medical Center, 4801 East Linwood Boulevard, Kansas City, MO 64128.
Contractor will have a minimum of 5 years of documented experience on projects of similar scope, size and magnitude as the Kansas City VA Medical Center.
No government furnished labor, materials, tools or equipment will be used or provided.
All project activities at the Medical Center will be done during non-business hours. Non-business hours are from 5:00PM-6:00AM, M-F and on weekends and holidays.
All contract personnel who will be working at the Kansas City VA Medical Center will attend a mandatory 1-hour safety and infection control training. This is a one-time training and is valid for one year. The training class occurs every Tuesday morning at 7:00AM in Building 6. Upon completion of the training, the contract personnel will then proceed to the 5th Floor in Building 15 to obtain a VA Identification Badge. The badge must always be worn while working on Medical Center property.
Provide an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approved, expansion joint assembly at locations indicated below. Contractor will first remove the existing expansion joint. With the existing expansion joint gap exposed, the concrete nose edges will be resurfaced and given a completely straight and level edge. To minimize the possibility of a trip hazard while passing over the expansion joint, the contractor will make sure there is no height variation from one side of the expansion joint to the other side. After the expansion joint has been prepared, the contractor will place new expansion joint material, using a 2-part polyurethane resin, such as Belzona, Balco (or equivalent), poured in the place of the old expansion joint. The entire process and procedure will be installed according to manufactures instructions and by factory trained and certified installers. Contractor will provide a copy of the manufacturer s installation instructions to the COR, prior to the start of project activities. New expansion joints will accommodate for joint size and height variations in adjacent surfaces, and the anticipated movement at the joint. Match or exceed the Fire/Smoke rating of the floor at the location of the expansion joints.
Unless approved in writing by the COR, each expansion joint will be completed in its entirety before starting on another. At each expansion joint, the contractor will completely remove the entire expansion joint, to include all materials, hardware and adhesives prior to installing any new expansion joint materials. 
All work shall be installed in a neat and workmanlike manner. If the COR determines that certain parts of the installation is not satisfactory, the contractor will re-do the affected area at no cost to the government. Contractor will clean and remove all debris from the work area daily.
After contract award, a pre-construction meeting will be conducted to:
Coordinate project schedule.

Infection control; dust control, fire retardant plastic barriers and negative air requirements using HEPA filtration at each location. The plastic barrier will be inspected prior to starting any work by a representative of the Infection Prevention Office. In the event of a true lifesaving, fire or disaster emergency, the plastic construction barrier will be removed by contractor to allow free flow of egress traffic. Contractor will provide a temporary overlay for emergencies so wheeled traffic can cross over bridged expansion joint.
Construction Barrier will never be left unattended by contractor except for the period when the epoxy is curing.
Contractor will maintain the fire rating of the floor at the end of each work shift. A UL approved firestopping brick/block or putty will be an approved temporary measure to maintain fire rating provided that the firestopping completely fills all voids and cavities.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) has a specific requirement to provide Combat Aviation Advisors (CAA) to foreign partner nations operating A-29s. AFSOC requires a home station A-29 training capability to accomplish this mission. This training capability is currently a gap that the USAF will address with the acquisition of one to three LAA A-29 aircraft.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The SNC A-29 is currently proliferated across Partner Nations (PNs) with additional PNs in the process of procuring more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>AFSOC's current CAA mission includes training and qualifying AFSOC A-29 Instructor Pilots (IPs) who are then deployed to PNs operating A-29s to provide teaching, mentoring, consultation, and advice on employing the A-29.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>AFSOC pilots, after CAA training in CONUS, embed with PN air forces at their home locations, flying PN aircraft, and teaching PN pilots how to best employ the weapon system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CAA objective is to enhance PNs' ability to effectively employ the A-29 as a weapon system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The result will be to enable PNs to better accomplish Counter Violent Extremist Operations mission requirements in support of their own Foreign Internal Defense strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Currently, AFSOC IPs train on foreign-owned A-29 aircraft. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>As these aircraft are delivered to foreign nations, AFSOC will lose the ability to train and certify IPs on the A-29 in the absence of US-owned aircraft.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">It is anticipated that a formal solicitation will be released in 1Q FY20 and a contract will be awarded in the 1Q FY20.

<DESC><p>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) intends to extend the five (5), multiple award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts: NNA15AB11B Bell Textron Inc.; NNA15AB12B The Boeing Company; NNA15AB13B Georgia Technology Applied Research Corporation (GTARC); NNA15AB14B Monterey Technologies, Inc. (MTI); and NNA15AB15B Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. The performance period will be extended for a possible&nbsp;twelve (12) months from December 5, 2019 through December 4, 2020, consisting of a six (6) month base period and three, two-month option periods. There will be no increase in the current contract ceiling value of $40,000,000.  A contract modification reflecting this extension will be issued on or before December 4, 2019, the expiration date of the contracts.</p>
<p>The contractors provide task order assignments of technology assessments, analysis, design, fabrication, and testing requirements (model-scale, full-scale, and flight) with rotorcraft, including but not limited to aerodynamics, structures, computational fluid dynamics, acoustics, comprehensive analysis, cockpit design and control systems, handling qualities, human factors, prognostics and health management assessments, and systems and economics analysis.</p>
<p>Currently the contractors provide studies to analyze advanced/emerging/leap frog technologies and the potential payoff to the national airspace system passenger, rotorcraft operator, and rotorcraft manufacturer: identifies and review concepts of technology insertion to existing fleets, new rotorcraft variants, or entirely new vertical lift aircraft;   analyzes designs, develop technology plans, identify critical technologies and areas of technical risk, and develop alternative risk mitigation plans; provides operational wind  tunnel test stands (including  all cabling and control consoles) for model helicopter/tilt rotor testing in Government and private industry  test facilities; applies computational fluid dynamics (CFD), aeroacoustics, comprehensive analysis, and other advanced computational methods for the computation and prediction of rotor aerodynamic loads and acoustics, airfoil design, vibration prediction and alleviation, and computation of interactional aerodynamic effects between various vehicle components (rotor, fuselage, tail, wings, other rotors); executes design and testing of model- and full-scale rotor systems and vehicle concepts involving aerodynamics, acoustics, structures, and dynamics; performs analysis, design, fabrication, instrumentation, data acquisition, data reduction, correlation, and reporting; and provides appropriate nationally recognized experts in any number of rotary wing technology areas as required to meet Government needs for reviewing, critiquing, and providing expert advice in Government-funded, directed, or conducted research.</p>
<p>The extension will not increase the current contract ceiling value of $40,000,000. The current contractors, Bell Textron Inc.,&nbsp;The Boeing Company,&nbsp;GTARC, MTI, and Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. are considered the only contractors that can meet ARC's needs given the short period of performance for the extension period.  Awarding a twelve (12) month contract to another source, at the same time as the re-competition of the follow-on is in process, would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements, affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARC's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30 PM PST on November 13, 2019. Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>10/28/2019 -- Distributed Common Ground System  Navy Commercial Solution Opening------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ Purpose The purpose of this announcement is to notify Industry that the Distributed Common Ground System  Navy (DCGS-N) program anticipates the release of a Commercial Solution Opening (CSO), in accordance with Navy Memo Class Deviation Defense Commercial Solutions Opening Pilot Program, dated 26 June 2018, in order to procure potential prototype solutions for a Knowledge Base (KB) capability.--------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ What is a CSO? CSO is a merit-based source selection strategy to acquire innovative, commercial items, technologies or services that directly fulfill requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technological advances.   Contract awards may consist of Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) or Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based procurements. This process is similar to that of Broad Agency Announcements (BAA), which the science and technology community utilizes to acquire basic and applied research. Currently, under CSOs, Department of Defense (DoD) organizations with OT authority can acquire prototypes based on innovative technologies that are maturing into commercial applications. CSOs were authorized in the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) as part of the on-going efforts to improve the acquisition process and increase access to new technology. CSOs are a vehicle utilized to meet the needs of the warfighter and deliver rapid, relevant capabilities.  Please see Navy Memo Class Deviation  Defense Commercial Solutions Opening Pilot Program, dated 26 June 2018, and Fiscal Year 2017 NDAA section 879 for further details.------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------- For additional information regarding this announcement, see the attached special notice.

<CONTACT>Sara J. Torres , Contract Specialist , Email Sara.J.Torres@usace.army.mil
<DESC><br />The Corps of Engineers New England District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following construction project:
<p>The location of services to be performed under this contract shall be at the Natick Soldier Systems Center (NSSC), Natick, Massachusetts. This project will be to construct a new 80,600 SF laboratory building to include Administrative Space, Laboratory Space, Network Operations Center and a Soldier Performance Lab Area. The project will also include a back-up power supply generator. The project includes related infrastructure such as a parking area, mechanical rooms, site improvements and utility connections. Construction will also require the demolition of 2-existing buildings and supporting facilities within an area in close proximity to other active buildings at the NSSC.</p>
<p>The project will provide temporary swing space facilities during construction and will require the deconstruction of this temporary space after completion.</p>
<p>This project will occur on an active military installation, therefore, will include significant equipment and personnel management requirements to minimize impacts to the surrounding facilities and on-going activities. The contractor will also have a defined work area with limited access and all contractor personnel shall be screened for security purposes.</p>
<p><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement,<br />producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement<br />Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>a. Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>

<p>A multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Construction throughout New England awarded to up to 6 Offerors. with a total value of up to $90,000,000 total. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220. The Contracts' ordering period is expected to be 5 years.</p>
<p>The scope of work will consist of a broad range of construction tasks to include but not limited to minor new construction, renovation, repairs, upgrades, alterations, and preventive maintenance for vertical construction-type projects. The scope of work for vertical construction may include but is not limited to: structural systems, roof systems, mechanical <br />systems, plumbing systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, fire suppression systems, fire alarm systems, electrical systems, telecommunication systems, building  security systems, and associated civil/site features (utilities, storm water and wastewater management, parking, roadways, grading, landscaping, and site security).

<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a.	Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b.	An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>c.	Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>d.	Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>1.	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>2.	The complexity of the project.</p>
<p>3.	Shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>4.	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>5.	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.</p>
<p>6.	The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.</p>
<p>7.	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.</p>
<p>8.	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p><br />In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a.	Should a PLA be executed on the above described Construction Project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the construction project?</p>
<p>b.	Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c.	Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>

<DESC><p align="left">Goodfellow Air Force Base (GAFB) is conducting a commercial solutions opening (CSO) authorized by section 879 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (Pub. L. 114&#8208;328). Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to ageneral solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement (BAA), to acquire innovativecommercial items, technologies, and services, based on a review of proposals by scientific,technological, or other subject&#8208;matter expert peers within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items,technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items.</p>
<p align="left">The Air Force intends to obtain "Innovative"solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfillrequirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutionsmay include existing technologies or procedures that are not currently in use by the Air Force that would enhance or streamline Air Force mission capabilities. Based on available funding, the Air Force is targeting solutions priced less than $250,000. However, the Air Force will still evaluate proposed solutions priced greater than $250,000. <br /><br />"Innovative"is defined as any technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It also includes any new application of an existing technology, process, or method. <br /><br />This CSO contains broadly defined areas of interest and interest in more specific requirements. While these areas of interest are geared toward meeting GAFB requirements, the Air Force reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements outside of GAFB with similar areas of interest and mission requirements.</p>
<p align="left">GAFB will utilize an open, two&#8208;step CSO evaluation process. In phase 1, offerors must submit a white paper and a pitch deck for evaluation. Once the evaluations are complete, all offerors will be notified as to whether they will be invited to pitch their proposal at a Pitch Day event (phase 2).</p>
<p align="left">Offerors that are selected will receive an invitation to make a live pitch to the GAFB team during a Pitch Day event to be held mid&#8208;January in San Angelo, TX. Offerors will pitch their solution to evaluators and will be immediately notified if they were selected for an award.</p>
<p align="left">In order to expedite funds, the Government intends to pay this contract with the Government Purchase Card (GPC); which is just the Government credit card, but this will require you to have the ability to accept a credit card payment at this event for payment.</p>
<p align="left">Further information on GAFB Pitch Day will be made available as the event date gets closer. Any questions or concerns can be addressed via e&#8208;mail to Zachary Stone: zachary.stone.3@us.af.mil or SrA Joseph Montgomery: joseph.montgomery.11@us.af.mil</p>

The exceptions to this restriction are Washington and Minnesota Enhanced Driver's Licenses (EDLs) which display a red, white and blue American flag on the front of the ID card. EDLs exceed REAL ID Act guidelines and are considered acceptable forms of identification. Standard issue driver's licenses from the above states, however, are not compliant.</p>
<p>(2) There is no change for base access to individuals who already possess military issued credentials; non-DoD personnel without base access credentials will be the largest demographic affected by REAL ID Act requirements. Identity proofing was done using approved identification credentials with a background check conducted through law enforcement authoritative databases. That will not change on October 10, 2018.</p>
<p>(3) What will change is which ID's for proof of identity will be accepted. The forms of ID on this list are for use solely at Tinker AFB and several ID's on this list may not grant you entry for other Federal Facilities or military bases. If you are travelling to other Federal Installations/buildings it is recommended you contact them before travelling to that location. Tinker AFB acceptable alternative forms of ID are the following:<br />- U.S. Passport<br />- U.S. Passport Card<br />- PIV or Federally-issued PIV<br />- Driver's License issued by the U.S Department of State<br />- Border Crossing Card (Form DSP-150)<br />- DHS "Trusted Traveler" Cards<br />- U.S. Military ID<br />- Veteran's Health Identification Card<br />- U.S. Permanent Resident Card (Form 1-551)<br />- U.S. Certificate of Naturalization (Form N-550)<br />- Employment Authorization Document issued by DHS (Form 1-766)<br />- U.S. Refugee Travel Document (Permit to Re-enter form 1-327 and Refugee Travel Document <br />Form 1-571)<br />- Transportation Worker<br />- Identification Credential (TWIC)<br />- Merchant Mariner Card issued by USCG<br />- A state driver's license or ID that meets the REAL ID standards or has an extension<br />- State-issued EDLs<br />- Interim Driver's License issued by a state that meets the REAL ID standards or has an extension<br />- Native American Tribal Photo ID<br />- Foreign government-issued passport<br />- PIV-I cards<br />- Non-Real ID Act Driver's License supplemented with documentation listed:<br />- Social Security Card<br />- Birth Certificate<br />- Voter Registration Card<br />- State Issued Concealed Carry License<br />- State Issued Vehicle Registration<br />(4) All visitors are required to have the proper identification to access an Air Force installation. A REAL ID Act compliant credential will be required to establish individual identity. Those who do not have the accepted documentation for installation access will not be permitted to enter the base without an approved escort (contractors cannot escort other contractors).</p>
<p>(5) Delivery drivers will be required to receive an access pass and background check. It should only add a few minutes to the delivery time, provided the delivery driver meets the criteria for receiving an access pass. In order to conduct the background check, a REAL ID Act compliant credential will be required to establish individual identity. Those who do not have the accepted documentation for installation access will not be permitted to enter the base without an approved escort.</p>
<p>(6) There is no change for base access to individuals who already possess military issued credentials. Those incoming employees who do not currently have military issued credentials will need identity proofing using approved identification credentials with a background check conducted through law enforcement authoritative databases.</p>

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: Price and technical acceptability. A best value award will be made utilizing the lowest price technically acceptable. 
(b) Additional Instructions to offerors concerning Grey Market items- 
The VHA (Veterans Health Administration) will not accept  Grey Market Goods . 
Grey market goods are defined as: Gray Market Goods also known as parallel market, is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer. 
Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety. In some instances, unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(a) Gray market items are Original Equipment Manufacturer s (OEM) goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors. This procurement is for new OEM medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts) for VA Medical Centers. No remanufactures or gray market items will be acceptable.

(b) Vendor shall be an OEM, authorized dealer, authorized distributor or authorized reseller for the proposed medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts), verified by an authorization letter or other documents from the OEM, such that the OEM s warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM. All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

(c) The delivery of gray market items to the VA in the fulfillment of an order/award constitutes a breach of contract. Accordingly, the VA reserves the right to enforce any of its contractual remedies. This includes termination of the contract or, solely at the VA s election, allowing the Vendor to replace, at no cost to the Government, any remanufactured or gray market item(s) delivered to a VA medical facility upon discovery of such items.

Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately 12 March&nbsp;2020, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Skin Staplers. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Skin Staplers.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Skin Staplers. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $417,661. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($417,661) of the total volume in sales ($417,661). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br />1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample.

<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver.

<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.<br />(a)	Definitions.<br />Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.<br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.<br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull;	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull;	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull;	The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.<br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b)	Requirements.<br />1.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.<br />2.	The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.<br />3.	If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract.

Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.

<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office Ombudsman (Oct 2016) NAM<br />a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.<br />b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance<br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>

</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">USAID and Liberia maintain a long-standing partnership to support economic stability and growth, strengthen democratic governance, and improve health and education systems. USAID/Liberia fosters a spirit of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, building and supporting local systems so there is no longer a need for external support. USAID/Liberia is the first bi-lateral program to have an approved 2019-2024 Country Development Cooperation Strategy; the Mission is in the midst of designing and procuring a significant number of new activities, and the Mission fully embraces the Agency&rsquo;s newly issued Acquisition and Assistance Strategy as well as the Effective Partnering and Procurement Reform Initiative.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">Given the quantity, complexity, and high dollar value of current instruments and future designs, USAID/Liberia is seeking Senior Acquisition and Assistance (A&amp;A) Specialists who are highly skilled, experienced, self-motivated, and who is capable of independently performing quality and professional work in an expedited manner and under stressful conditions. The Senior A&amp;A Specialist will serve as USAID/Liberia's senior acquisition specialist and key advisor to the Supervisory Contracting Officer for all A&amp;A matters. The&nbsp; OAA specialist will be part of the Mission&rsquo;s acquisition<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>staff, and should provide expert advice on how to leverage the tools of procurement to more effectively advance USAID&rsquo;s goals, and should identify opportunities to assist mission staff in improving their Contracting/Agreement Officer Representative (C/AOR) skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">The Senior A&amp;A Specialist is responsible for providing the full range of A&amp;A services in support of USAID/Liberia's foreign assistance objectives.&nbsp; S/he will be required to apply highly specialized A&amp;A knowledge, skills, and abilities involving a variety of actions that range from simplified acquisition to complex multi-million dollar, multi-year awards. This includes providing support to the Development Objective portfolios on all aspects of contract/award management relating to and affecting USAID assistance programs, policy and project planning, design, implementation, learning and evaluation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">The incumbent will oversee the contractual actions for multiple USAID portfolios that are estimated at over $515 million. S/he will represent the OAA and the Supervisory Contracting Officer (SCO) in providing design feedback for new activities and will be responsible for reviewing A&amp;A package documents to ensure completion in preparation for final review and approval by the Contracting/Agreement Officer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">The Senior A&amp;A Specialist will report to the Supervisory Contracting Officer and may be called upon to manage one or more Development Objective (DO) portfolios. S/he will be responsible for mentoring up to four (4) Cooperating Country National (CCN) staff members and is expected to further develop these employees&rsquo; skills. The incumbent will be expected to participate in the federally-mandated Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) program, including planning and performing on-the-job training assignments and coursework to ensure successful completion of the required competencies and annual training requirements to receive a CO/AO warrant of at least $10 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">The incumbent is expected to work primarily in accomplishing the specific tasks as outlined below.&nbsp; Given the nature of the position, the Senior A&amp;A Specialist will also be expected to respond to any changes in priorities that emerge during the contract period to provide efficient, timely, and effective services to the Mission.</span></p>

The Offeror also shall enter its Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) indicator, if applicable. The EFT indicator is a four-character suffix to the unique entity identifier. The suffix is assigned at the discretion of the Offeror to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative EFT accounts (see subpart 32.11) for the same entity. If the Offeror does not have a unique entity identifier, it should contact the entity designated at www.sam.gov for unique entity identifier establishment directly to obtain one. The Offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the entity designated at www.sam.gov for establishing the unique entity identifier. <br />(k) Reserved. <br />(l) Debriefing. If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: <br />(1) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. <br />(2) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. <br />(3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. <br />(4) A summary of the rationale for award; <br />(5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. <br />(6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.212-2, EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) Past performance and (ii) Price (see FAR 15.304); and include them in the relative order of importance of the evaluation factors, such as in descending order of importance.)<br />Past Performance is equal to price.<br />Past Performance. This consists of two parts. Offers are to provide a summary of past work within these areas: <br />- Relevance - Relevance addresses how closely past work associates with the current requirement. <br />- Recency - Performance older than 3 years may not be rated as highly as performance in the past year. <br />There is no minimum number of projects or contracts to be listed. Provide narrative regarding the size of the requirements (scope and dollar magnitude) and to the kind of customer (military, etc...). References are encouraged. <br />Relevance will be judged on the following scale:<br />Past Performance Relevance Ratings<br />Rating Definition<br />Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Based on evaluation results of the 2 Past Performance Subfactors, the Past Performance Factor will be assigned one of the following Performance Confidence Assessments:<br />Performance Confidence Assessments<br />Rating Definition<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Neutral No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be assigned. The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Price. While price is an important factor, it is not more important than Past Performance. Price must be reasonable and it must reflect market pricing. Pricing that is too low may be deemed as unrealistic, and could be interpreted to mean the offeror does not account for all of the cost implications of the work.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)<br />The following clauses below applies to this acquisition:<br />52.203-18 Prohibition on Contracting With Entities That Require Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements--Representation JAN 2017 <br />52.204-3 <br />52.204-7<br />52.204-9 Taxpayer Identification <br />System for Award Management<br />Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel OCT 1998<br />OCT 2018<br />JAN 2011 <br />52.204-24 Representation Regarding Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">Please see attached RFQ and all attachments to provide an accurate quotation.<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1.<strong> </strong>Can you please provide a screenshot of the previous maintenance check list?<br /><br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">We have determined that we cannot share the previous maintenance checklist because it was created by the contractor and we do not have their permission to share this. Additionally the previous contract covered more than is requested under this RFQ. It is best to quote in accordance with the PWS which outlines the Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Semi-Annual inspection areas</span><br /><br />2. Can you please provide the previous contract number?<br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The most recent contract number covering this facility's maintenance is FA527019PA041.<br /><br />3. Does Item 0001 cover regular maintenance as well as repairs of USD 200 or less, and any repairs over USD 200 are to be invoiced separately for an additional fee?</span></p>
<p>Please see PWS paragraphs 1.3.2.2. and subsequent 1.3.2.3. The contractor will implement a preventive maintenance inspection program. Resulting from a preventative maintenance inspection, a job order number will be assigned to each deficiency requiring "emergency" or "urgent" response times, or deficiencies requiring resources estimated to exceed $200.00. CLIN 0001 covers in schedule, preventive maintenance.</p>
<p>4. Is Item 0002 a fixed service fee for each repair, excluding expenses?</p>
<p>CLIN 0002 is the hourly rate to be invoiced for out of schedule maintenance. CLIN 0003 shall be invoiced for parts and materials.</p>
<p>5. We would like to know the manufacturer of the halon cylinder that is stored inside the facility.</p>
<p>Response from the end user, "I attempted to find the manufacturer of the halon cylinders. However, the bottles are in Japanese. I have also looked through countless documents but cannot find the manufacturer nor supplier. This was handled through the facility contract. The previous contractor told me the bottles are no longer procurable because they do not make them."</p>
<p>6. We would like to know the brand/manufacturer of the control panels for the halon cylinders</p>
<p>Pictures are attached for reference but exact information is unknown.</p>
<p>7. We were informed that the halon cylinders were to be replaced by another contractor during our site visit, but where is the line drawn between the other contractor's responsibility and the scope of work for this project?</p>
<p>The possible halon system replacement will be part of a Charrette contract. If approved, the replacement is an effort to go with a more environmentally "clean" agent called Novec. As of right now, we are in the process of having a Study for Design accomplished to determine if the bottles/system will be replaced, along with additional structural enhancements. If the Halon systems are replaced we will consider a bilateral modification for this contract/PWS with the separate Fire Suppression System contract in mind to assure a clear line is drawn.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the answers from questions received during the site visit of the solicitation process.
Question and Response
Chiller #4 Overhaul - Site Visit   10/21/2019


1.Please verify that an OSHA 30 certified Supervisor is necessary pursuant to the scope.
The Malcom Randall VA Medical Center requires a Supervisor on sight that is OSHA 30 certified any time work is being performed on the job.

2.Please verify that a parts list of Trane OEM parts is to accompany the Proposal.

Trane OEM parts must be used on the ten year overhaul. How the Contractor puts together their proposal is up to the Contractor. 

3.Please verify that both sets of needle bearings in the compressor require replacement pursuant to the solicitation.

Both sets of needle bearings must be replaced.

4.The term in the SOW for technicians appears to mean that a factory and/or manufacturers authorized technician must be on the jobsite at all times, is this correct? Does this include the time necessary for rigging personnel to prepare rigging before work on the Chiller begins? There is a significant amount of rigging necessary and it may be cost beneficial to the VA if contractor personnel dedicated to rigging can prepare the machine for work for the technician, or otherwise stated should the technician requirement apply to times the Trane chiller is being serviced only?

A Trane certified technician must be there actually working on the Chiller. Pulling refrigerant, staging equipment, rigging etc. does not have to be done by the Trane certified mechanic. 

5.There is a significant amount of rigging involved due to obstructions above and around the chiller that a simple gantry will not be able to be utilized. It was mentioned that Siemens is in the process of installing Demandflow, will any controls components, conduit, or other devices/apertures be installed between the site visit and end of anticipated performance period in solicitation?

There will not be anything installed in the near future.

6.It was mentioned during the site visit a cooling tower fill replacement project was planned during performance period that runs off another chiller and both systems will not be able to be done at same time. Does one project take priority, or will basis be on who schedules work first?

Work will have to be coordinated. The Cooling Tower Fill replacement is supposed to take about two weeks. The Chiller Overhaul should take about two weeks. We should be able to get both jobs done this winter.

7.Please verify disabling of the controls system will be scheduled by the Contractor through the COR and disabled by the VA for the Chiller overhaul.

We will open and lock out the main breaker for the Chiller for the entire project. Contractors will be expected to use proper lockout tagout procedures while working on the Chiller.

8.It was mentioned during the site visit that if additional refrigerant is needed during refill of the coolant system that the VA will provide any additional refrigerant needed if found to not have enough refrigerant when removed, please confirm.

We will by any refrigerant that is needed at the end of the job if it is needed. 

9.Please verify the ceiling is viable for rigging if needed.

The ceiling is not available for rigging.

10. What parts and labor warranty applies to this solicitation? (90 day, 1,2 or 5 years are the manufacturers options).

We would like a five warranty on any and all new parts installed. 


ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED!

<DESC>28 October 2019: INDUSTRY DAY UPDATE&nbsp;
<p>Information for the ATSSI Industry Day has been attached to this FBO posting including the Industry Day Itinerary, Industry Day presentation charts, and a map to the building.<br /><br />One on one meetings are limited to 30 minutes. Please come with technical questions from the draft PWS as opposed to a company history or capability presentation.<br /><br />For the Industry Day tour please wear comfortable, closed toed shoes. There will be some walking between buildings so dress appropriately. No food or drink will be allowed on the tour.<br /><br />INDUSTRY DAY NOTIFICATION<br />Industry Day will be held on October 30-31, 2019.&nbsp; <br /><br />The tentative schedule is as follows:<br /><br />30 Oct 19<br />AM: Introduction, Site Visit, and Q&amp;A Session<br />PM: One-on-Ones<br /><br />31 Oct 19<br />AM: One-on-Ones<br /><br /><br />Industry Day participants are capped at two (2) individuals&nbsp;per company.&nbsp; Please provide the names (first and last) of individuals attending and where they are traveling from.&nbsp; The Government will try to reserve&nbsp;the first day of One-on-Ones&nbsp;for companies that are flying in for the Industry Day.&nbsp; If individuals need Base Access, please provide their drivers&nbsp;license number and&nbsp;state&nbsp;it was&nbsp;issued in.&nbsp; <br />To ensure a One-on-One session is allotted for you, please identify in your response, your desire for a&nbsp;session.<br /><br />Maps and Instructions will be provided at a later date.<br /><br />Responses need to be submitted by October 15, 2019 at 8:00 a.m. (MT).<br />If you do not receive an email confirming receipt of your response by 3:00 p.m. (MT) on October 15, 2019, please contact us by phone no later than October 16, 2019 or your company will not be included as attending for the Industry Day.<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />A <strong>PWS</strong> has been added as well as <strong>Questions</strong>.&nbsp; Please provide your responses NLT 3 October 2019 at 12:00 PM MDT.<br />An Industry Day is planned for the end of October and more information&nbsp;will be posted at a later date.<br /><br />UPDATED QUESTIONS: (The government is seeking more clarity to the questions below).<br /><br />1. Section 3.6.4.1 in the Draft PWS refers to an "OCI Mitigation Plan". How would your company comply with this requirement? This example highlights the Government's concern. If Company X is awarded the ATSSI 2 Contract, they will be in a position to research, identify requirements, and suggest solutions to the Government. If Company X develops test equipment that can fulfill the Government's requirements, the perceived OCI would occur, particularly if Company X identifies their own solutions to the problem. Company Y, who offers competitive products to Company X, would then perceive an unfair advantage to Company X in influencing the Government's decisions. Additionally, if Company Y's solution were selected, Company X would be in a position to have access to proprietary information from Company X. <br /><br />a. The two issues that need to be addressed in an answer is:<br />i. How would you mitigate the first situation's perceived OCI?<br />ii. How would you mitigate the second situation's OCI to protect proprietary data?<br /><br />2. Subcontracting plan: As the ATSSI Prime, there will be many instances of subcontracting work to other companies. How would your company protect the Government from unfair and/or excessive pass-through costs? See Section 3.6.4.2 of the Draft PWS.&nbsp;<br /><br />Please send responses&nbsp;to the POC's listed below.<br /><br />&nbsp;END OF UPDATE_______________________________________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri"><span>&bull;1.<span style="FONT: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />The Government is seeking potential sources to support a follow-on contract for its AUTOMATED TEST SYSTEM SUSTAINMENT INITIATIVE (ATSSI). <br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />The 309 Maintenance Wing at Hill AFB (309 MXW) has a large volume of Automated Test Systems (ATS) that support end items from several different Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), incorporate ancillary equipment from various vendors in the build/design, and require coordination with multiple OEMs/vendors when such systems are modified, repaired, or replaced. Many of these systems are unique to 309 MXW and as such, have no commercial equivalent. <br /><br />309 MXW is facing operation, maintenance, performance, and infrastructure support issues for a growing number of computer-based test stations. Many of these systems are obsolete, duplicative, do not properly interface with Units Under Test (UUT), require unique/costly repair solutions, and/or require specialized sustainment in order to remain operable. 309 MXW established the original ATSSI contract to integrate, update, and consolidate ATS, test fixtures, TPS, database repositories, analytical software tools, and network infrastructures. <br /><br />SCOPE <br />The follow-on ATSSI program is referred to as ATSSI II. Under ATSSI II the contractor shall serve as a complete ATS integrator and be fully capable of supporting design, manufacture, validation/verification, delivery, installation, drafting, Technical Order (TO) changes/updates, software, hardware, OEM coordination, System Program Office (SPO) coordination, test program sets, trouble shooting, government data rights concerns, and any other requirements identified throughout the pre-solicitation phase for this program. <br />A draft PWS with additional information will be posted at a later date. <br />Action <br />Please review and respond to the RFI questions below. Your responses are a critical part of the market research process and will aid the Government in determining industry capability and acquisition strategy. <br /><br />RFI QUESTIONS<br />1. Please provide your Company Name, Cage Code and size under NAICS 541512<br />2. Please identify any recent &amp; relevant DoD/commercial contracts<br /><br />Capability Survey<br />1.

<p>4. What are your company's configuration control standards or protocols?</p>
<p>5. What is your company's experience working with organizational conflict of interest (OCI) issues? Has your company developed an OCI mitigation plan in the past?</p>
<p>6. What is your company's experience with government data rights requirements and clauses?</p>
<p>7. Does your company maintain close relationships with any major manufacturers or suppliers of widely-used ATS COTS components?</p>
<p>a. What is the basis of, or how formal are these relationships?<br />b. How long have these relationships been maintained?<br />c. Provide examples of specific relationships</p>
<p>8. Does your company have the resources available to quickly analyze ATS failures, perform root cause analysis, and repair or quickly subcontract the repair of typical ATS?</p>
<p>a. Provide two examples of situations where your company has provided this service</p>
<p>9. Provide a brief overview of your company's capability for developing, maintaining and repairing both software and hardware for ATS and all associated documentation updates.</p>

<h1 style="mso-list: none"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The 402nd Aircraft Maintenance Group (AMXG) at Robins AFB, GA, has a requirement for a turnkey Digital Dectector Array (DDA) within B144. The DDA must use the latest in digital scanning and DDA design to optimize the F-15 vertical as defined in F-15 T.O. 1F-15C-36, pages 4-136 through 138, F-15 T.O. 1F-15C-36 page 3-4, and C-5 T.O. 1C-5M-36: page 3-17. The speed from beginning to end including start up and processing time to store information collected from the DDA shall be under four (4) hours for any single task listed in the technical order above. This will be a one-time supply requirement.</span></h1>
<h1 style="mso-list: none"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">At a minimum, the following will be needed. The CNC rails are to be reviewed and replaced and/or repaired. (We know there are at least two broken welds and the rails all need cleaning at minimum.) Operation should be smooth between all transitions. The electrical system will require new PLC, motor drives, motors and interconnecting cables at a minimum. This will eliminate the need to home the system when there is a power failure or if an outside force moves the manipulator. The control software needs to be replaced to operate with the updated drives and PLC system. New software should be able to operate on Windows 10, 64 bit operating system. The DDA source generator and tube need to be of the latest commercially available tehcnology. The water cooler for the DDA tube needs to be replaced. The high voltage cable needs to be replaced at a minimum. The DDA detector and software also needs to be updated to current imaging system and software that can operate on Windows 10. Detector should be larger than the current one allowing for more imaging space with a smaller pixel size than the current system. A new system can operate off of one computer and use LCD screens allowing for more space in the control room. As much flexibility to upgrade DDA head, computer system, and monitoring systems needs to be concerned and implemented with the upgrade. Capturing of images needs to be at a resolution equal or greater than our current DDA method. Captured images need to be able to be digitally store and print files. Storage space shall be at a minimum 2 TB with file sizes being under 0.5 GB with the ability to upgrade system without the contractor. </span>See attached Purchase Description for further details. (Note: CDRL forms referenced in the PD will be provided at the time of formal solicitation.)<br /><br />See attached Sources Sought Synopsis with Contractor Capability Survey and Draft Product Description for additional information.</h1>

Airport Technology Research & Development Contract Strategy Industry Day 


The FAA William J Hughes Technical Center is planning an Industry Day on December 3, 2019 to discuss the acquisition strategy relative to the Airport Technology Research and Development (ATRD) program. 


For those interested in supporting the ATRD program, the Industry Day will provide information on the revised approach the FAA has adopted in procuring the services needed to support this program. 


Historically, support for ATRD has been procured primarily through one multi-year contract vehicle. In recent years, the ATRD portfolio has become more diverse and complex. This requires a new approach to effectively support the program. The FAA has identified distinct functional areas, programs, or projects that may be supported separately through various contract mechanisms. The various facets of this program and the specific acquisition strategies intended to be applied to each will be discussed.  


You are invited to join us to hear about the many new opportunities available to industry and academia to support this historically budgeted $33 Million a year program.  


Tours of the ATRD buildings and labs will take place in the afternoon to allow prospective bidders on future procurement opportunities to view the facilities. 


For additional information on the ATRD program, please visit their website:  https://www.airporttech.tc.faa.gov/ 



***THIS IS A FREE EVENT, HOWEVER, YOU MUST REGISTER TO ATTEND***        


The Agenda for the event is attached to this announcement.

Further obligations will arise as task orders are awarded and obligations will be charged to the fiscal year in which the order is placed. Services and supplies are required for 36 months starting 01 April 2020 through 31 March 2023. All elements of the RFP shall be submitted by the Offeror with a proposal no later than the date/time shown in block 8 of the Standard Form (SF) 1449, Solicitation/Contract Order for Commercial Items.</p>

This modification addresses:

Change of Set-Aside

<DESC>Single Source Justification (Simplified Acquisition)<br />Section A: General Contract Information<br />Contracting Activity: 1 SOCONS/LGCC Purchase Request Number:<br />F2F2189122AW01<br />Project/Program Name: 65 SOS Clear-Comm Headsets Estimated Contract Cost (including<br />Options):<br />Section B: Description of the Supplies/Services Required<br />Clear-Com specialized computing intercom system elements are used for the 65 SOS integration in the Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)<br />operations center and related weapon system control station. NSTISSAM TEMPEST 2-95/A, and also MIL-STD-461 E requirements,<br />approval for operations in a mixed-classification system that includes TS/SCI, XLR 4-F speaker connection, separate XLR 3-M<br />microphone connection, certified &gt;1 OODBi separation between channels, Noise Canceling Microphone, padded/adjustable<br />headband with articulating boom microphone mount.<br />Section C: Justification for Soliciting from a Single Source<br />The purchase of these brand items are required to maintain component compatibility during the execution of critical phases of flight for<br />Special Operations Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) missions, therefore acquisition of these items are essential to the Government's<br />requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. Additionally, this specific component is<br />the only item with security approval for this implementation. Not having this specific equipment would break the integrated architecture<br />and thusly remove centralized management interfacing and related efficiencies. Further, in addition to not being certified, inclusion of<br />different components will increase the probability of failure, and not allow full system to meet redundancy requirements. System failure<br />in this case would directly result in failure of the highest priority national missions. The specific equipment is part of the current<br />approved system baseline programs of record.<br />Section D: Efforts to Obtain Competition<br />The currently installed audio multi-level secure (A-MLS) is a 25th AF accredited system and no parts can be substituted without testing and<br />approval. The headsets in this system had to be specially modified to meet the classified decibel separation requirement for a MLS system<br />connected to a Top Secret audio system and a secret audio system at the same time. During the initial review process the engineers tested<br />standard headsets and found them all to have a significant level of mechanical coupling that caused cross talk within the headset that was<br />outside of the allowable decibel separation. The Clear-com company designed a specialized headset that met these DoD decibel separation<br />requirements. We jointly worked with Clear-com, Leidos, AFSOC and the 25th AF to have laboratory testing, certification and accreditation<br />completed. At this time no other headset is available on the market that is certified by the 25th AF for use in an audio MLS system that has full<br />listen all talk one capability. All items changed within this accredited audio system would require a Security Impact Assessment (SIA), laboratory<br />testing and accreditation approval prior to use. Any other type of headset cannot connect to this classified system without those steps<br />completed.<br />Section E: Steps to Preclude Future Single Source Awards<br />Prior to purchasing any future requirements, market research will be performed to determine whether similar capabilities exist in the<br />commercial industry at that time.<br />Section F: Contracting Officer's Determination<br />I have determined, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), that the circumstances of this contract action deem only a single<br />source is reasonably available.<br />Page 1 of 1

<DESC>Authority to Justify Sole Source Acquisition
The statutory authority to sole source this acquisition to the SDVOSB vendor is VAAR 819.7007 Sole source awards to a verified service-disabled Veteran-owned small business . As the type of equipment sought was subject to a Nonmanufacturer Rule Waiver, seeking SD/VOSBs and SB vendors was the preferred choice of the VA. As no other SDVOSB or VOSB was found in market research or responded to the Sources Sought Notice, the SDVOSB vendor showed confirmed business relationship to the manufacturer, and the SDVOSB vendor provided a fair and reasonable quote, the use of this VAAR authority is in the best interest of the VA.
