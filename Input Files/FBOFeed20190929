The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the<br />reason Market Research was not conducted.<br />The Government reviewed the Totara certified partners list at the Totara website and compared the<br />list to the list of GSA FSS Professional Services Schedule (PSS) contract holders. At the time there<br />were no other Totara partners, other than GP Strategies, that are available via GSA FSS.<br />Totara software is open source, highly flexible, and is used in a diverse range of sectors and<br />organizations for Learning Management System (LMS) delivery. Totara is an open source<br />distribution of Moodle developed for the corporate and government market. Totara is translated into<br />24 languages and has over 5 million subscribers. The current version of Totara LMS is 2.9 and is<br />based on Moodle 2.9. Totara releases a full but unsupported version of the product publicly via<br />Github prior to each major release.<br />Totara is a licensed product (see the agreement a https://www.totaralms.com/subagreement.pdf).<br />Though their license is much less expensive and more flexible than commercial LMS licenses, it<br />still places constraints on the use of the software. One of these constraints is that Totara LMS<br />hosting is only delivered through Totara-partnered corporations due to the expertise required for the<br />Page 5 Attachment 5 - AOP No. 5, J&amp;A - Other Than Full and Open Competition, 5/28/19<br />Totara solutions. No other vendor is authorized to provide this software licensing &amp; hosting or<br />allowed access to their code unless partnered with Totara.<br />GP Strategies Corporation is a certified partner with the Totara Corporation. Based on that<br />certification GP Strategies holds a unique and specialized ability to be able to provide USDA with<br />Totara October 1, 2019 through March 30, 2021 &amp; April 1, 20210 through September 30, 20210<br />October 1, 2019 through March 30, 2021 &amp; April 1, 20210 through September 30, 2021 needed to<br />develop and deploy the USDA LMS platform. Market research, as stated below, shows that no<br />other Totara platform holds a GSA FSS contract making GP Strategies even more unique in being<br />able to offer this support to Government Agencies.<br />GP Strategies Corporation is also currently providing support for hosting at AWS, system<br />architecture, design, configuration, development, and delivery with the Totara platform, also known<br />as phase 1 &amp; 2 of LMS development. This requirement is for continuation and finalizing of the<br />development, system release, and system support post go live for the final LMS system called<br />AgLearn. Under phase 1 &amp; 2 they have a developed platform already in place for USDA AgLearn<br />LMS and the Totara / Next Gen LMS Professional Services is to finalize and complete as stated<br />above. This information, in addition to the Totara partnership and only Totara partner available via<br />GSA FSS, supports the fact that the support required for USDA AgLearn is unique and specialized<br />and can only be completed successfully for USDA by GP Strategies.<br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.<br />Service rates offered on schedule have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by GSA.<br />The Government will seek additional discounts from contractor published rates for this requirement.<br />The level of support for this requirement of Totara / Next Gen LMS Professional Services for the<br />AgLearn LMS platform will be compared to the support utilized under the previous contract for<br />phase 1 &amp; 2 to ensure comparable use of resources to ensure best value of resources to the<br />Government.<br />The features and specialized services received in support and development of the LMS platform for<br />USDA will result in completion of the LMS next generation platform for Government use and the<br />best value possible due to contractor's specialized ability to work with the Totara framework<br />specifically within the USDA AgLearn system.<br />10.
