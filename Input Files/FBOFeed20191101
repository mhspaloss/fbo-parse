<DESC>The IAF seeks the impact evaluation services for two IAF projects that have been funded as part of IAF's Peace-Building Initiative in Colombia. An impact evaluation refers to analysis that provides evidence of changes that are attributable--that happen because of--a given intervention or project.
<p>Across IAF's grantmaking in Colombia, as in other countries, we are constantly asking ourselves: how do we know our grants are having the kinds of impacts we would expect? The specific question that emerges in the context of our Colombia Peace-Building Initiative is, how do we know our grantees are actually "building peace," however grantees define peace? To answer this question, IAF seeks to carry out an impact evaluation that uses a participatory, bottom-up approach.</p>

<div><strong>Requirement Background Information, Purpose and Objective:</strong><br />The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) established Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) as a federal corporation to encourage the growth of defined benefit pension plans, provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension benefits, and keep pension insurance premiums at a minimum.  Defined benefit pension plans promise to pay a specified monthly benefit at retirement, commonly based on salary and years on the job.  PBGC, a wholly owned United States Government corporation, administers the insurance program and termination process for most private-sector defined benefit pension plans that are tax-qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.  PBGC is headed by a Director who reports to a board of directors consisting of the Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, and Treasury, with the Secretary of Labor as Chairman.  General tax revenues do not fund PBGC.  PBGC collects insurance premiums from employers that sponsor insured pension plans, earns money from investments and receives the assets of the pension plans it terminates.  PBGC monitors the corporate events and transactions of defined benefit pension plan sponsors to mitigate risks to the insurance program and increase overall plan funding levels. <br />The purpose of this Synopsis/Pre-Solicitation is to notify potential Offerors that PBGC intends to solicit proposals to select a valuation and restructuring financial advisory services contractor to assist the agency in reviewing its interests in the Single Employer Plan Sponsor and exposure to the underfunded defined benefit pension plan(s) sponsored by the Single-Employer Pension Plan Sponsor.

<DESC><p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is issuing solicitation SPE4A2-17-R-0032 to support the H-53E Performance Based Sustainment Support Initiative. The purpose of this action is to add approximately 2,190 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) with a total estimated value of $212.5M to the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Long Term Contract (LTC) SPE4AX-15-D-9002 as a separate performance-based support subsumable contract with performance metrics and incentives/disincentives tied to achieving improved customer outcomes. This performance based project will include approximately 1,400 Sikorsky Sole Source NSNs. The solicitation will be unrestricted with a projected solicitation issuance date of 8 JAN 18 and a projected close date of 9 APR 18. The place of performance will be the Contiguous United States (CONUS). This population of items meets the definition of bundling at FAR 2.101, and it is likely unsuitable for award to a small business due to the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of the performance specified.</p>
<p>DLA has determined that measurably substantial benefits are expected to be derived as a result of the bundling as defined at FAR 7.107-3. The expected benefits of this bundling action are and summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Cost savings</p>
<p>(2) Price reduction</p>
<p>(3) Quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency</p>
<p>(4) Reduction in acquisition cycle times</p>
<p>(5) Better terms and conditions</p>
<p>(6) Anticipated financial benefits equivalent to five (5) percent of the estimated contract (including options)</p>
<p>The Government intends to use a letter solicitation; therefore, any interested sources must notify the contracting officer prior to the synopsis closing date and submit a complete response on how the offeror would provide the population of NSNs to support the H-53E including a complete response to the Government Sources Sought. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and Small Business Administration Procurement Center Representative (SBA PCR), michael.massello@sba.gov. The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if sufficient information is received on how another offeror can fully support the NSN population and provide the desired customer outcomes.</p>

<CONTACT>Richard D. Shemenski, Contracting Officer, Phone 6146921690, Email Richard.Shemenski@dla.mil
<DESC>NSN: 4820-01-157-8745. Item Description: Valve, Linear, Directional Control. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: CAGE (79318) P/N 240355-4.
<p><br />Quantity: 38. Unit of Issue: EA. Destination Information: CLIN 0001: San Diego, CA, CLIN 0002: Jacksonville, FL. Delivery Schedule: 365 days.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 27 SEP 2018. The Small Business size standard is 750 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source: Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc. (79318).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance, and the other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited: 25-50, and 51-76.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Program Operations (AJF) Service Unit contemplates an aircraft acquisition to standardize the Flight Program Operations current fleet of aircraft.   This market survey will support the first phase of the contemplated acquisition for four used (4) Bombardier Challenger 605/650s over a two (2)-year time period.

The purpose of this market survey/RFI is for the FAA to obtain market research and determine industrys capability to provide four used Bombardier Challenger 605/650s.  Responses to this market survey will be used to improve the FAAs understanding of the current market and assist with determining the appropriate acquisition strategy and approach.  The nature of competition for this acquisition has not been determined at this time. 

The following principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is being considered:

336411 - Aircraft Manufacturing

1.  BACKGROUND
The FAAs Flight Program Operations service unit is responsible for all aspects of FAA Flight Program safety, administration, operations, training, and maintenance. The Flight Program Operations service unit conducts four missions:

    Flight Inspection: Flight Program Operations ensures the integrity of instrument approaches and airway procedures that constitute our NAS infrastructure and addresses the Agencys international commitments. Flight Program Operations accomplishes this mission through the airborne inspection of all space and ground-based instrument flight procedures and the validation of electronic signals in space transmitted from ground navigation systems. Flight Program Operations also performs inspections for the Department of Defense (DOD) as essential to the defense of the United States both foreign and domestic.

    Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) Support: Flight Program Operations conducts flight and ground testing directly related to research, development, test, and evaluation of new electronic aids, air traffic procedures, aircraft improvement, and aviation medical research.

    Critical Event Response/Transportation: Flight Program Operations provides transportation required to accomplish official FAA responsibilities in times of emergency or disaster (hurricane response), as well as support the NTSB in carrying out its duties. Flight Program Operations also serves the transportation needs of DOT and FAA senior executives, and other federal agencies under reimbursable agreements, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

    Aviation Safety Training: Flight Program Operations provides formal training and currency/proficiency services to aviation safety inspectors and flight test personnel to ensure they remain qualified and current to operate FAA aircraft.

Flight Program Operations is responsible for operating and maintaining a fleet of aircraft to accomplish these missions.  The current fleet is comprised of 40 aircraft (twelve makes/models) with an average age of 23 years, including King Air 300, Lear 60, Challenger 601, Challenger 604, Challenger 605, King Air C90GTi, Bombardier Global Express, and Citation 560XL aircraft.

The FAA contemplates transitioning to a multiple-use aircraft strategy to decrease the number of makes and models.  The FAA assessed the current fleet based on mission, airframe age, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance history, as well as workforce composition and training to determine the recommended make-up of the future fleet.

The FAA contemplates a procurement for four (4) used Bombardier Challenger 605s or 650s via an Indefinite Delivery/Requirements contract to supplement the current fleet of Challenger 605 aircraft.   The FAA has determined that Bombardier Challenger 605/650 meet the the requirement.  This determination is based on the significant investment in operations (pilot) and maintenance training, parts, and tooling, as well as engineering data and support already in place for this airframe which allows the FAA to significantly modify the aircraft (including installation of components that require skin penetration) necessary to meet the FAA mission. The FAA plans to procure Bombardier Challengers over a two (2) year period based on availability of funding and market availability.  The FAA will modify the Challenger 605/650 aircraft to meet multiple FAA mission requirements.  

The requirements for the Bombardier Challenger 605s or 650s are included in Attachment A to this Market Survey. 

2.  MARKET SURVEY/RFI DISCUSSION TOPICS AND SUBMITTAL INFORMATION

Provide a description of your business to include company size (large, small, gross receipts, number of employees, etc.); nature of the business; small business designation, if applicable; years in business; and registered North American Industry Classifications (NAICS) codes, if applicable.

    2.  Provide a brief performance history that includes years of experience in aircraft acquisition and/or disposal.  Please include volume of transactions and the types of aircraft bought and/or sold by year.

    3.  Provide a capability statement that demonstrates your firms ability to meet the FAA requirements for procuring used Bombardier Challenger 605/650s, in accordance with the requirements identified in Attachment A.

    4.  Provide your projection for market availability of the Bombardier Challenger 605 and 650 over the FAAs timeline for procurement.  The FAA appreciates information on the advantages, disadvantages, capabilities, and significant differences between the 605 and the 650.

    5.  Please provide warranty provisions that could be considered for the used aircraft to include warranty on airframe, engines, and avionics.  Please indicate how modifications made by the FAA might impact the warranty. 

    6.  The FAA contemplates issuing fixed priced delivery orders to purchase aircraft at the rate of one or two per year.  Interested vendors are encouraged to provide feasibility based on projected market availability. 

    7.  Please include a description of your fees and fee structure for providing the airframes and available warranties.

<DESC>The Naval Information Warfare Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific), formerly SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-19- R-0037 engineering services to support the development and sustainment of Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) and other selected application hosting, monitoring, modernization, and replication systems/frameworks. NIAPS delivers maintenance, logistics, administrative, training, and management applications to users at sea. NIAPS is designed to maximize the use of limited bandwidth by providing afloat units with access to applications while disconnected from the internet. NIAPS ensures that data between ship and shore remains synchronized throughout the replication of data and applications hosted on NIAPS. NIAPS is a suite of applications and content, integrated together and hosted on a single shipboard server. It can be categorized as a shipboard intranet web-based information system used to support, collect, distribute, and display information in a shipboard environment. NIAPS hosts an intranet that maintains information such as: training courses, maintenance documents, data collection, and morale and welfare information. NIAPS provides content and information to the user during times that network access external to the ship is unavailable. NIAPS will be phased out in the FY20-24 timeframe and will be replaced by other services providing hosting, monitoring, and replication for afloat applications. These services will have to be developed, tested and supported on several different Navy networks. In addition, current Navy applications require modernization to take advantage of these new services.  This proposed single award indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) cost-plus-fixed- fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements is the result of the previous Seaport-E task order. These requirements are ongoing and are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. The anticipated period of performance is a 5-year ordering period. Orders will be placed pursuant to the ordering process at FAR 16.505(a).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 Engineering Services ((Except (a)  Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons)) and the Small Business Size Standard is $38,500,000. The Product Service Code (PSC) for this contract is J070 "Maintenance, Repair and Rebuilding Of Equipment: Automatic Data Processing Equipment, Software, Supplies and Support Equipment. The Facility Clearance Level will be Secret.  This requirement will be competed as a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  NIWC Pacific anticipates that the final RFP for N66001-19-R-0037 will be released around mid to late November.  The solicitation will only be available electronically. Electronic copies of the RFP may be obtained from the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil under NIWC "Open Solicitations."  Hard copy versions of the RFP and any subsequent amendments will not be available.  Firms are encouraged to review the website regularly for important solicitation information.  Disclaimer: This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.  If a competitive solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via SPAWAR E- Commerce, and interested parties must comply with that announcement.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.  This is not a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation, and this information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.

<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research and to gauge potential interest in this anticipated support program. The Government seeks information that will be used as part of an analysis to determine if responsible sources exist to designate this effort as a competitive acquisition. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 336413 which has a corresponding size standard of 1,250 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in responses from all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, HUBZone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. </span></p>
<p>This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the Government. Under this potential supply chain management contract, a contractor will carry out logistics functions for the MH-60 platform via a phased or customer focused approach. DLA Aviation at Richmond anticipates possible award, on a sole-source basis, of a contract for the acquisition of supply chain management support and logistics management, which may include supply support on a DLA direct basis, demand/planning forecasting, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage/warehousing, reliability improvements, and field customer service/engineering support of the MH-60 manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft and the associated MH-60 Bill of Materials (BOM) of DLA managed consumable parts to support United States Navy (USN), Army (USA), Marine Corps (USMC) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.</p>
<p>The overarching objectives of this acquisition are to: (1) decrease MH-60 repair delays due to outstanding consumable requirements; and (2) accelerate the Fleet Readiness Centers (FRC) Programmed Maintenance Interval (PMI) turnaround time through enhanced material availability and cross talk between Navy Repair of Repairable (ROR) contract repair and FRC concurrent repairs. In order to meet these objectives, the contractor must have the ability to drive changes into the weapons system configuration and, more importantly, understand, analyze, and assess the implications-both in terms of performance and operational usage-of any potential configuration change.</p>
<p>A Supplier Initiated Ordering (SIO) system is projected for use in meeting the aforementioned objectives. Monthly Lot Payments or Transactional SIO are contemplated at this time. Regardless of the SIO strategy selected, the Contractor will utilize DLA demand data as well as intelligence gathered with Contractor service representatives at the FRC to forecast future demands and identify buy requirements for DLA to ensure Fill Rate and Material Availability performance increases from baseline performance, and over the life of the contract. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies via DLA Direct terms/delivery points as directed within specified timeframes. The contractor shall be responsible for forecasting, acquiring, stocking, and fulfilling requirements via its commercial operation/facility utilized to meet contract requirements. In addition to filling material requirements, the contractor may be required to make recommendations for Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) along with being responsible for obsolescence management and mitigating Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMSMS) challenges for the MH-60 Bill of Materials (BOM).</p>
<p>A transition period will occur post award where the Contractor will ramp up its supply chain to meet performance requirements. Open DLA contracts will continue to deliver and the Contractor will have visibility of such pending assets in the Government supplied data. As this and overall supportability will vary for each item within the BOM, an integrated solution, dedicated program management team will be required to ensure fill rate and material availability performance improvements and zero degradation of support.</p>
<p>Performance metrics associated with this acquisition may be tied to local (FRC customers) and DLA (worldwide) material availability. Small business participation and reliability improvements are also potential metrics.</p>
<p>The contract will allow for an expansion of support based on developing and evolving MH-60 requirements from DLA and/or USN/USMC/USA or other customers.</p>
<p>Any entity interested/able to provide any of the required products but cannot provide the required supply chain management solution may be afforded an opportunity to partner with an interested prime contractor, or participate as a subcontractor. Please identify any anticipated teaming arrangements under the acquisition herein, along with a description of similar support and teaming arrangements offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>Entities seeking to become an approved source of supply for possible subcontracting opportunities under this acquisition should note that the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. Sources that are not approved for manufacture of these items must obtain source approval from the Government.</p>
<p>Please provide the following business information in your response: Company Name, Address, CAGE Code, Point of Contact, Phone, Email and web page URL if available. Also please describe what small business type or category you represent, if applicable.</p>
<p>Any responses to this Potential Sources Sought should include responses to the following:</p>
<p>1. Describe your experience executing relevant supply chain management programs. What do you envision as the risk areas associated with this effort and how would you mitigate those risks?</p>
<p>2. Is your interest in this effort as a prime or subcontractor?</p>
<p>3. Describe your capabilities in performing the supply chain functions: demand forecasting, supplier management, inventory management, warehousing, configuration management, obsolescence management, training, and sustaining engineering/maintaining reliability.</p>
<p>4. Describe the transition and implementation actions and timeframes your firm would identify/need to successfully execute the anticipated requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>5. For a FAR 15 acquisition effort as described herein for approximately 1,000 consumable items, what do you anticipate as a reasonable proposal turn-around time? This assumes a portion of items will exceed TINA thresholds and be subject to Cost or Pricing Data requirements. <br /><br />6. What quality control systems/measures do you currently have in place (ISO 9000, 9001, AS9100, NADCAP (National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program)?</p>
<p>7. Describe your experience with Government Source Inspection, Critical Safety Items, and OSHA standards.</p>
<p>8. How many employees are in your company?</p>
<p>9. Are you currently registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and Wide Area Workflow (WAWF)? Do you currently utilize Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) functionality? If so, what transaction sets? Do you currently have access to any Government systems, authorized for use in performance of another Government contract? If so, please explain.</p>
<p>10. What suggestions, if any, do you have for this potential supply chain management SIO effort (including evaluation criteria, CLIN structure, contract structure, incentive/disincentive structure and application, data requirements, or other elements)?</p>
<p>11. Do you possess all the necessary technical data to perform this potential contract?</p>
<p>12. Do you have electronic interface capability with military inventory control points?</p>
<p>13. Describe your experience with ECPs and obsolescence and modeling/simulation capabilities for the MH-60 platform? <br /><br />Disclaimer</p>

<SUBJECT>Participant Recruitment, Screening, and Remuneration at the NIDA IRP Clinical Program
<SOLNBR>75N95020R00007
<RESPDATE>111519
<ARCHDATE>12232019
<CONTACT>Joshua T. Lazarus, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014436677, Email josh.lazarus@nih.gov
<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the National Institute on Drug Abuse -Intramural Program (NIDA IRP), is seeking capability statements from <strong>BOTH Other than Small Business and Small Business</strong> organizations to provide the Government support for participant recruitment, screening, and remuneration at the NIDA IRP Clinical Program. <br /><br />This is a <strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</strong> to determine the availability of <strong>BOTH Other than Small Business and Small Businesses</strong> (e.g., 8(a), Veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned small businesses) with the capability to meet the objectives and requirements described below. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><br />The mission of NIDA IRP is to conduct state-of-the-art research on basic mechanisms that underlie substance use disorders (SUDs), and to develop new methods for the treatment of SUDs. Research is supported at the molecular, genetic, cellular, animal, and human clinical levels and is conceptually integrated, highly innovative strategies and techniques. The long-term goal of the research is to better understand the biological and behavioral factors contributing to initiation, maintenance, and elimination of SUDs (and associated diseases), and to translate this knowledge into improved strategies for prevention, treatment, and reduction of negative consequences for the individual and for society caused by substance use disorders. Using volunteer human participants, the IRP clinical program conducts residential and nonresidential research studies that interrelate with pre-clinical laboratory work. In general, these studies include assessment of drug-use patterns, investigation of underlying brain mechanisms, and testing of a variety of SUD behavioral or biomedical treatments.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</strong><br />The purpose of this <strong>Sources Sought Notice</strong> and <strong>market research</strong> is to identify vendors with demonstrated experience and capabilities in providing services for the recruitment, screening and remuneration of eligible research participants for inclusion in human research studies conducted by the NIDA IRP as part of their ongoing mission. NIDA IRP seeks to enroll a highly targeted and representative study population of sensitive/unique research participants including those with active SUDs (e.g. nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, opioids) who are not seeking treatment, those who are seeking treatment, people who are occasional users of these substances and healthy controls who match the other populations with respect to characteristics such as age, gender, socio-economic status (SES), IQ, etc. The NIDA IRP is also conducting studies requiring HIV-positive populations.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:</strong><br />A Capable Vendor must demonstrate its experience and ability to perform the following key requirements:</p>
<p><strong>I. Recruitment:<br /></strong><br /><strong>1.</strong> Develop, implement and manage custom advertising and recruitment strategies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.</strong> Most research at the IRP is done on-site at the Biomedical Research Center (BRC) at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus located in Baltimore, requiring repeated visits from participants who do not own vehicles. Therefore, capable Vendors must have the experience and ability to recruit large numbers of participants living within five to ten miles of the designated site location.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>b.</strong> Each individual research studies will require custom-developed and multi-pronged approaches to recruitment campaigns, therefore a capable Vendor must demonstrate its familiarity with NIDA IRP's target population (or research participants), as well as its ability to develop a tailored recruitment plan based on the specified inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria.<br /><strong><br />2.</strong> Establish grassroot community partnerships campaigns aimed at educating the local public on NIDA IRP's mission, building awareness, and establishing trust.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; a.</strong> A capable vendor shall demonstrate its expertise in identifying and establishing community relationships with organizations or foundations (e.g. faith-based organizations, community gathering places, and foundations providing support for those with SUDs, etc.) with connections to the various populations NIDA is seeking to identify and recruit.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>b.</strong> The overall goal of this effort is to educate the specific populations on who NIDA is, what research NIDA does, and to create a mutually beneficial relationship founded in trust with the local community. Reaching out to the community-based organizations as well as healthcare providers, local physicians and treatment centers will enhance research enrollment. <br /><strong><br />3.</strong> Manage targeted advertising campaigns that include the development and placement of multi-media advertisements.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.</strong> A capable vendor must demonstrate its experience in customizing targeted messages to a specific population based on varying Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. For the purpose of this requirement the populations could include but may not be limited to: individuals who are generally healthy but may also have substance use disorders; and/or individuals who do not have a substance use disorder but are otherwise closely matched (e.g. with regard to socioeconomic status (SES), IQ, race, ethnicity, etc.). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> b.</strong> A capable vendor should demonstrate its experience in developing and implementing multi-media advertising campaigns in the Baltimore/ Washington metropolitan area. Participants may also come from neighboring states (e.g. northern Virginia, southern Pennsylvania).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>c.</strong> Vendors should possess experience in developing creative initiatives and utilizing evidence-based statistics to develop recruitment strategies to target each population identified by NIDA as essential to meet recruitment goals and to overcome challenges to reach these populations. Target populations include but are not limited to individuals who smoke cigarettes (treatment seeking and non-treatment seeking), ex-smokers, and those with marijuana, opioid, cocaine or alcohol use disorders, not necessarily in combination with one another, who may or may not be seeking or are currently in treatment for a SUD. Some studies are also seeking to enroll HIV positive populations. While other studies may involve Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies or utilizing non-invasive brain stimulation techniques which require a highly selective I/E criteria. Many studies require participants who do not have dual SUDs, nor other comorbidities such as mental health disorders, or any significant physical illness. Given the diversity of the I/E criteria it is important to the science of the studies and recruitment targets must be reached within reasonable timeframes.<br /><br /><strong>4.</strong> Conduct real-time monitoring and continuous optimization of all recruitment strategies as well as establish tracking and performance metrics for each strategy and campaign.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.</strong> NIDA IRP requires each marketing strategy used (e.g. performance of each ad) to be tracked on an on-going, real time basis. Therefore, a capable vendor must demonstrate is ability to assess the effectiveness of each campaign and continuously monitor the resulting data in order to improve strategies and optimize recruitment goals per protocol.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>b.</strong> A capable vendor should have demonstrated experience in managing advertising campaigns through print, internet, community outreach, as well as other media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>II. Screening:<br /></strong><br /><strong>1.</strong> Conduct preliminary screening procedure by phone and online that are compliant with a variety of criteria and protocols based on the designated recruitment initiative.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.</strong> Phone screeners must have experience working with sensitive populations such as those with SUD and/or HIV, etc., and be familiar with empathetic, supportive and non-stigmatizing methods of communication. Screeners must also be familiar with each study and prepared to answer questions about the study such as purpose, timeline, and payment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; b.</strong> A capable vendor should demonstrate its experience in utilizing a structured computer-based screening process designed to capture relevant information from the aforementioned populations to assess basic inclusion/exclusion criteria and the candidate's current research interests. Screening results must be interpreted in the context of the current epidemiology and natural history of drug use, misuse, use disorders and treatment for appropriate referral to research opportunities. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>c.</strong> Phone screening must accommodate after-hours callers (i.e. evenings/weekends) and have the flexible ability to handle transient high call volume and include flexible time-frames to accommodate research candidate's availability and call fluctuations based on new campaign launches.<br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> Conduct in-person screening procedures that are compliant with a variety of criteria and protocols based on the designated recruitment initiative.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.</strong> The in-person screening process is a very critical element of this contract and our research operations. All study candidates must undergo a thorough onsite screening process. A small number of the studies permit portions of the screening process to be completed via secure online methods (e.g. Skype, FaceTime) with participants who are offsite. All screening procedures must be streamlined to optimize efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the process.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> b.</strong> In person screeners must be familiar with each study and be prepared to answer questions about the study such as purpose, timeline, and payment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>c.</strong> In person screeners are required to conduct basic medical assessments (e.g. obtaining vital signs, drawing blood, performing echocardiograms (ECGs), urine pregnancy testing, CO monitoring, breathalyzer and urine testing for drugs of abuse). Capable vendors will also be required to supply the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waiver testing kits needed for pregnancy, HIV and urine testing for drugs of abuse. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> d.</strong> At least one staff member would be required to be present at all times during onsite screening hours who is qualified to: assess the mental health of potential study participants to determine whether they can give informed consent, assess whether a potential volunteer meets The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria for mental and substance use disorders, and intervene should psychological distress occur during screening.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>e.</strong> The screening process also includes assessment of SUDs via administering medical and psychiatric measures, and psychiatric interviewing. Screeners should be familiar with and qualified to administer psychiatric measures (e.g. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID), Substance Use Disorder Evaluation (DSM-5)) and be prepared to obtain measure-specific training as needed. <br /><br /><strong>3.</strong> Provide schedule coordination services for those candidates that are accepted through the screening process.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.</strong> Vendors should have the capability to provide automated options for those respondents who click on digital ads/media and include digital (e.g. text) reminders and confirmations of scheduled appointment times.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>b.</strong> Digital (e.g. text) reminders and confirmations of scheduled appointment times must be offered to all candidates.</p>
<p><strong>III. Remuneration:<br /><br />1.</strong> Provide remuneration services to participants as they complete sections of a protocol.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a.</strong> Remuneration may be dispersed as cash, checks, gift cards, online payments or paying bills directly on behalf of the participant, as defined by the protocol. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>b.</strong> All expenses must be tracked in the participants' electronic medical record in addition to overall record keeping of all funds distributed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>c.</strong> Coordinate and track participant progress within each study, and account for all remuneration paid to participants through different forms of compensation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>d.</strong> Coordinate travel and subsistence program for participants requiring transportation and lodging, as needed and described in each protocol. This may include but not be limited to taxi, train, bus, or plane, as well as local hotel accommodations when required (in accordance with NIH policies).</p>
<p><strong>IV. Flexible Staffing:<br /><br />1.</strong> Support the effective communication and coordination of all requirements through regular reporting and the implementation of an automated system to track and generate specific performance reports, as well as maintain close communication with study staff to determine and optimize how participants who are interested and eligible for multiple studies will proceed through the recruitment process and into a study.<br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> Provide cross-trained staffing solutions with flexible and adaptive hours, (including evenings and weekends) capable of conducting screening services online, over the phone, or in-person.</p>

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), and constitutes only a sources sought for a potential solicitation. Naval Warfare Information Center, Pacific (NIWCPAC) is seeking small business firms with current relevant knowledge, experience and capability for procuring Build-to-Print C4ISR systems and ancillary kits, modules, and spares with associated as-built documentation.  NIWCPAC is responsible for basic research, end-to-end system design, prototype development, systems engineering, integration, production, software loading, pre-installation testing and checkout (PITCO), deployment, and life cycle support of Command, Control, Communications, Computer (C4), Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. Major programmatic and technical thrusts are directed toward merging advanced technology and a variety of Commercial-Off- The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the- Shelf (GOTS) hardware and software into various C4ISR system variants and configurations, primarily supporting joint C4ISR and Cybersecurity needs of the military. While most of this work addresses the Navys requirements, we actively support Marine Corps, Air Force, Army, and Coast Guard programs. Other government agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, frequently call on our C4ISR expertise.  The Product & Systems Production Branch, NIWCPAC Code 42150, specializes in rapid-design and integration of COTS/GOTS products for military applications, Environmental Qualification Testing (EQT) services and Limited/Full Rate Production (LRIP/FRP).  Technical requirements will fall into two primary focus areas of services, namely: (1) Production Services, and (2) Task Order management/administration.  The government shall define specific requirements in individual Task Orders (TOs).  The Contractor shall, in response to individual task orders awarded under this contract, provide services to deliver specific C4ISR systems with as-built documentation to the NIWC Pacific NIEF or designated alternative government facility.  A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and Market Survey (MS) for Service Procurements by the Government are attached to this Market Survey Notice.  The Governments estimated level of effort for this procurement, based upon Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) will be approximately 26.5 per year.  Each FTE is estimated to be 2,080 hours per year.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330  Engineering Services, and the small business size standard is $16.5M effective 19 August 2019.  Interested small business firms are invited to respond to this sources sought announcement by providing a Relevant Contract Experience Matrix (not to exceed 13 pages) that addresses the areas of emphasis in the attached Market Survey (MS) for Services Procurements.  The attached MS for Services Procurements sets forth the requirements for response submission.  A determination as to whether a potential acquisition will be a set-aside or full and open competition will be based upon responses to this notice.  Capability information is to be submitted via electronic transmission in the time specified within the MS.  NIWCPAC may not evaluate offeror submissions that do not comply with the submission instructions.  NIWCPAC will evaluate offeror submissions that comply with the submission instructions using the following criteria: breadth, depth and relevancy of experience as it relates to the work envisioned in the Draft SOW as further specified in the Governments attached MS for Services Procurements.  If insufficient responsive qualified 8(a) firms indicate interest, the Navy will review responsive qualified small business firms for issuance of a competitive small business set-aside solicitation.  If insufficient qualified small business firms indicate interest, the Navy may procure the services through unrestricted full and open competition. Each respondent to this notice will be notified in writing of the set-aside or unrestricted decision made for this procurement.  Please direct any questions and transmit capability information to the Contracts Specialist, Marianito J. Rosal at marianito.rosal@navy.mil.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOT AN RFP AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers New York District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:
<p>Gun Tube Heat Treat Furnace Replacement at the Watervliet Arsenal, NY</p>
<p>Project Description: This project will replace the existing SELAS Gun Tube Heat Treat Furnace located at Watervliet Arsenal. Included will be the removal of the existing SELAS furnace system; Filling of the existing quench pit under the existing SELAS furnace system, where required by the new design; Hazardous materials remediation of areas affected by the work of the Gun Tube Heat Treat Furnace Replacement; Design, construction, installation and commissioning of the new furnace system; Design and construction of furnace system foundations, pits and trenches; Design, modification and commissioning of supporting building systems; Commissioning of and training on the replacement furnace and supporting building systems.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Aggregate value of potential contracts is between $25,000,000 to $100,000,000.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Approximately 760 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur March 2020.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project.<br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described construction project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the East River Bridges project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles of the five New York City Boroughs) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?</p>
<p>g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc..</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Alyssa Tornatore, Contract Specialist at alyssa.tornatore@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 15 Nov 2019.</p>

Request for Information/Sources Sought #36A77620Q0008_1

**IMPORTANT: Please read this notice in full BEFORE responding! **

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is in the process of planning a requirement in which a contractor will be required to provide Ice Machine, Dispenser, Nugget as part of the initial outfitting of the newly constructed VA Clinic in Omaha, NE (see salient characteristics, and warranty specifications below).

The VA is conducting market research and is seeking written responses with information to assist with identifying potential sources that are interested in, and capable of, providing the products described. Please review the information contained herein and identify whether your company has the capability and interest to provide the brand name items listed or equivalent items that possess the salient characteristics as described. Please see section titled  SUBMITTAL OF RFI RESPONSE  below for what information to include in your company s response.

GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS

The VA is requesting vendors answer the following questions in response to this notice.

Are there any specifications for individual items that you believe may be too restrictive when taking into consideration industry standards (see draft Statement of Work)? What specifications and why?
Are there any accessories for any equipment item that are normally separately priced? What accessories?
Are there any items that you would recommend be purchased separately? What items and why?
Is there any reason you would not be interested in responding to a solicitation? What are the reason(s) and why?
What is the lead time on this equipment?
Does your company manufacture the items in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R.  125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States?
Do you have any questions or comments that may otherwise assist us?

SET-ASIDE

Complete responses to this notice will assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside for the requirement. Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.

AUTHORIZED DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR VERIFICATION

Gray market items are Original Equipment Manufacturer s (OEM) goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors. This procurement is for new OEM medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts) for VA Medical Centers. No remanufactures or gray market items will be acceptable.

Vendor shall be an OEM, authorized dealer, authorized distributor or authorized reseller for the proposed medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts), verified by an authorization letter or other documents from the OEM, such that the OEM s warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM. All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

The delivery of gray market items to the VA in the fulfillment of an order/award constitutes a breach of contract. Accordingly, the VA reserves the right enforce any of its contractual remedies. This includes termination of the contract or, solely at the VA s election, allowing the Vendor to replace, at no cost to the Government, any remanufactured or gray market item(s) delivered to a VA medical facility upon discovery of such items.

This requirement is for new equipment ONLY; remanufactured or  gray market  items will not be accepted.  Gray market,  also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.

Any vendor interested in this requirement shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized dealer or distributor for the proposed equipment/system such that OEM warranty and services are provided and maintained by the OEM or that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment on their behalf. All software licensing, warrant, and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

To assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside, we are requesting vendors provide the authorized dealer/distributor letter in response to this Request for Information (RFI).  Any future solicitation will include the requirement for vendors to provide authorized dealer verification for all items of equipment. To satisfy this requirement, the vendor shall provide the original documentation from the manufacturer stating they are an authorized dealer/distributor for the items being procured.  This letter shall be on the manufacturers  official letter head or from an official manufacturer  email and guarantees the products are safe, are not counterfeit or adulterated devices, have maintained adequate storage conditions, and that:

All product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or
Guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.

LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING AND THE NON-MANUFACTURER RULE (NMR)

The requirement that a non-manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R.  121.406]. In order to qualify as a small business concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R.  125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/ WARRANTY SPECIFICATIONS

See attached DRAFT Statement of Work (ATTACHMENT 1).

<DESC>This notice is issued for informational and planning purposes only. This announcement is neither a Request For Proposal (RFP) nor does it constitute a guarantee or otherwise commit the Government, in any way, to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. SPE4A2-17-R-0032 is the planned solicitation number and is being used for notice identification; however, no solicitation is available at this time.
<p>DLA Aviation intends to bundle approximately 1,398 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) into a procurement for H-53E performance based supply chain management support. This holistic project is expected to be a single contract action with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky). This population of items meets the definition of bundling at FAR 2.101, and it is likely to be unsuitable for award to a small business due to the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of the performance specified.</p>
<p>DLA Aviation has determined that measurably substantial benefits are expected to be derived as a result of the bundling as defined at FAR 7.107. The expected benefits of this bundling action are listed in FAR 7.107-3 and summarized below: <br />(1) Cost savings<br />(2) Price reduction<br />(3) Quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency<br />(4) Reduction in acquisition cycle times<br />(5) Better terms and conditions<br />(6) Anticipated financial benefits equivalent to ten (10) percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options)</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to invite interested parties to attend a Small Business Industry Day hosted by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation. The Small Business Industry Day presentation will explain the Government's rationale for this holistic project and highlight how small businesses can become qualified suppliers to Sikorsky. Sikorsky will provide a briefing that will cover their commitment to small business, what it is looking for in a supplier, small business NAICS codes, supplier-teaming resources, and the steps for supplier qualification. <br /><br />The Small Business Industry Day will be held at DLA Aviation (Defense Supply Center Richmond), Lotts Conference Center, located at 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway, Richmond, Virginia 23297 at 0900-1400 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on October 25, 2017.

<DESC>***REQUEST FOR INFORMATION***

***If you are viewing this announcement through any link other than FAA Contract Opportunities (FAACO) website (https://faaco.faa.gov), please visit this site to ensure that you are viewing the full announcement, amendments, attachments and instructions. Vendors are responsible for monitoring this website for updates to this announcement.***

Request for information (RFI) regarding methods and guidance for small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) mounted sensor technologies to supplement airport pavement inspections

Any confidential or proprietary information submitted in response to this announcement must be marked accordingly by the vendor.  Such information will not be disclosed outside of the acquisition team. 

The FAAs Airport Technology Research and Development Branch (ATRD) is currently conducting research on how to enable the safe, reliable, and effective integration of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) and sensor technologies into the airport environment to conduct airport pavement management program inspections. Airfield pavement inspection assists airports with finding optimum strategies for maintaining pavements in a safe serviceable condition over a given period for the least cost. This is especially important since approximately 70% of Airport Improvement Program grants allocated each year are invested in airfield pavements.  

There have been several attempts in recent years of companies and airport operators using sUAS to conduct various types of pavement imaging and inspections at airports.  These activities have included proof-of-concept demonstrations involving the use of various types of UAS platforms, sensors and procedures. To build off of these promising developments, ATRD plans to conduct research in cooperation with industry partners to develop procedures and technical specifications for UAS platform(s) and sensor(s) used to conduct sUAS airport pavement inspections.  

The FAA is requesting information on your organizations experience with conducting sUAS based pavement inspections. This includes, but is not limited to:  

sUAS platforms and mounted sensor technologies that your organization has tested for pavement inspections;  

locations where testing took place; 

what does your organization consider state-of-the-art sUAS platform/sensor technologies (using commercial off the shelf equipment) to conduct pavement inspections?

what does your organization see as potential emerging sUAS platform/sensor technologies for conducting pavement inspections; and recommendations with how to approach this research effort based on lessons learned from your testing?

This request is for information only. This is not a Call for White Papers or a Request For Proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this RFI. Therefore, any cost associated with this RFI is solely at the vendors expense.

This RFI closes November 15, 2019 at 5:00 PM EST

The MEDVAMC designated LifeGift as the OPO to provide organ donation and recovery services as may be appropriate to assure that all usable organs are obtained from potential donors.  Furthermore, LifeGift has been designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a Medicare-certified OPO to procure organs and tissues from organ or tissue donors who die in hospitals and to provide organs and tissue to hospitals that perform organ transplants.  Finally, LifeGift is the sole OPO dedicated to recovering organs and tissues for individuals needing transplants in 109 Texas counties in Southwest, North and West Texas; hospitals may not choose which OPO to work with.

Therefore, LifeGift is the sole OPO for the Michael E. DeBakey VAMC, as obligated by federal regulations.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<div><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO ISSUE A CONTRACT MODFIICATION WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) on behalf of NHLBI's Information Technology and Application Center (ITAC) intends to negotiate and issue a modification to procure an open market item under Contract/Task Order number GS-35F-0585J/HHSN268201600301U without providing for full and open competition (Including brand-name) to Unison Software, Inc., 21251 Ridgetop Circle, Dulles, VA, 20166.</p>
<p><br />NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 511210 with a Size Standard of $41,500,000.00.</p>
<p><br />REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures at an amount not exceeding the SAT.</p>
<p><br />STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b)(1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Background -</p>
<p>The NHLBI OA provides acquisition support for products and services that range from simplified acquisitions to the complex acquisition of research and development services, including clinical trials. Through the COAC, the OA serves the acquisition needs of five additional Institutes and Centers (ICs) at NIH:  National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR); and, the Center for Scientific Review (CSR).  In an effort to standardize the workflow for acquisitions, reduce workload, increase transparency of the acquisition process, and automate interfaces to other systems, in 2016, the OA procured and implemented a commercial-off-the-self (COTS) software owned by Unison Software, Inc., known as PRISM.</p>
<p>PRISM provides procurement automation support throughout the entire acquisition management lifecycle, from initial planning through award and closeout and was specifically developed to manage the complex governmental regulations, requirements, and compliance standards. PRISM provides the following benefits:	<br />&bull;	Ownership of all data<br />&bull;	Transparency across the lifecycle<br />&bull;	Full compliance with Federal mandates<br />&bull;	Ability to maintain a high level of responsiveness<br />&bull;	Web-based worldwide access<br />&bull;	Rapid deployment capability<br />&bull;	Ability to grow and evolve as new challenges emerge<br />The Unison PRISM software was procured from Unison Software Systems, Inc. on a limited source basis via the GSA Schedule IT-70 under Task Order GS-35F-0585J / HHSN268201600301U on September 30, 2016.  The period of performance is a base year with four (4) option years:</p>
<p>Base Period: September 30, 2016 - September 29, 2017<br />Option Period 1: September 30, 2017 - September 29, 2018<br />Option Period 2: September 30, 2018 - September 29, 2019<br />Option Period 3: September 30, 2019 - September 29, 2020<br />Option Period 4: September 30, 2020 - September 29, 2021</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to modify an existing task order (GS-35F-0585J / HHSN268201600301U) to  add the Data Validation Rule Builder Application, an open market product, to Option Period 3 to address an identified need for the tool as a result of the decommissioning of HHS Department Contracts Information System (DCIS).</p>
<p>HHS will be de-commissioning DCIS on 12/31/19 requiring agencies to report directly to the FPDS. The NIH Business System (NBS) will add HHS and NIH specific custom fields for FPDS reporting. These fields and validation logic are not currently reflected  in NHLBI's Contract Award &amp; Management System (CAMS). NHLBI needs a way to track and validate HHS and NIH specific fields that were in DCIS in CAMS. The Data Validation Rule Builder Application allows for Status Change Validation (SCV) to the PRISM application and adds validation logic to header custom fields which will facilitate accurate data reporting from CAMS to FPDS.</p>
<p>The Data Validation Rule Builder Application is an open market item and as such requires FAR 13 procuredures to be followed to incorporate into an existing GSA task order in accordance with FAR 8.402 (f).</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />November 15, 2019 through September 29, 2020<br /> <br />Project Description<br />The Data Validation Rule Builder Application allows for Status Change Validation (SCV) to the PRISM application and adds validation logic to header custom fields which will facilitate accurate data reporting from CAMS to FPDS.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations<br />None</p>
<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon FAR 13.106-1(b), and supported by the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research. In accordance with FAR Part 10, knowledgeable individuals in Government and industry were contacted regarding market capability to meet requirements. The market research indicates that no other COTS products integrate with the existing PRISM software to meet the Government's needs. Unison Software Inc. is the proprietary owner of the Data Validation Rule Builder Application, and Unison does not make its proprietary licenses available through third party resellers.</p>
<p><br />CLOSING STATEMENT<br />This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.

Companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide heavy ion beam time that meets the Government's requirement and certification requirements for beam time facility usage may respond.  Responses shall address the cyclotron facility requirements addressed in the SOW to include a heavy ion beam that can provide the required capability and beam characteristics needed for the series of research testing to be performed.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate, and an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the requirements set forth by the Trident Missile System program.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number:  N00164-20-S-NB09</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government's System for Award Management (SAM) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the attachments.  Offerors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.

It is the respondent's responsibility to monitor www.fbo.gov or www.grants.gov for the release of any further information.

<CONTACT>James Cheng, Contract Specialist, Phone 3016191012, Email james.cheng1.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This notice announces the intent by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to procure Freeze Dried Plasma (FDP) without competition as prescribed in FAR 6.302-1. Specifically, the Government will procure FDP from Teleflex, Inc.
<p>As described at FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), when the supplies or services required by the agency are available only from one responsible source, or for DoD, NASA and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other types of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.</p>
<p>There are no known suppliers for FDP in the United States at this time. Medical product developers within DoD (USAMRDC and USAMMDA) have committed considerable support to the research and development of a US sourced FDP product that has variable temperature stability, durable-packaging that can be easily stored, transported, and administered in remote conditions.</p>
<p>Under the terms of Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) 14-0420-CRA between USAMMDA and Teleflex Incorporated formerly known as Vascular Solutions, Teleflex Incorporated is responsible for product development and establishing manufacturing operations, including chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information to support the submission of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which was made in October 2016 ((IND) #17154 and Utility Patent Application Serial Number: US 15/399,643). USAMMDA has since sponsored, managed and funded all preclinical and clinical studies required to support a Biologic License Application (BLA) for commercialization. FDA approval is anticipated to be in Fiscal Year (FY) 20 and once that is received, Teleflex will be entitled to market EZPLAS Freeze-Dried Plasma, including sales to branches of the military and private sector medical providers.</p>
<p>Teleflex has developed a FDP product that is waiting for FDA-licensure. There are no other FDP products available. It has taken five years to get to this level of development since the project began. It is estimated that it would take up to another 7 years to develop a competing product that would meet the Government's requirement. This duplicate investment would not be recovered through competition. Due to the unique nature and lengthy development time for the FDP, no other entity can meet the Government's requirements for both the simulated and FDA licensed FDP by the required timeframe.</p>
<p>This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.102(a)(6) and 5.203(a). USAMRAA intends to publish a solicitation no sooner than 15 days after publishing this synopsis. This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the solicitation will be issued as brand name only.</p>
<p>All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to James Cheng at<br />james.cheng1.civ@mail.mil. Interested concerns must identify their capability in writing to the above email address listed above no later than 4:30 PM ET, 16 November 2019.</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(a) The Government recognizes that the line items established in this solicitation may not conform to the Offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in acceptance of deliverables and processing payments. Therefore, the Offeror is invited to propose alternative line items for which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Offeror.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(b) The Offeror may submit one or more additional proposals with alternative line items, provided that alternative line items are consistent with subpart 4.10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. However, acceptance of an alternative proposal is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the Government. Offers that do not comply with the line items specified in this solicitation may be determined to be nonresponsive or unacceptable.</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(8) The Contractor shall furnish to the contracting agency all information required by Executive Order11246, as amended, and by the rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor. The Contractor shall also file Standard Form100 (EEO-1), or any successor form, as prescribed in 41 CFR Part60-1. Unless the Contractor has filed within the 12 months preceding the date of contract award, the Contractor shall, within 30 days after contract award, apply to either the regional Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) or the local office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for the necessary forms.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(9) The Contractor shall permit access to its premises, during normal business hours, by the contracting agency or the OFCCP for the purpose of conducting on-site compliance evaluations and complaint investigations. The Contractor shall permit the Government to inspect and copy any books, accounts, records (including computerized records), and other material that may be relevant to the matter under investigation and pertinent to compliance with Executive Order11246, as amended, and rules and regulations that implement the Executive Order.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(10) If the OFCCP determines that the Contractor is not in compliance with this clause or any rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, this contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part and the Contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts, under the procedures authorized in Executive Order11246, as amended. In addition, sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the Contractor as provided in Executive Order11246, as amended; in the rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor; or as otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(11) The Contractor shall include the terms and conditions of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that is not exempted by the rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued under Executive Order11246, as amended, so that these terms and conditions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(12) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the Director of OFCCP may direct as a means of enforcing these terms and conditions, including sanctions for noncompliance, provided, that if the Contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of any direction, the Contractor may request the United States to enter into the litigation to protect the interests of the United States.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(d) Notwithstanding any other clause in this contract, disputes relative to this clause will be governed by the procedures in 41 CFR 60-1.</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(2) [_]Have, [_]have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>As prescribed in 19.309(c), insert the following clause:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Jul 2013)</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is not dominant in its field of operation when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(3) For long-term contracts-</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Contractor represents that it [_X_] is, [_] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code __611699__ assigned to contract number ____.</p>

<p>Manufacturer: HoneyCommCore, LLC</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source Only: <br />HoneyCommCore LLC is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the Core Stretcher (Honeycomb Expander). Government personnel traveled to another depot maintenance center, OC-ALC, to witness the operation of this core stretcher on similar aircraft parts. This equipment proved to process all like parts efficiently and in a timely manner. WR-ALC has been able to benchmark off of OC-ALC thereby reducing the time and money to integrate this specific core stretcher into WR-ALC 402 CMXG processes. If the Government purchases another core stretcher from a different company it will duplicate time and money to ensure a new piece of equipment can be used on similar parts. There are very limited sources for aluminum honeycomb core stretchers.<br /><br />Production is currently experiencing work stoppages and multiple constraints because CMXG does not have this equipment on hand. There is an urgent need for the core stretcher to prevent daily work stoppages on C-5, F-15, and C-17 aircraft systems at Robins AFB. Currently there are approximately 53 spoiler jobs that require core to some level and the Government has 6 sheets of core with 6 more due in soon. This leaves us with 41 spoilers that need core. With no expanded honeycomb core, the four mechanics will be unable to produce for 35 weeks. If honeycomb core is purchased before expansion, it takes 5 to 7 days for delivery. The core stretcher is urgently needed to achieve the seven day delivery time. Due to the above, HoneyCommCore LLC has the only equipment to satisfy the Government's requirements and schedule. The core stretcher is made to order - not pre-built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Exam Gloves, Chemotherapy. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Exam Gloves, Chemotherapy products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Exam Gloves, Chemotherapy in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Exam Gloves, Chemotherapy will be established approximately&nbsp;16 February 2020&nbsp;and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately 16 March 2020, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Exam Gloves, Chemotherapy. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Exam Gloves, Chemotherapy.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, <a href="mailto:donna.raday@dla.mil">donna.raday@dla.mil</a>, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Exam Gloves, Chemotherapy. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $327,980. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eight items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 92.93% ($304,816) of the total volume in sales ($327,980). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3.

Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p>1330-52.237-71 Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.

<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.<br />b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a)	Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull;	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull;	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull;	The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b)	Requirements.</p>
<p>1.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2.	The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3.	If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i.	Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii.	The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4.	The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within          business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.</p>
<p>Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i.	The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii.	The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii.	NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.<br />iv.	Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5.	The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.</p>
<p>(c)	Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee.<br />All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&bull;	Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&bull;	Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org<br />&bull;	Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&bull;	Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d)	Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e)	Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1.	Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2.	Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3.	Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4.	Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract;<br />5.	Suspension or debarment; or<br />6.	Other appropriate action.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract language)</p>

In case any material or workmanship furnished by the contractor is found to be defective prior to redelivery of the vessel, or not in accordance with the requirements of the contract, the Government shall have the right prior to redelivery of the vessel to reject such material or workmanship, and to require its correction or replacement by the contractor at the contractor's cost and expense. This Government right is in addition to its rights under any Guarantee clause in this contract. If the contractor fails to proceed promptly with the replacement or correction of such material or workmanship, as required by the Contracting Officer, the Government may, by contract or otherwise, replace or correct such material or workmanship and charge to the contractor the excess cost to the Government. The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the work specified in the contract. Records of all inspection work by the contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of two (2) years after delivery of the vessel to the Government.<br />(d) No welding, including tack welding and brazing, shall be permitted in connection with repairs, completions, alterations, or addition to hulls, machinery or components of vessels unless the welder is, at the time, qualified to the standards established by the U.S. Coast Guard, the American Bureau of Shipping, or the Department of the Navy. The welder's qualifications shall be appropriate for the particular service application, filler material type, position of welding, and welding process involved in the work being undertaken. A welder may be required to re-qualify if the Contracting Officer believes there is a reasonable doubt concerning the welder's ability. Welders' qualifications for this purpose shall be governed by the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F). When a welding process other than manual shielded arc is proposed or required, the contractor or fabricator shall submit procedure qualification tests for approval prior to production welding. Procedure qualification tests shall be conducted in accordance with the United States Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F).<br />(e) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care to protect the vessel from fire, and the contractor shall maintain a reasonable system of inspection over the activities of welders, burners, riveters, painters, plumbers and similar workers, particularly where such activities are undertaken in the vicinity of the vessel's fuel oil tanks, magazines or storerooms containing flammable material. A reasonable number of hose lines shall be maintained by the contractor ready for immediate use on the vessel at all times while the vessel is berthed alongside the contractor's pier or in dry dock or on a marine railway. All tanks or bilge areas under alteration or repair shall be cleaned, washed, and steamed out or otherwise made safe by the contractor if and to the extent necessary as required by good marine practice or by current Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations.

Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contractor shall at all times maintain a reasonable fire watch about the vessel, including a fire watch on the vessel while work is being performed thereon.<br />(f) The contractor shall place proper safeguards and/or effect such safety precautions as necessary, including suitable and sufficient lighting, for the prevention of accidents or injury to persons or property during the prosecution of work under this contract and/or from time of receipt of the vessel until acceptance by the Government of the work performed.<br />(g) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, when the vessel is in the custody of the contractor or in dry dock or on a marine railway and the temperature becomes as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the contractor shall keep all pipelines, fixtures, traps, tanks, and other receptacles on the vessel drained to avoid damage from freezing, or if this is not practicable, the vessel shall be kept heated to prevent such damage. The vessel's stern tube and propeller hubs shall be protected from frost damage by applied heat through the use of a salamander or other proper means, as approved by the COR.<br />(h) Whenever practicable, the work shall be performed in a manner which does not interfere with the berthing and messing of personnel attached to the vessel. The contractor shall ensure that assigned personnel have access to the vessel at all times. It is understood that such personnel will not interfere with the work or the contractor's workers.<br />(i) The Government does not guarantee the correctness of the dimensions, sizes, and shapes shown in any sketches, drawings, plans or specifications prepared or furnished by the Government. Prior to submitting an offer, it is the responsibility of the bidder/offeror to verify the dimensions, sizes, and shapes in materials provided by the Government. Where practical, the Government will make the vessel available for inspection prior to bid opening or the date for receipt of proposals. If the contractor, as a result of inspection or otherwise, discovers any error in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications, it shall immediately inform the Contracting Officer of the error and proceed in accord with instructions received from the Contracting Officer. The Government is not liable for any claims or charges resulting from additional work performed by the contractor as a result of a patent ambiguity in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications that was not brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall be responsible for the correctness of the shape, sizes and dimensions of parts furnished by the contractor under the contract.<br />(j) The contractor shall at all times keep the site of the work on the vessel free from accumulation of waste material or rubbish caused by contractor employees or the work, and at the completion of the work shall remove all rubbish from and about the site of the work and shall leave the work and its immediate vicinity "broom-clean" unless more exactly specified in this contract.<br />(k) While in drydock or on a marine railway, the contractor shall be responsible for the closing, before the end of working hours, of all valves and openings upon which work is being done by its workers when such closing is practicable. The contractor shall establish a list and keep the COR cognizant of the closure status of all valves and openings upon which the contractor's workers have been working.<br />(l) Without additional expense to the Government, the contractor shall employ specialty subcontractors where required by the specifications or when necessary for satisfactory performance of the work.<br />(m)(1) Unless otherwise stated in the contract, the contractor shall notify the COR at least 72 hours in advance:<br />(i) Prior to starting inspections or tests; and<br />(ii) When supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) Such notification shall be provided either verbally or in writing at the discretion of the COR. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-71 - Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)<br />(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include:<br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and,<br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer ;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made.<br />(e) Mail the original invoice to:<br />NOAA Marine Operations Center - Pacific<br />Joel Heisler, Contracting Officer<br />2002 SE Marine Science Drive<br />Newport, Oregon 97365<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: "THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE-UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER ________."

<p>1352.271-72 - Additional Item Requirements (Air)-Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes-Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule:<br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance.<br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:<br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging.<br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals:<br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided.<br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer.<br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.

However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00.

Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.<br />(d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause.

The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, however, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work.

<SUBJECT>Advanced Wireless Services-3 (AWS-3) 2025-2110 Megahertz (MHz) Spectrum Management/Coordination System (SMCS)
<SOLNBR>HC104719R0010
<RESPDATE>120219
<ARCHDATE>12172019
<CONTACT>Franky Awuvey, Contract Specialist, Phone 3012254519, Email franky.m.awuvey.civ@mail.mil - Jhoonku Jee, Contract Specialist, Phone 3012254166, Email jhoonku.jee.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This effort is required to support the spectrum management and coordination of the 2025-2110 MHz band as a result of the third Advanced Wireless Services (AWS-3) auction.  In March 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in collaboration with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), developed rules for the auction and reallocation of the 1695-1710 MHz and 1755-1780 MHz radio frequency bands, which at that time were allocated exclusively for Federal use.  Between November 2014 and January 2015, the FCC conducted the third Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) auction ("Auction 97") to establish new AWS licenses in the 1695-1710 MHz, 1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz bands.  For reference, AWS-3 Transition information can be found at the following website: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/aws-3-transition.
<div><br />The Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) is responsible for providing common Department of Defense (DoD) services including the overarching capabilities and analyses required to implement the DoD's Transition Plans. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) - DSO Transition Plan includes six tasks:  <br />&bull;	DISA1:  1755-1780 MHz Early Entry Portal <br />&bull;	DISA2:  1755-1780 MHz Federal Spectrum Management System Portal<br />&bull;	DISA3:  1780-1850 MHz Compression and Optimization Tool<br />&bull;	DISA4:  2025-2110 MHz Spectrum Management/Coordination System <br />&bull;	DISA5:  1755-1780 MHz Spectrum Sharing Test &amp; Demonstration Program<br />&bull;	DISA6:  DoD Spectrum Relocation Management Team (DSRMT)<br /><br /></div>
<div>The DSRMT oversees DSO activities being conducted under the DISA Transition Plan, including oversight of contracted work.</div>
<div><br />Under the DISA4 activities, and as part of the AWS-3 transition, selected DoD system operations are targeted to gain access to the 2025-2110 MHz band and operate on a co-primary status on a non-interference basis with incumbent Television Broadcast Auxiliary Service (BAS), the Cable Television Relay Service (CARS), and the Local Television Transmission Service (LTTS) operations.  The SMCS will be used to facilitate spectrum sharing between the incumbent licensees' operations, and the transitioning DoD system operations.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />This effort will be a new start; however, the DSO has been conducting DISA4 planning with various stakeholders, to include the BAS and the office of the DoD Chief Information Officer.  DSO has conducted multiple transition planning exercises and has enlisted contractor support for these planning activities under the T4140 - "2025-2110MHz Coordination and Collaboration Support" contract.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The primary objective of the SMCS Development, is to provide an integrated system-of-systems that automates an end-to-end workflow for coordinating spectrum access between DoD system operations and incumbent Television BAS, CARS, and LTTS operations (hereafter referred to as Electronic News Gathering (ENG) operations).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The contractor shall apply an advanced working knowledge of spectrum engineering, spectrum requirements, data management, and business process workflow development to manage SMCS development, deployment, operations, maintenance, and continual enhancement services.  The contractor shall manage the software development lifecycle, delivery and deployment of the initial SMCS capability, and continually enhance the SMCS.  It is envisioned that the spectrum sharing of the 2025-2110 MHz will include a wide range of sharing scenarios, including cases where DoD access has been pre-coordinated with the ENG community, and cases where active coordination between DoD and the ENG community will be required.  SMCS shall be able to facilitate these various sharing scenarios.  The contractor shall implement industry standard agile development methodologies to develop and deliver the initial operational release of the SMCS, continuing to develop and deliver additional features and automation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Questions should be addressed to franky.m.awuvey.civ@mail.mil and jhoonku.jee.civ@mail.mil. Please provide any questions, in writing, no later than November 12, 2019 at 2:00pm (EST).  The Government reserves the right to not answer questions submitted after this time.</div>
<div><br /> Proposals are due no later than December 2, 2019 at 2:00pm (EST) and should be submitted to the following email addresses: franky.m.awuvey.civ@mail.mil and jhoonku.jee.civ@mail.mil.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This procurement is a 100% small business set aside in accordance with FAR Part 19.5 with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 333613, and an applicable size standard of 750 employees.
<p>A. The provision at FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial) applies to this acquisition.  See the addenda below titled, "Instructions to Offerors".<br />B.

<p>Submittals; <br />It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to make a determination of your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance and price. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>
<p>(1)	Technical Acceptability - to be determined technically acceptably offerors shall submit for evaluation, documentation of their capability to provide the specified services in accordance with the product description, including but not limited to, the capability to provide the supply specified, and in accordance with the specified delivery schedule.</p>

<p>The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.</p>

<p>(3) Price - Price quotes will be examined to determine the extent to which proposed prices are comparable with the Government estimates, and previous procurement history and a determination made of Price Reasonableness. The Government may reject any quote that is determined to be Not Fair and Reasonable, unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the requirements. All quotes will be evaluated and a determination made of lowest price, from prices presented on the Bidding Schedule, based on the Total of all line items.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong>
<div>Vietnam Electricity Contact: Ms. Luong Thi An, Deputy Director, International Relation Department, Vietnam Electricity (EVN), 11 Cua Bac Street, Ba Dinh District, Hanoi, Vietnam | Email: anlt@evn.com.vn</div>
<p>Proposals should be delivered to:  EVNPECC2, Ms. Bui Hai Yen, PECC2, 16th Floor, Sai Gon Giai Phong Building, 432-438 Nguyen Thi Minh Khai Street, Ward 5, District 3, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam, Telephone: +84 936 350 912</p>
<p>Southern Vietnam LNG Terminal and Gas-to-Power Project: Vietnam Electricity ("Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for the Grantee to develop a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal to support gas-to-power needs in Southern Vietnam.  The planned terminal would supply the fuel needs of the next generation of power centers in Southern Vietnam, and provide backup fuel supply of LNG to existing power plants.</p>
<p>EVN is the state-owned power company and the third largest company in Vietnam and has a total installed power generation capacity of over 28,000 MW (about 58%) till the end of 2018.  The company's core business is diversified throughout the energy sector, including production, transmission, distribution and trading of electricity; investment and capital management in power projects; and management, operation, repair, maintenance and upgrading of infrastructure throughout the power sector.  It carries out its business through EVN and its main subsidiary company groups:  three (3) Power Generation Corporations, five (5) Power Distribution Corporations, and the National Power Transmission Corporation.  EVN continues to make significant investments in generation as the demand for power in Vietnam is increasing at a rate of nearly 10 percent per annum.</p>
<p>In March 2016, the Vietnamese government published revisions to the 7th National Master Plan for Power Development for 2011-2020 (PDP7) for Vietnam.  The revised PDP7 sets out a blueprint for expanding power generation in Vietnam by using a mix of energy sources, with total installed capacity rising dramatically to about 129.5 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 (from 48.5 GW till the end of 2018).  Natural gas-fired power generation comprises approximately 15 percent of this planned power mix.  In response to revised PDP7, EVN is planning the development of a LNG terminal in southern Vietnam-including marine port, LNG storage, regasification, and related infrastructure- to supply the fuel needs of the next generation of power centers in southern Vietnam, and provide backup fuel supply of LNG to existing power plants (the "Project")..  It is anticipated that the LNG terminal, storage facilities and regasification trains would be developed in a phased approach, to match the country's power plant build out and gas demand.  However, the use of LNG and its importation is new to Vietnam.  As such, EVN requires a detailed feasibility study to conduct site selection for an LNG terminal and help to determine the optimal terminal design and regasification technology layout, in addition to economic and financial analyses, and a focused global LNG market analysis.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $1,494,020 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</span></strong></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.   Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.  Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.   Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.   Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">11:00 AM (local time), December 4, 2019</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) South and East Africa Regional Team, reports to the OTI Field Programs Division (FPD) Regional Team Lead or designee, and is based in Ethiopia.  The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be leadership, development, oversight, and management of DCHA/OTI's Ethiopia country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to U.S. Embassy colleagues, Ethiopian government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, and local government officials.</p>
<p>The OTI Ethiopia program supports the USG's larger objective of helping Ethiopia succeed as a secure, prosperous, and democratic country. In close coordination with U.S. Embassy colleagues and other USG actors, the OTI Ethiopia program will seek to empower and build the capacity of communities in Ethiopia to manage conflict and change. OTI's rapid and targeted programming addresses emerging issues and empowers local partners to leverage timely and locally driven activities that enhance engagement between government and citizens to promote democratic processes.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of an operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, D.C. and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington, D.C.-based DCHA/OTI South East Africa Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, the Country Representative - Ethiopia will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&#9679;	Manage a high-profile program in a dynamic environment and provide programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, U.S. Embassy, host country government, and local civil society officials based on political analysis and USG policy.</p>
<p>&#9679;	Communicate and coordinate OTI's in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, USAID, the U.S. Embassy and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Design and review staffing plans to meet overall program objectives as well as recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner <br />staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Analyze and report on current political developments, security concerns, and other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Provide recommendations to the Washington, D.C.-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&#9679;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, as well as monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Ensure that OTI's programs and activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned are applied to ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, United Nations (UN) Organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other pertinent organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential local partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, and contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy regional security officer and other organizations such as the UN or host government;</p>
<p>&#9679;	Articulate program strategy, as well as communicate and coordinate OTI's in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, USAID, and other donor organizations; prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and periodic reports to the USAID Mission, OTI/Washington, D.C. and other organizations as appropriate.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will be supervised by the Washington, D.C.- based DCHA/OTI FPD regional team leader for South and East Africa or his/her designee. The Country Representative will also report to the USAID/Ethiopia mission director or his/her designee. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington, D.C. leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The incumbent will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The incumbent's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives, influence on the overall program, or contribution to the advancement of the objective.</p>
<p>10.	AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizenship</p>
<p>11. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Ethiopia, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.

<p><br />AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>
<p>Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 7. <br />USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR)</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

<DESC><div>This is the second update on 01 Nov 2019 to this Solicitation/Request for Proposal (RFP). Earlier today this Solicitation/RFP was canceled in an attempt to reissue the Solicitation/RFP with working links to the Model Contract attachment.&nbsp; The reasoning for this is noted in the first update above, having to do with issues faced within FBO.gov on the original posting date of 30 Oct 2019 and inability to open the Model Contract attachment. Because of the restraints within FBO.gov, the Contracting Office was not/is not able to repost with the same RFP number of "FA9300-19-R-0003."&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Therefore, BE ADVISED that the actual Solicitation/RFP (to include the Model Contract attachment) can <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOW BE FOUND </span></em></strong>using the updated RFP number within FBO.gov of "<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FA9300-19-R-0003-Use</span></em></strong>" (please note dashes and capitalization are required as specified).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The new Solicitation/RFP posted today using RFP #FA9300-19-R-0003-Use is considered the Solicitation/RFP of record for the LAREDO acquisition. Any links or attachments posted with this original 30 Oct 2019 FBO.gov posting SHOULD NOT BE USED BY OFFERORS OR INTERESTED PARTIES for preparing their proposals.&nbsp; <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please see RFP #FA9300-19-R-0003-Use and the information contained within it for proposal preperation and information on the LAREDO Solicitation/RFP.&nbsp;</span></em></strong> &nbsp;</div>

<DESC>The National Park Service, under the approval and support of the Office of Management and Administration and the Office of the Comptroller, is providing a national Administrative Officer training. This training seeks to bring our Administrative Officer staff together and provide comprehensive training and review to the Administrative Officer team. Specifically, this training seeks more than 400+ current NPS staff who serve in the Administrative Officer role to attend and participate in this training. We are seeking to engage a centrally located, accessible hotel vendor in the southwest region, within the area of Albuquerque and Santa Fe, New Mexico, to provide meeting room space and audio/visual support to this Administrative Officer training. This Administrative Officer training will offer large training sessions for all participants as well as specific training tracks that will allow each participant to tailor their specific training needs to the training sessions being offered.

<p>(xi) Basis for Award: This is a lowest priced technically acceptable competition. The Government will select the lowest priced Offeror and evaluate that for technical acceptability.

In this way, it is possible that not all quotes submitted will be evaluated. The Government reserves the right not enter into clarifications sessions with the Offeror being evaluated.</p>
<p>Quote Contents: The Government will evaluate the submitted quote using a lowest-priced technically acceptable method as follows:</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability: The Government shall select the lowest priced offeror and evaluate that for technical acceptability. If it is found to be technically acceptable no other offers shall be evaluated. If the lowest-priced offer is found to be technically unacceptable, the Government shall evaluate the second-lowest priced offer. Etc. In this way it is possible that not all quotes submitted shall be evaluated.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to determine whether your company is technically acceptable, your quote shall have to include additional information (such as any other documentation your company feels will be helpful in ensuring they are technical acceptable).</p>
<p>Responsibility Determination: In order to be considered acceptable, your company must be listed in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov). Those who provide quotes but are not listed in the System for Award Management shall be considered technically unacceptable and not eligible for award. Please provide your DUNS number in your quote so the Government can confirm your entry in the System for Award Management (as well as other systems [if used, as this shall be optional by the discretion of the Government] such as CPARS to check responsibility). If your company cannot be determined to be responsible then you may not be eligible for award.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIAL NOTICE: 1 NOVEMBER 2019</span></strong>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This Special Notice is intended to:</p>
<p>- Inform responsible U.S. DOD Contractors interested in the NCRC EPOS business opportunity that NCRC EPOS draft documents and Industry Day Presentations are available and may be requested in accordance with the instructions provided herein;</p>
<p>- Express the Government's intent to release additional draft documents with emphasis the tentative date provided herein is subject to change and the information is intended to be used by Industry for pre-planning purposes only;</p>
<p>- Remind Industry the Government continues to seek pre-solicitation feedback from responsible and eligible U.S. DoD Contractors interested in the NCRC EPOS business opportunity; and,</p>
<p>- Emphasize the upcoming transition from FBO.gov to beta.SAM.gov.</p>
<p><strong>NCRC EPOS DRAFT DOCUMENTS:</strong></p>
<p>Revisions to previously released NCRC EPOS draft documents are available for review by Industry and posted herein with copies of the slide decks presented during the NCRC EPOS Industry Day conducted on 23 October 2019.</p>
<p><strong>NCRC EPOS DOCUMENT DISEMINATION PROCESS:</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with DODI 5230.24, Export-controlled items marked Distribution Statement C shall not be disseminated outside the U.S. Government or to U.S. DoD Contractors without first verifying the recipient's eligibility and authority to receive export-controlled information by ensuring they have a current, valid DD Form 2345. Therefore, U.S. DoD Contractors that would like to receive a copy of the NCRC EPOS draft documents shall submit a current certified DD Form 2345 to Mr. Robert D. Baird, Contract Specialist, via email at robert.d.baird10.civ@mail.mil.<br /><br />The Contract Specialist will provide U.S. DoD Contractors with a NCRC EPOS Distribution Agreement after verifying the validity of the DD Form 2345. Each U.S. DoD Contractors must return the completed Distribution Agreement to the Contract Specialist via email to complete the document eligibility and release process.</p>
<p>A vetting process will be used by the Procuring Contracting Officer and the Project Manager's designated representative to review Distribution Agreement submissions and authorize release of the NCRC EPOS draft documents. The U.S. Government reserves the right to withhold distribution of the Export Controlled documents to any respondent to this notice that is not eligible to receive unclassified technical data that is under the control of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).</p>
<p>U.S. DoD Contractors authorized to receive the NCRC EPOS documents marked Distribution Statement C will be provided a signed copy of the approved NCRC EPOS Distribution Agreement via e-mail from the Contract Specialist. The Contract Specialist will select the Data Custodian named on the U.S. DoD Contractor's DD Form 2345 as an authorized vendor. The U.S. DoD Contractors authorized Data Custodian must logon to their FBO.gov/beta.SAM.gov account to download the documents marked Distribution Statement C that are posted in locked packages.<br /><br />U.S. DoD Contractors may not redistribute documents marked Distribution Statement C without first providing the Contract Specialist the intended recipient's current DD Form 2345 that has been approved by DLA JCP. Written concurrence must be received from the U.S. Government prior to redistribution and a copy of the approved NCRC EPOS Distribution Agreement must flow down/accompany the NCRC EPOS documents when distributed by one contractor to another contractor at any tier/level.</p>
<p>The unauthorized release of Export Controlled technical data is a serious matter and U.S. DoD Contractor Data Custodians must exercise management controls for the dissemination and storage of documents marked Distribution Statement C at all levels. When in doubt contact the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer for guidance.</p>
<p><strong>FUTURE RELEASES OF NCRC EPOS DOCUMENTS:</strong></p>
<p>Updated versions of NCRC EPOS documentation may become available at a later date. For example, the U.S. Government anticipates release of additional documents on 7 November 2019 and the solicitation/RFP on 6 December 2019.</p>
<p><strong>INDUSTRY FEEDBACK:</strong></p>
<p>In partnership with TRMC, ACC-ORL and PEO STRI/PM CT2 continue to seek pre-solicitation feedback from responsible and eligible U.S. DoD Contractors interested in the NCRC EPOS business opportunity.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit questions/comments: a comment review matrix (CRM) spreadsheet will be provided with the NCRC EPOS draft documents. For continuity sake, please use the CRM to document questions/concerns. Material samples will not be accepted. Information papers will not be accepted. Any document that is submitted and not accepted will be returned to the U.S. DoD Contractor.</p>
<p>It is imperative that business concerns responding to this notice articulate their feedback clearly and adequately. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary information in any resultant RFP.<br /><br />When submitting a completed CRM, it must be password protected and routed to the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer identified in this announcement W900KK-20-R-0011 via e-mail. Send the password in an e-mail separate from the CRM.</p>
<p>NOTE: When a CRM contains extracts, or makes reference to Export Controlled Technical Data it may not be transmitted via e-mail. Use DOD SAFE (https://safe.apps.mil/). Non-DoD Personal Identity Verification (PIV) certificates or External Certificate Authority (ECA) are not currently supported. Users should select their SIGNATURE certificate issued through the DoD email Certificate Authority (CA) or select the AUTHENTICATION PIV certificate issued by the DOD Identifier (ID) Certificate Authority (CA) in order to connect. Contact the Contract Specialist via e-mail for alternate submission instructions before the deadline if DOD SAFE connectivity is not possible.</p>
<p>All responses to this notice received prior to 3:30 pm Eastern on 15 November 2019 will be reviewed.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government is not obligated to respond to questions/comments, or other respondent information, with feedback and/or evaluation information regarding the respondent's individual statements.</p>
<p><strong>FBO MOVE TO BETA.SAM.GOV</strong></p>
<p>Starting on 8 November 2019 FBO is transitioning to beta.SAM.gov. The Government anticipates completion of a seamless transition by 12 November 2019. SAVE THE DATE: The next release of NCRC EPOS documents is slated for 7 November 2019. Additional information concerning the transition is available beta.SAM.gov and the transition is available at FBO.gov.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited: 25-50, and 51-76.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is issuing this solicitation for the Consolidated Program Support Services (CPSS) Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)&nbsp;acquisition activity. The CPSS acquisition includes three separate Source Evaluation Boards (SEBs) for the following disciplines:</p>
<p>Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)<br />Project Coordination (PC)<br />Configuration and Data Management (CDM)</p>
<p>This posting includes the&nbsp;Final Request for Proposal (RFP) Amendment P00003&nbsp;for CPSS PP&amp;C.&nbsp;The period for questions or comments relative to this acquisition has closed. At this time, the Government is no longer accepting additional questions or comments in relation to the solicitation.</p>
<p>This solicitation is for the CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition which is the follow-on competition for the existing Marshall Integrated Program Support Services (MIPSS) PP&amp;C task order and MIPSS Programmatic Subject Matter Expert (SME) task order.</p>
<p>CPSS PP&amp;C includes PP&amp;C integration, Earned Value Management (EVM), cost estimating, cost analysis, and scheduling. The PP&amp;C integration discipline includes programmatic services supporting managers and decision makers for all aspects of program performance including planning, budgeting, scheduling, cost control, EVM, full cost accounting and budgeting implementation, workforce tracking and analysis, and risk management. The EVM discipline provides support in the area of EVM processes, analyses, and assessments including the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) process per the NASA IBR Handbook, and surveillance and compliance activities per Electronic Industries Alliance EIA-748, Earned Value Management Systems, as well as training of EVM processes and tools. The Cost Estimating and Cost Analysis discipline provides support to program and projects in determining life-cycle costs (LCCs) and provides independent cost assessments of on-going projects. Within the PP&amp;C cost estimating and analysis discipline, support for resource data storage and retrieval library will be required. The Resource Data Storage and Retrieval (REDSTAR) Library is a physical and online storage location for documents containing cost, schedule, technical, and programmatic data on NASA and non-NASA projects, along with studies, cost estimates, and other documents of interest to the NASA cost estimating community. The scheduling discipline provides support in the areas of WBS and schedule development, maintenance, analysis, assessments to include schedule risk assessments, and training.</p>
<p>CPSS SME discipline provides highly qualified experienced SME support to program management including, but not limited to, mentoring, strategic program and project planning and alternatives analysis, program cost and schedule projections, project review, and special studies as requested by the Government.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition is a total small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C contract will provide Mission Service PP&amp;C support for MSFC and Johnson Space Center (JSC); however, it will include an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) component to provide additional PP&amp;C support service and SME support Service to MSFC and any other NASA Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical &amp; Service Support Centers, as identified in subsequent awarded task orders, and at such other locations as may be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. The CPSS PP&amp;C contract period of performance will include a one-year base period and four one-year option periods (to be exercised at the Government's discretion). The Mission Services and IDIQ portions of the contract&nbsp;are anticipated to be firm-fixed-price and the SME IDIQ effort is anticipated to be Time and Materials (T&amp;M). Performance-based deductions will apply to the contract in its entirety.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall possess an active Top Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) by the due date for receipt of proposals. Unpopulated Joint Venture (JV) offerors must have Top Secret FCLs for each member of the JV by the specified due date. Utilizing the CAGE code(s) provided, the Government will verify that the offeror possesses an active FCL using the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency's (DCSA) National Industrial Security System (NISS). No offeror will be considered for award that does not have a Top Secret level FCL in place by the due date for receipt of proposals.</p>

The $30,000,000 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread out over the life of the contract including all option years. Each task order will not exceed $3,000,000. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercises is $30,000.</p>
<p>SUSTAINABLE DESIGN:<br />The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects. By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design and "green" building systems. Firms shall validate their sustainable abilities and practices through completed LEED certified construction projects and green building awards and have LEED accredited professionals on staff as part of the firm. <br />Sustainability related executive orders, laws, regulations, best practices, and some recommended products may be found at http://www.nps.gov/dscw/ds-sustainability.htm.</p>
<p>UNIVERSAL DESIGN AND ACCESSIBILITY:<br />The National Park Service is dedicated to making projects universally designed and seamlessly accessible to visitors and staff with disabilities. All planning, design and construction projects shall meet and exceed the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), Section 504 (program access) and Section 508 (electronic and information technology access) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The 2006 NPS Management Policies require that projects exceed these federal requirements and apply the tents of universal design to provide usable and inclusive experience for all. To meet the requirements of Executive Order 13548, "Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities", NPS assures visitor use areas and employee areas are accessible and provide the connectivity to all amenities so that employees with disabilities can fully participate in all programs. <br />Universal Design and Accessibility laws, regulations, checklists, best practices, training modules, standard drawings and specifications may be found at: https://www.nps.gov/dscw/definitionsdc_u.htm#ufas and http://www.nps.gov/dscw/ds-universal-design.htm.</p>
<p>CULTURAL RESOURCES PROTECTION:<br />"The National Park Service will protect, preserve, and foster appreciation of the cultural resources in its custody and demonstrate its respect for the peoples traditionally associated with those resources through appropriate programs of research, planning, and stewardship." (From the preamble to Part 5 of NPS Management Policies.)</p>
<p>Design work under the contract will involve rehabilitation, alteration, addition or improvement of sites and structures containing natural and cultural resources. Historic properties may encompass landscapes, structures, landmarks, and buried resources, requiring accepted treatment approaches reflecting NPS stewardship principles and assuring the longevity of the property. Firms will be required to successfully identify and address resource values and issues, and effectively apply both the Secretary of the Interior's (SOI) Standards and NPS Cultural Resource Management Policies (Directors Order #28). Design interventions must align with stewardship principles acceptable to NPS. Design must not jeopardize the historical or archeological integrity of a property or site. Decisions or actions that would directly result in degradation or loss of historic character or fabric to the resource must be avoided.</p>
<p>Sustainable design must be a viable response to the resource protection goals of a property, favoring sensitive and conservative treatments that are commensurate with established preservation guidelines. A finding of no adverse effect for National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)/Section 106 compliance purposes is the ultimate goal. Designs are informed by contextual awareness with solutions derived from park tradition, existing development, and both local and global environmental factors. Preservation proposals will demonstrate the ethic and philosophy of the Secretary of the Interior's (SOI) Standards for preservation and protection of cultural resources, including: The Treatment of Historic Properties, Guidelines for Cultural Landscape Treatments, and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation. Ability and skill in adhering to the four SOI treatment categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration and Reconstruction, is expected.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation (48 Federal Register (FR) 44716-740) and Standards and Guidelines for Federal Agency Historic Preservation Programs pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act (63 FR 20495-508).</p>
<p>EXECUTIVE ORDERS, LAWS AND REGULATIONS:<br />Comply with Design Imperatives at http://www.nps.gov/dscw/laws-policies.htm plus all applicable Executive Orders, laws and regulations.</p>
<p>PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED:<br />Design services follow DSC workflows, which can be viewed at http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/index.htm. <br />Pre-Design Services:<br />&bull; Project Scoping<br />&bull; Exhibit planning/interpretation <br />&bull; Wayside exhibits and signage <br />&bull; Total life cost modeling<br />&bull; Condition Assessment <br />&bull; Programming (Site Analysis, Site Program, and Facility Program)<br />&bull; Contextual Analysis<br />&bull; Integrated Design Narrative, including Universal Design recommendations<br />&bull; Commissioning, including total building commissioning beginning as early as pre-design and continuing throughout design and construction.<br />&bull; Risk Assessment<br />&bull; Cost Estimate</p>

<p>Design Services:<br />&bull; Designs to include but not limited to schematic, exhibit, etc.<br />&bull; Value Analysis and Value Based Decision Making<br />&bull; Design Development<br />&bull; Construction Documents<br />&bull; Construction Support (including site inspections) <br />&bull; Sustainability/LEED documentation</p>
<p>A documented internal Quality Control program shall be applied to all services performed.</p>
<p>The contractor accepts ultimate responsibility, liability and duty to control the quality of the services provided to the Government as stipulated in the FAR, 36.609-2. The contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the contractor, their employees, agents, assignees, and sub-consultants under the contract. The contractor shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors or deficiencies in its designs, drawings, specifications and other services.</p>
<p>The firm shall demonstrate existence of Quality Control (QC) system that will be used for all work submitted to the National Park Service. The QC system shall be utilized by the prime firm and all subcontractors and shall, at a minimum, include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Coordination of drawings and specifications within each discipline, and between all <br />disciplines.<br />&bull; Verification that all documents to be submitted are accurate and correct.<br />&bull; Checklists for internal review of drawings, specifications, calculations, and cost estimates.<br />&bull; Verification, prior to submittal to the National Park Service, that all required documents for each submission are included and complete, per <br />the contract requirements.<br />&bull; Verification that all required documents have undergone a QC review prior to submittal to the National Park Service. The National Park Service requires documentation and submittal of all QC work completed.</p>
<p>Further information on National Park Service governing laws and policies, standards, definitions, practices and guidelines can be found at http://www.nps.gov/dscw/information.htm.</p>
<p>COORDINATION<br />The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with sub-consultants. The firm will need to have direct contact with Federal, State, or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.</p>
<p>SPECIALIZED SERVICES<br />In the course of doing business with firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from sub-consultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the sub-consultant with little involvement of the prime firm. Even though the work is performed primarily by the sub-consultant, DSC will ensure that the prime firm is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime firm. The effect of "pass throughs" on the overall ceiling for orders placed against an IDIQ contract has been considered in establishing the maximum contract amount for the solicitation and resultant contract(s). Potential firms submitting statements of qualification are advised that the DSC will continue to acquire such specialized services. The DSC does not intend to allow the firm to charge an indirect post-award administration fee to the sub-consultant's services.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br />Statements of qualification will be evaluated by an evaluation team of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence</p>
<p>Firms shall demonstrate specialized experience and technical competence in the types of work described above, including work produced at a level commensurate with similar projects and scope with various degrees of complexity. Project scopes include, but are not limited to, preparation of plans, specification, cost estimates, schedules, supplemental reports, graphics, etc. for each project. Similar project examples that represent a majority of the work that task orders may be issued against any resultant contract include the following:</p>

<p>6. Both large and small businesses shall be required to submit Small Business Participation Plans to identify the 43% required to be performed by small businesses for the life of this requirement. Large business primes may achieve the small business participation goals through subcontracting to small businesses. Small business primes may achieve small business participation goals through their own performance/participation as a prime and also through subcontracting to other small businesses.</p>
<p>All Offerors, both large and small businesses, will be evaluated on the level of proposed participation of U.S. small businesses in the performance of this acquisition (as small business prime offerors or small business subcontractors) relative to the objectives and goals established in the paragraph entitled "Subcontracting Plan Requirement". The government will evaluate:</p>
<p>a. The extent to which such firms are specifically identified in proposals.<br />b. The extent of commitment to use such firms (and enforceable commitments will be considered more favorably than non-enforceable ones. Enforceable commitment is defined as a signed teaming agreement or other prime/subcontract between parties, contingent upon award);<br />c. Identification of the complexity and variety of the work small firms are to perform.<br />d. The extent of participation of small business prime offerors and small business subcontractors in terms of the percentage of the value of the total acquisition; or alternatively may consider the percentage of &lsquo;planned subcontracting' dollars.<br />e. The extent to which the Offeror meets or exceeds the goals outlined in the paragraph below entitled, "Subcontracting Plan Requirement".<br />Additional Important Note for Other Than U.S. Small Businesses ONLY: Small Business Subcontracting Plan is Required (FAR 52.219-9).</p>

Subcontracting Plans shall reflect and be consistent with the commitments offered in the Small Business Participation Plan.</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS<br />The subcontracting plan, which in accordance with Public Law 97-507, requires the contractor to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The selected firm, if a large business, must comply with FAR 52-219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting goals for this contract are that a minimum of 43% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 5% shall be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, 5% shall be placed with women-owned businesses, and 3% shall be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and 3% shall be placed with HUBZone certified firms. The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal; however, upon contract award is contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.</p>
<p>In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (i.e. multiple awards).</p>
<p>Following an evaluation of the qualifications submitted, at least three firm(s) that are considered to be the most highly qualified will be chosen for discussions in accordance with FAR 36.602-1(c). Upon conclusion of these discussions and final ranking of firms, the most highly qualified firm(s) will be selected for price negotiation and other terms and conditions in accordance with FAR 36.606.</p>

By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design and "green" building systems. Firms shall validate their sustainable abilities and practices through completed LEED certified construction projects and green building awards and have LEED accredited professionals on staff as part of the firm. <br />Sustainability related executive orders, laws, regulations, best practices, and some recommended products may be found at http://www.nps.gov/dscw/ds-sustainability.htm. <br /><br />UNIVERSAL DESIGN AND ACCESSIBILITY:<br />The National Park Service is dedicated to making projects universally designed and seamlessly accessible to visitors and staff with disabilities. All planning, design and construction projects shall meet and exceed the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), Section 504 (program access) and Section 508 (electronic and information technology access) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The 2006 NPS Management Policies require that projects exceed these federal requirements and apply the tents of universal design to provide usable and inclusive experience for all. To meet the requirements of Executive Order 13548, "Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities", NPS assures visitor use areas and employee areas are accessible and provide the connectivity to all amenities so that employees with disabilities can fully participate in all programs. <br />Universal Design and Accessibility laws, regulations, checklists, best practices, training modules, standard drawings and specifications may be found at: https://www.nps.gov/dscw/definitionsdc_u.htm#ufas and http://www.nps.gov/dscw/ds-universal-design.htm. <br /><br />"The National Park Service will protect, preserve, and foster appreciation of the cultural resources in its custody and demonstrate its respect for the peoples traditionally associated with those resources through appropriate programs of research, planning, and stewardship." (From the preamble to Part 5 of NPS Management Policies.) <br />Design work under the contract will involve rehabilitation, alteration, addition or improvement of sites and structures containing natural and cultural resources. Historic properties may encompass landscapes, structures, landmarks, and buried resources, requiring accepted treatment approaches reflecting NPS stewardship principles and assuring the longevity of the property. Firms will be required to successfully identify and address resource values and issues, and effectively apply both the Secretary of the Interior's (SOI) Standards and NPS Cultural Resource Management Policies (Directors Order #28). Design interventions must align with stewardship principles acceptable to NPS. Design must not jeopardize the historical or archeological integrity of a property or site. Decisions or actions that would directly result in degradation or loss of historic character or fabric to the resource must be avoided.<br /><br />Sustainable design must be a viable response to the resource protection goals of a property, favoring sensitive and conservative treatments that are commensurate with established preservation guidelines. A finding of no adverse effect for National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)/Section 106 compliance purposes is the ultimate goal. Designs are informed by contextual awareness with solutions derived from park tradition, existing development, and both local and global environmental factors. Preservation proposals will demonstrate the ethic and philosophy of the Secretary of the Interior's (SOI) Standards for preservation and protection of cultural resources, including: The Treatment of Historic Properties, Guidelines for Cultural Landscape Treatments, and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation. Ability and skill in adhering to the four SOI treatment categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration and Reconstruction, is expected.<br /><br />Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation (48 Federal Register (FR) 44716-740) and Standards and Guidelines for Federal Agency Historic Preservation Programs pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act (63 FR 20495-508).<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDERS, LAWS AND REGULATIONS:<br />Comply with Design Imperatives at http://www.nps.gov/dscw/laws-policies.htm plus all applicable Executive Orders, laws and regulations.<br /><br />PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED:<br />Design services follow DSC workflows, which can be viewed at http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/index.htm. <br />Pre-Design Services:<br />&bull; Project Scoping<br />&bull; Exhibit planning/interpretation <br />&bull; Wayside exhibits and signage <br />&bull; Total life cost modeling<br />&bull; Condition Assessment <br />&bull; Programming (Site Analysis, Site Program, and Facility Program)<br />&bull; Contextual Analysis<br />&bull; Integrated Design Narrative, including Universal Design recommendations<br />&bull; Commissioning, including total building commissioning beginning as early as pre-design and continuing throughout design and construction.<br />&bull; Risk Assessment<br />&bull; Cost Estimate</p>

The firm will need to have direct contact with Federal, State, or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.<br /><br />SPECIALIZED SERVICES<br />In the course of doing business with firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from sub-consultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the sub-consultant with little involvement of the prime firm. Even though the work is performed primarily by the sub-consultant, DSC will ensure that the prime firm is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime firm. The effect of "pass throughs" on the overall ceiling for orders placed against an IDIQ contract has been considered in establishing the maximum contract amount for the solicitation and resultant contract(s). Potential firms submitting statements of qualification are advised that the DSC will continue to acquire such specialized services. The DSC does not intend to allow the firm to charge an indirect post-award administration fee to the sub-consultant's services.<br /><br />TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br />Statements of qualification will be evaluated by an evaluation team of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:<br /><br />1.

<DESC><div><br />The contractor shall provide support to the spectrum management and coordination of the 2025-2110 MHz band as a result of the third Advanced Wireless Services (AWS-3) auction.  In March 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in collaboration with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), developed rules for the auction and reallocation of the 1695-1710 MHz and 1755-1780 MHz radio frequency bands, which at that time were allocated exclusively for Federal use.  Between November 2014 and January 2015, the FCC conducted the third Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) auction ("Auction 97") to establish new AWS licenses in the 1695-1710 MHz, 1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz bands.  For reference, AWS-3 Transition information can be found at the following website: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/aws-3-transition</div>
<div><br />The primary objective of the SMCS Development, is to provide an integrated system-of-systems that automates an end-to-end workflow for coordinating spectrum access between DoD system operations and incumbent Television BAS, CARS, and LTTS operations (hereafter referred to as Electronic News Gathering (ENG) operations).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The contractor shall apply an advanced working knowledge of spectrum engineering, spectrum requirements, data management, and business process workflow development to manage SMCS development, deployment, operations, maintenance, and continual enhancement services.  The contractor shall manage the software development lifecycle, delivery and deployment of the initial SMCS capability, and continually enhance the SMCS.  It is envisioned that the spectrum sharing of the 2025-2110 MHz will include a wide range of sharing scenarios, including cases where DoD access has been pre-coordinated with the ENG community, and cases where active coordination between DoD and the ENG community will be required.  SMCS shall be able to facilitate these various sharing scenarios.  The contractor shall implement industry standard agile development methodologies to develop and deliver the initial operational release of the SMCS, continuing to develop and deliver additional features and automation.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions should be addressed to franky.m.awuvey.civ@mail.mil and jhoonku.jee.civ@mail.mil. Please provide any questions, in writing, no later than November 12, 2019 at 2:00pm (EST).  The Government reserves the right to not answer questions submitted after this time.<br /> <br />Proposals are due no later than December 2, 2019 at 2:00pm (EST) and should be submitted the following email addresses: franky.m.awuvey.civ@mail.mil and jhoonku.jee.civ@mail.mil</p>

<DESC>We are requesting comments addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for solicitation W9126G20R0007, Job Order Contract (JOC), Fort Hood, TX. Reference FAR Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement and Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.
<p>DFARS 236.204 Disclosure of the magnitude of construction projects. Range of Magnitude: $100,000,000 - $250,000,000.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project.<br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy Subpart 22.503:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement, (PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurements. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...</p>
<p>2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, please provide your comments on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLA's be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Texas area? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require a prime contractor and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in or around the Fort Hood, Killeen, Texas area?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet the Small Business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Note: For yes or no answers, please provide a supporting narrative.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: Craig.d.harper@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 1 November 2019 Central Time 10:00 AM.</p>
