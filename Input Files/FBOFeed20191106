<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Next-generation Airborne Directional Networking</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: FA8750-20-S-7003</p>
<p><strong>PART I - OVERVIEW INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>This announcement is for an Open, 2 Step BAA which is open and effective until 29 Sep 2023. Only white papers will be accepted as initial submissions; formal proposals will be accepted by invitation only. While white papers will be considered if received prior to 2 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 29 Sep 2023, the following submission dates are suggested to best align with projected funding:</p>
<p>FY20 by 15 Nov 2019<br />FY21 by 5 Jul 2020<br />FY22 by 4 Jul 2021<br />FY23 by 3 Jul 2022</p>
<p>Offerors should monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">http://www.fbo.gov</a> in the event this announcement is amended.<br /><br />CONCISE SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENT: Seeking innovative research, development, integration, test, evaluation and delivery of technologies/techniques for next-generation, highly-directional, networked aerial layer communications.</p>
<p>Directionality allows focusing a greater amount of radiated energy on an intended receiver, improving interference resistance and/or increasing link capacity. Further, it reduces the amount of energy radiated in directions other than towards the intended receiver, reducing interference with other network nodes (self-fratricide) as well as observability (lower probability of detection/intercept), towards enabling/restoring critical communications functions.</p>
<p>BAA ESTIMATED FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.8M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $100k to $900k. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value as long as the value does not exceed the available BAA ceiling amount.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED INDIVIDUAL AWARDS: Multiple Awards are anticipated.</p>
<p>TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE AWARDED: Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions (OT) depending upon the nature of the work proposed. In the event that an Other Transaction for Prototype agreement is awarded as a result of this competitive BAA, and the prototype project is successfully completed, there is the potential for a prototype project to transition to award of a follow-on production contract or transaction. The Other Transaction for Prototype agreement itself will also contain a similar notice of a potential follow-on production contract or agreement.</p>
<p>AGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION: All white paper submissions and any questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) as specified below (unless otherwise specified in the technical area):</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BAA MANAGER</span>: <br />Richard Butler <br />AFRL/RITF <br />525 Brooks Rd<br />Rome, NY 13441-4505 <br />Telephone: (315) 330-4372 <br />Email: <a href="mailto:richard.butler.10@us.af.mil">richard.butler.10@us.af.mil</a></p>

Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>

<DESC>The F108 Workload Augmentation acquisition synopsized shall supplement continued organic engine production at United States Air Force (USAF) Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC). Primarily due to poor material supportability, organic production has not met remanufacture objectives and despite multiple contract efforts to improve support, production continues to lag. As such, the acquisition herein seeks to establish a temporary augmentation to organic support with commercial sources to improve whole engine overhaul output and also, re-energize the industrial base for the remanufacture of this engine. This strategic long-term contract will ensure F108 production supportability is maintained which in-turn will enhance War Readiness Equipment (WRE) availability.
<p>The USAF has identified two approved sources for remanufacture. As such, the acquisition has been approved for Other than Full and Open Competition as prescribed by FAR 6.302-1. The solicitation will be a limited competition FAR 12 acquisition with CFM International (CFMI) (CAGE 58828) and Lockheed Martin Commercial Engine Solutions (LMCES) (CAGE L06Y2) to require the overhaul for the F108-100 engine to the F108-100A.<br /><br />The acquisition is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Firm Fixed Price contract type. The term will be a one-year base period with four, one-year option periods. The total duration (base plus option period) shall not exceed five years. As indicated above, the F108 workload augmentation effort has been approved as a limited source acquisition to CFMI and LMCES. The solicitation will be available at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/ on its issue date, on or around 22 Feb 19 and will close on/about 21 Feb 20. Hard copies will not be available.</p>

<DESC>DLA Aviation intends to issue a solicitation to acquire NSN: 1560-01-396-0310 under a sole source long-term contract utilizing FAR Part 15 procedure. One NSN is targeted for this contract effort. If other NSNs are subsequently added as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. It is anticipated that the estimated annual quantity of 26 each will be priced for the initial contract award. The proposed contract will include one base year and four, one-year option periods.
<p>The agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies available from limited sources whom possess and demonstrated the unique capabilities required. The Government does not have adequate data, lacks rights to data, or both needed to purchase this part from additional sources. As a result, the Government intends to award on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>All contractors must meet prequalification requirements in order to be registered as a potential source. Firms that possess the ability and can produce the required item(s) described are encouraged to identify themselves and seek source approval in order to compete for future solicitations.</p>
<p>A SAR package allows a potential source of supply the opportunity to comprise a package with adequate data to sufficiently evaluate a manufacturing facility in their attempt of becoming an approved source of supply for a DLA managed product. The burden of proof is on the potential source of supply. For help in completing a request, access the Source Approval and Management Handbook.</p>
<p>If there is an open solicitation for a national stock number for which you want to submit a SAR, submit it directly to the buyer noted on the solicitation. <br />If you are submitting a SAR for a NSN with no open solicitation, please send it to DLA Aviation, Attn: DLA AVN-DU (SAR Program Manager), 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway, Richmond, VA 23297-5100.</p>
<p>SARs may or may not be processed and/or reviewed if it is determined that the SAR is not cost effective. The review process can take over 180 days from the date the SAR is received by DLA Aviation. Once a decision is made, you will receive a formal notification letter advising you of the results. If you have any questions, please call the DLA Aviation SAR analyst at 804-279-5114.</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY. The anticipated solicitation date is November 21, 2019 and will be available on the DLA Internet Bid Board System at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil Solicitations are in portable document format (PDF). To download and view these documents you will need the latest version of the Adobe Acrobat reader. This software is available free at http://www.adobe.com.</p>

All proposals received after the closing date listed shall be considered "late" and shall not be considered for award.</p>

<CONTACT>Julie A. Bardo, Contracting Officer, Phone 984-287-3003, Email Julie.Bardo@nih.gov
<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice follows a Sources Sought notice that was released on September 30, 2019 under notice number NIHES2020_Genetox.
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to negotiate and award a contract for services and support to examine a variable number of chemicals annually, depending on the needs of the government, for up to ten (10) years for induction of genetic changes (e.g., mutations, chromosomal changes, DNA damage, base sequence changes, differential gene expression profiles) in cells obtained from exposed animals, including laboratory rats and mice, and/or humans. A variable number and mix of studies designed to evaluate these types of endpoints may be conducted annually. As an example, studies may include comet assays to assess DNA damage in multiple tissues of rats and mice, and peripheral blood micronucleus assays to measure the frequency of red blood cells with evidence of chromosomal damage. The contractor will also provide services and support to examine chemicals for ability to induce these same kinds of genetic changes in cultured cells. It is anticipated that approximately 20 chemicals (or chemical mixtures) may be evaluated in one or multiple genotoxicity assays annually, although this number may fluctuate based upon the needs of the government. Because technologies applied to the investigation of exposure-induced genetic toxicities are in a state of rapid evolution and expansion, the contract will include a research and development effort directed toward refining existing techniques and integrating new technologies into the NTP testing program to maintain a high level of scientific capability and relevance.</p>
<p><br />Section 508 Conformance: Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for this contract. In order to conform to the Section 508 Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, the contractor shall perform all work required under the resultant contract in compliance with the provisions delineated in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 36 (36 CFR Part 1194). Contract deliverables are required to be compliant with Section 508 requirements. All respondents to any solicitation will be required to self-certify that they can comply Section 508 requirements for contract deliverables. Additional information on Section 508 including NIH's 508 policy can be found at https://ocio.nih.gov/ITGovPolicy/NIH508/Pages/default.aspx.</p>
<p>Contract Type and Contractor's Accounting System: It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. Therefore, to be considered for an award under the resultant solicitation, the offeror's accounting system and practices must be adequate and suitable for accumulating costs under government contracts. Offerors will be required to provide evidence of the accounting system being adequate and the proposal shall include a certification that the offeror's accounting system meets all of the specifications outlined in the solicitation for an adequate accounting system, in accordance with FAR 16.301-3, 16.403-1, and in compliance with FAR Part 31.</p>
<p>Solicitation Details: The Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be available on or about December 2, 2019. The RFP will only be available electronically and must be accessed through the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov). All information required for submission of a proposal will be contained in the electronic RFP package. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Website for the release of this RFP and amendments, if any. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. This notice is not a Request for Proposals and does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>The solicitation is anticipated to result in one (1) award to an offeror capable of performing all aspects of the work described in the SOW. It is anticipated that a single award, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research and development services will be awarded on or before June 6, 2020 for a base period of one-year, plus nine (9) successive one-year option periods. The proposed contract is anticipated to be issued using full and open competition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541715 with a corresponding size standard of 1,000 employees. The Government intends to make an award using the procedures for competitive negotiated acquisitions as authorized in FAR Part 15.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire, via full and open competition, analytical, engineering, scientific, and programming services in support of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).  Support shall include warfare and warfare support analyses and assessments, campaign analyses, mission level analyses, data analytics, modeling and simulation (M and S), and management and documentation support.  The analytic support shall encompass all aspects of joint campaign, mission and engagement level modeling as well as manpower and personnel, training and education, infrastructure, long-term planning, policy, medical logistics planning, and both afloat and ashore readiness.
The analytic capabilities will include experimentation, demonstrations, and wargaming elements that enable exploration of operational options and identification of operator objectives and considerations.

The contractor shall be required to provide coordination across the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) staff, the Fleet, Systems Commands (SYSCOMs), Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), Marine Corps and other Service Staffs, Joint Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) staff.

To effectively carry out the responsibilities required to produce the deliverables associated with the above requirements, potential contractors must possess both the corporate knowledge, as well as the uniquely qualified personnel.
 Subsequent task orders will be deliverable-based and the approach in which a potential contractor provides said deliverables will be paramount to the overall success of the program.

Travel is anticipated. The Government anticipates performance will begin around 1 Nov 2020 and will continue, as required, for five years thereafter. For planning purposes, the total estimated level of effort over the 5-year ordering period is 384,384.  The applicable NAICs code is 541611 âAdministrative Management and General Management Consulting Servicesâ The small business size standard for this NAICS is $16.5 million in annual receipts.  The FSC Code is R499.

It is the intent of the Government to process this procurement under FAR 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and to ultimately award multiple, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) cost-plus- fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts as a result of the forthcoming solicitation.

The IDIQ contracts will allow for both CPFF and firm-fixed-price (FFP) type task orders.
Offerors will be required to submit non-cost/price (technical) and cost/price proposals. The Government anticipates that the resultant contracts will be awarded on a best value basis where the non-cost/price (technical) volume will be considered more important than the cost/price volume.

Upon its release, the solicitation will be issued electronically and be available for downloading at the NECO website: http://www.neco.navy.mil or https://beta.sam.gov in the Dec 2019 timeframe. [Effective 12 November 2019, FBO.gov will officially transition to the Beta.SAM.gov âContracting Opportunitiesâ platform. NAVSUP is currently working on having NECO be the NAVSUP system interface with Beta.SAM.Gov.]

The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP.
Paper copies, faxed copies, or email copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the RFP and any amendments thereto. The Government will not pay for the information received.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by NAVSUP FLC Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office.  By submitting an offer, the offeror is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.
 By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award.

Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at https://www.sam.gov/SAM/.   Further, offerors are required to go on-line to the SAM website to complete their Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to the submittal of their proposal.

<p>The Air Force is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement. <br />&nbsp;<br />THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitations:<br />The items listed for repair have been screened with a Repair Method Code (RMC)/Repair Method Suffix Code (RMSC) code of R3/R. The government does not have sufficient data rights to provide drawings or technical engineering data pertaining to the repairable assets. The government also does not possess rights to the test procedures, repair processes and test equipment required to certify the repair.&nbsp; No data other than the product specification can be provided to interested vendors.</p>
<p>Interested companies should seek qualification from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Lockheed Martin (CAGE 3VQD6), for authorization and certification to perform repairs.&nbsp; If OEM authorization is not received, the company seeking Government source approval will need to clearly identify how the company will overcome the lack of Government data rights and test equipment in order to potentially allow Government qualification independent of the OEM authorization and certification.</p>

All responses must be received NLT 12:00 local Maryland time on 20 November 2019. All questions and comments must be in writing; no telephone calls will be accepted. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>Purpose: Request for Information - Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) - Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) is one of the Department of Defense's (DoD's) foremost test and training ranges supporting DoD, non-DoD and commercial material developers by testing a broad spectrum of equipment throughout the life cycle, from concept through deployment.</p>
<p>ATC has a continuing need for scientific and routine engineering support for the development of cutting-edge instrumentation systems and test facilities. Due to the test mission and staff constraints at ATC, the development and fabrication of instrumentation and test facilities at the rate required is not feasible solely with in-house Government personnel; therefore, these services have historically been also provided by Contractors. These services need to be of a quick response nature to provide instrumentation without costly delays to high priority test programs.</p>
<p>The intent of this RFI is to gauge industry interest, capability and relevant experience to provide these routine scientific and engineering support services in furtherance of ATC's mission. This contract would cover support for all instrumentation and test facilities designed and needed to collect test specific data for all prototypes, materiel, and non-military items and/or systems specified in the contract.

<p>Place of Contract Performance: This contract requires work at ATC and at various Contractor, subcontractor, and Government facilities. The work will be performed at the location specified in each individual Task Order.</p>
<p>Contract Type: At this time, this requirement is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders.</p>
<p>Major Support Services: <br />The objective of this contract is to develop and enhance instrumentation designs, fabricate low quantities of prototypes, provide instrumentation user manuals, and design and install test facilities. A quick response to these requirements is often required.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to:<br />&bull; Provide routine engineering services in support of testing, test facilities, and instrumentation.<br />&bull; Provide on-site instruction and manuals for use and operation of equipment and systems it designs, fabricates, and/or installs.<br />&bull; Document lessons learned in the course of design, fabrication, and testing of instrumentation for consideration by subject matter experts for future designs.</p>

Statement of Work (SOW)/Specifications Template/Guide


Background 

Voluntary Service, a section of Community Engagement & Veteran Experience (CEVE), is authorized to use donated funds to provide transportation to Veterans, even those not eligible for beneficiary travel.  To facilitate patient flow, utilization/bed management, patient safety, access to care, and patient experience, we require a process where specific VA staff can order transportation as needed for the above purposes. A ride-share service provides this solution and can be paid from General Post Funds controlled by Voluntary Service.

Objectives
 
The objective is to remove transportation barriers. Our Beneficiary Travel office piloted use of this service two years ago, and has currently implemented it, seeing improvements in patient flow, utilization/bed management, patient safety, access to care, and patient experience. Lack of transportation is a barrier to access, care (especially ambulatory surgery) and discharge, and is a source of patient anxiety and thus patient experience. 

Scope 

This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for VA staff to procure transportation services that will improve patient flow, utilization/bed management, patient safety, access to care, and patient experience. The SOW includes the associated requirements for the scope of work to be performed, place of performance, period of performance, schedule of deliveries, and acceptance procedures.

STATEMENT OF WORK 

Shooting Range Usage for VA Police Yearly Qualifications   

Introduction/Background

The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System provides quality health care to veterans using the abilities of all employees supported by our commitment to education and research.

The VA Police is the uniformed law enforcement service of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, responsible for the protection and security of the VA Medical Centers and other facilities such as Outpatient Clinics (OPC) and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) operated by the VA. The VA Police have several divisions and operate separately but alongside the VA Law Enforcement Training Center (VA LETC) under the umbrella of the Office of Security and Law Enforcement. The primary role of VA Police is to serve as a protective uniformed police force in order to deter and prevent crime, maintain order, and investigate crimes (ranging from summonses to felony offenses) which may have occurred within the jurisdiction of the Department or its federal assets. Some cases are investigated in conjunction with agents from the Office of the Inspector General (VA OIG).
The VA Police are an armed, federal law enforcement and protective service entity that operates in and around the various Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, National Cemeteries and other VA facilities located throughout the whole of United States to include Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Among others, the VA Police are a specialized federal law enforcement agency, whose officers have full police powers derived from statutory authority to enforce all federal laws, VA rules and regulations, and to make arrests on VA controlled property whether owned or leased. In the event of an active shooter the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Police need to be properly equipped to safeguard Veteran patients, employees and visitors. 

Per VA Directive 0720, Veterans Affairs Police Officers must qualify with the department firearm four times per year for regular qualification and low light qualification.
Because of this required firearm training, range time is needed on a yearly schedule. The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System has no shooting ranges on property. In order to qualify, the VA Police must purchase indoor/outdoor range hours from two ranges in the tri-state area.  

Requirements/Objective

Indoor/Outdoor Firearm Shooting Range Usage
130 Hours
Firearm Range must be an approved course and sanctioned by OS&LE

Range must comply with the EPA requirements for the management of lead and other hazardous materials. 
Range must comply with all federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules and requirements relating to firearm usage and safety.

<p>Classification Code:<br />15 - Aircraft and Airframe Structural Components<br />16 - Aircraft Components and Accessories</p>
<p>NAICS Code:<br />423860 - Primary<br />336413 - Secondary<br /><br />PROGRAM OVERVIEW:<br />DLA-Aviation, Richmond is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities and experience to provide a strategic support solution for a subset of NSNs under Federal Supply Classes (FSC) 1560, Airframe Structural Components; 1660, Aircraft Air Conditioning, Heating, and Pressurizing Equipment; and 1680, Miscellaneous Aircraft Accessories and Components. The attached list represents NSNs with active requisitions within the last two years. The approximate annual demand value for these parts is $469 million. DLA is considering putting these NSNs on long-term contract, and anticipates a single award proposed contract, of up to 10 years in length.</p>
<p>Please note: DLA is also exploring the possibility of adding support for Depot Level Repairs (DLR) spares on this contract. However, DLR NSNs are currently not present on the accompanying NSN list attachment.</p>
<p>Scope of project: This initiative contains 17,368 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) purchased and/or managed by DLA. Of these NSNs, 2,188 are considered priority and compromise approximately 80% of the total projected spend. The NSN list is attached to this RFI. This list possesses the following fields: National Item Identification Number (NIIN), Federal Supply Class, priority flag, Production Lead Time (PLT), OEM cage codes and part numbers, and projected demand quantity over 5 years. Additionally, the NSNs in this list are also pre-sorted by projected spend from highest to lowest.<br />Please provide your CAGE, Company name, address, and point of contact information.</p>
<p>1. Please indicate if your firm is a manufacturer, dealer/distributor, integrator, or other (explain).</p>
<p>2. Describe your current distribution capabilities (E.g., ability to meet customer requirements, surge capabilities, etc.)</p>
<p>3. In a customer direct (CD) supply arrangement, the contractor forecasts demand, manufactures the NSN or procures it from a sub-contractor, stocks, and ships directly to DLA customers (within the Time-Definite-Delivery standards of either 1 or 3 days). CD items may be shipped in commercial packaging unless otherwise stated. In a DLA-Direct (DD) supply arrangement, the contractor manufactures the NSN or procures it from a sub-contractor and ships to a DLA depot upon completion of the order; time to complete the order is based upon a negotiated production lead-time; contractor does not forecast, stock or ship to the DLA customer.<br />a. Please describe what commercial infrastructure you have in place to support a CD supply arrangement.<br />b. What additional infrastructure do you need (if any) to fully meet this requirement?</p>
<p>4. Provide a percentage breakdown of your current sales to commercial and government customers.</p>
<p>5. Would you consider partnering with another commercial company if you could not provide nationwide service? If so, would your interest be as a prime or subcontractor?</p>
<p>6. Can your company comply with all military product-marking requirements and packaging (E.g., RFID, commercial packaging, MIL STD packing)?</p>
<p>7. Please describe your experience and ability to meet quality and special testing requirements (including, but not limited to: Certificate of Quality Compliance, Product Verification Testing, Production Lot Testing, and First Article Testing).</p>
<p>8. Indicate your firm's business size (certified small or large). <br />a. If small business, under which NAICS code(s) are you considered a small business? <br />b. Which small business sub-category does your company qualify under (if any)? (8A, HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman Owned Small Business, etc.)</p>
<p>9. Please answer the following questions on your ability to support for priority and non-priority NSNs:<br />a. What percentage of these NSNs can you support today on a CD basis? <br />b. What percentage of these NSNs can you support today on a DLA Direct (DD) basis? In DD, the contractor has to manufacture or procure the item and ship to DLA-depots. In addition, MIL STD packaging requirements may apply.<br />c. What percentage of NSNs can you support on both CD and DD?<br />d. Is there a percentage of these NSNs you can support on neither CD nor DD? Explain.<br />e. Did you use any information besides the NSN number itself to make these estimates? This may include company specific information (E.g., existing supplier relationships) or NSN level information (E.g., AAC code). If you did, please explain.</p>
<p>10. How would you propose to structure the NSN population (E.g., Would you delete any NSNs? Would you have separate contract terms for a subset of NSNs? Would you create sub-lists based on item characteristics?)<br />a. How would you structure differently (if at all) for First Article Test (FAT), Critical Safety (CSI), and Production Lot Testing (PLT) items?</p>
<p>11. DLA is considering including Depot-Level Reparable (DLR) items onto this contract. DLR's are generally purchased by DLA but managed by the Services. Please describe your experience (if any) supporting DLR items.<br />a. What additional infrastructure do you need (if any) to support DLR procurement?<br />b. What operating model would you recommend for DLR support? CD, DD, or an alternative?</p>

How would this change (if at all) across CD/DD support arrangements or NSN groupings?<br />b. What do you envision the structure of the contract to look like (E.g., number of years, number of line items, etc.)?<br />c. How would you factor in price changes across contract length?</p>
<p>13. Is there any additional information or data that would help you price and prepare a proposal?</p>
<p>14. For shipping, DLA requires the use of DLA/DCMA Vendor Shipping Module (VSM).<br />a. What percentage of your annual government shipments are on VSM?<br />b. Does using VSM inhibit your ability to perform in anyway?</p>
<p>15. Describe your firm's ability to meet the Time Definite Delivery (TDD) standards listed below for high priority orders. Identify previous efforts where you were required to support specific timed deliveries and any risks associated with the effort.

<p>17. What performance indicators would you suggest for contract evaluation (E.g., on time delivery, material availability, etc.)?<br />a. How should this change (if at all) across CD/DD support arrangements or NSN groupings?<br />b. Are you amenable to penalties for unmet performance goals? Why or why not?</p>
<p>18. Would you want a ramp up period for this contract? <br />a. If yes, what is a reasonable ramp up period for a contract of this magnitude?</p>
<p>19. How many NSNs would you be able to feasibly price within 90 days? Within 120 days?</p>
<p>20. What additional services would you be able (if any) to provide for this NSN population (E.g., vendor managed inventory, inventory buybacks, other discounts, etc.)?</p>
<p>Summary Information:<br />The purpose of this RFI is to allow industry to provide input regarding not only your capabilities relative to the proposed requirement, but also to provide input of your experience and best practices that will allow the Government to develop an acquisition/solicitation strategy. A key part of this is determining feasibility of requisitioning all listed NSNs under a single contract. DLA encourages any suggestions to sub-divide and/or group the NSNs if that would increase the competitiveness of the proposed contracting process.</p>

<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small businesses capable of providing on-site pathology services for the services described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is&#8208; 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services; Small Business Size Standard is $14.0 million.</p>
<p>The FDA/NCTR/ requires On-site pathology services in support of FDA's mission, , on various animals in, but not limited to, the following areas: 1) major services and functional support; 2) gross pathology; 3) histology; 4) pathologist services; 5) Clinical Chemistry; 6) immunohistochemistry and special procedures; 7) molecular pathology and methods development; 8) digital imaging; 9) data management; 10) archive management (wet tissue and block/slide); 11) internal quality assurance; 12) quality control; and 13) administrative services and management.</p>
<p>The anticipated performance period is a base year with up to four (4) 1-year option periods.<br /><br />Part I: Background: <br />The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Office of Scientific Coordination has a requirement for pathology services in support of FDA's mission. NCTR is located at the Jefferson Laboratories of the FDA in Jefferson, Arkansas, approximately 35 miles south of Little Rock and 28 miles north of Pine Bluff. NCTR is an internationally recognized FDA research center that conducts toxicological research studies and other research activities designed to support the FDA's mission to protect the public's health. NCTR investigators collaborate with researchers elsewhere in the FDA as well as other government agencies, industry, and academia. FDA/NCTR and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) have had an interagency agreement (IAA) since 1992, through which the FDA collaborates with the National Toxicology Program (NTP) to design and conduct toxicological studies involving compounds of regulatory interest to the FDA. Many of the studies at NCTR must follow the FDA's Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines. NCTR is comprised of six research divisions and has facilities including: 132 general or special purpose research laboratories; a phototoxicology research center; an imaging center including microPET, MRI, and CT scanner; a nanotechnology core facility; an inhalation toxicology facility and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited animal facilities, including, but not limited to, rodent facilities accommodating conventional housing, specific pathogen free rodent production colony, isolators for germ-free rodents, and quarantine; a non-human primate research center; a zebrafish production facility.</p>
<p>General Information<br />The Contractor shall conduct the pathology services on each study to the requirements/parameters established by the NCTR Principal Investigators (PIs). The Contractor shall work closely with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and PI to plan, implement, perform, report and archive the research protocols. Planning includes, but is not limited to, developing cost estimates, schedules, and work plans to be performed for each study. Research protocols written by the PIs will determine the pathology support requirements, which range from necropsy of a few animals and collection of a few tissues to complete necropsy (collection of &ge;44 tissues) of over a thousand animals requiring special handling of tissues, histopathology, special staining or other techniques (immunohistochemistry, digital imaging, etc.), hematology, urinalysis, and/or clinical chemistry. Other required techniques include, but are not limited to, teratology techniques, reproductive and developmental toxicology techniques, respiratory pathology techniques (inhalation toxicology studies), sperm morphology and motility analysis, vaginal cytology, vaginal smears for sperm evaluations, and mammary whole mounts. Some protocols may include requirements for histopathological processing, including immunohistochemistry, of human tissues or cells. Pathologists will not be expected to provide diagnoses for human tissues. The Contractor shall ensure that all protocol pathology requirements are followed with particular attention to detail.<br />On-site pathology services for the animal studies performed at NCTR have been obtained through contracts since the Center's inception in 1972. In 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, the numbers of studies per year with pathology requirements were 56, 43, 39, 40, and 33, respectively. At any given time, pathology services are being conducted on approximately 10-15 different studies.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information. <br />The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ has a requirement for the development and test of the Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Night Vision Device (NVD) Compatible Runway Lighting System as well as five (5) Fixed Price option years for production of the EAF NVD Compatible Runway Lighting System to fulfill the United States Marine Corps (USMC) requirement. The system will consist of Light Emitting Diode (LED) based elevated runway lights, flush deck runway lights, runway threshold lights, and an accompanying constant current regulator (CCR) to provide power and control. The LED-based, NVD Compatible Runway Lighting System will support the requirement for CAT-I Precision IFR (200-ft ceiling, &frac12;-sm visibility) operations. The system will also be compatible within land-based arresting gear tape sweep areas. The system will emit both visible and infrared light to be compatible with both degraded meteorological visible and NVD aided conditions.
<p>The only known contractor that can provide this requirement Hughey &amp; Phillips LLC (formerly Astronics DME). Hughey &amp; Phillips developed the power and control infrastructure that is implemented via the CCR and single conductor cabling. The protocol that enables this capability is proprietary to Hughey &amp; Phillips. Hughey &amp; Phillips currently makes LED-based Runway Lighting components that can be adapted to this technology and implemented for the USMC EAF mission, ensuring seamless integration and control. Other Commercial Lighting Manufacturers would not be able to replicate the necessary power and control protocol due to their proprietary nature.</p>

ACADEMIC AND SIMULATOR TRAINING ON THE T-44C (Beechcraft King Air C-90 with ProLine 21) AIRCRAFT
RFP N6134020R0031

INTRODUCTION
Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to support the Navyâs Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) program for academic and simulator training on the T-44C ProLine 21 (a Navy configured King Air C-90 with ProLine 21) aircraft.  

NAWCTSD intends to award a sole source to CAE for the CACT T-44C training courses. The acquisition strategy of a Sole Source procurement is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
FAR 6.302-1, IAW (ii) These services are available only from the original source because it is a follow-on contract for a highly specialized equipment and it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâs requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 3304(b)(2).)
Other interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than 4 pm, EST, 06 December 2019.  

The results of the Sources Sought will be utilized to determine if any other sources are capable of satisfying the agencyâs requirements.  This market research tool is being used to identify any other potential and eligible contractors, of all sizes, prior to determining the method of acquisition.
The contractor(s) must be capable of providing ALL training requirements identified and not just a portion of training in accordance with the schedule below. Any contractor teaming with sub-contractor(s) must propose as a single Prime Contractor.

Estimated Request for Proposal release:  31 Mar 2020
Estimated Award:  31 August 2020.
Contract Start Date (Date Training must begin): 01 October 2020
Period of Performance:  60 months.

In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone Small Business concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), 8(a) certified Small Business concerns, Woman-Owned Small Business concerns or Small Business concerns, or solicit Unrestricted. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, with a small business size standard of $27.5 Million. The estimated value of the procurement is between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000. Performance and/or Payment bonds will be required.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking Interested Vendors with successful past performance, current relevant experience, personnel/resources, equipment, and capability to perform the following work:</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, materials, tools, vehicles, supervision, and other items and services required to hydraulically dredge approximately 4,745 cubic yards (CY) out of the channel at STA Jones Beach. Dredge to -8' below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), plus a 1' of allowable over-dredge to -9' MLLW. Dredge back slopes at a ratio of 1 vertical to 3 horizontal. Material dredged beyond -9' MLLW will not be paid for. Dredge spoils will be de-watered on-site at STA Jones Beach, and then trucked to 110 Sand Company landfill in Melville, NY for final disposal. A confined de-watering facility (CDF) will need to be constructed on-site at STA Jones Beach to de-water the dredge spoils from the hydraulic dredge. The upland site will need to be fully restored to its pre-dredge condition at the end of the project. Final permits are in the process of being secured. We are anticipating the dredge work to begin as early as the summer of 2020, or no later than the fall of 2020. The dredge material ranges from 38% to 88% sand, 9% to 49% silt, up to 13% clay, and up to 11% gravel, depending on the location within the dredge area.

<p>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone Small Business concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), 8(a) certified Small Business concerns, Woman-Owned Small Business concerns or Small Business concerns, or solicit Unrestricted. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, with a small business size standard of $27.5 Million. The estimated value of the procurement is between $2,000,000 and $2,500,000. Performance and/or Payment bonds will be required.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking Interested Vendors with successful past performance, current relevant experience, personnel/resources, equipment, and capability to perform the following work:</p>
<p>At STA Shinnecock, there are two separate areas to be dredged. The Base Bid, "Area A", is the boat basin. Optional Bid Item 1, "Area C", is Ponquogue Channel South.</p>
<p>Area A - Base Bid: Mechanically dredge approximately 4,933 cubic yards (CY) at the north half of the boat basin, and entrance to the boat basin, at STA Shinnecock. Dredge to -8' below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), plus a 1' of allowable over-dredge to -9' MLLW. Dredge back slopes at a ratio of 1 vertical to 3 horizontal. Material dredged beyond -9' MLLW will not be paid for. Due to the high silt content of the dredge spoils, mechanical dredging will be necessary. Stay 5' away from the existing steel sheet pile breakwater structure and any other structures. Dredging will be needed around the existing USCG floating docks. Contractor will have to temporarily remove and relocate the floating docks to a separate area one at a time within the boat basin. All existing floating dock guide piles will remain. While the floating docks are temporarily relocated, USCG boats will not use them. Once the area around the floating docks is dredged, contractor shall return and reinstall the floating docks, including the existing gangways. Dredge spoils will be de-watered on-site at STA Shinnecock, and then trucked to 110 Sand Company landfill in Melville, NY for final disposal. The de-watering area must not allow any water runoff to return to Shinnecock Bay. The upland site will need to be fully restored to its pre-dredge condition at the end of the project. Final permits are in the process of being secured. We are anticipating the dredge work to begin as early as the summer of 2020, or no later than the fall of 2020. The dredge material ranges from 13% to 69% sand, 49% to 65% silt, up to 21% clay, and up to 2% gravel, depending on the location within the dredge area.</p>
<p>Area C - Option Bid Item 1: Mechanically dredge approximately 4,810 cubic yards (CY) from the channel leading to USCG STA Shinnecock, which is locally referred to as Ponquogue Channel South. Dredge to -9' below MLLW, plus a 1' of allowable over-dredge to -10' MLLW. Dredge back slopes at a ratio of 1 vertical to 3 horizontal. Material dredged beyond -10' MLLW will not be paid for. USCG is seeking permits to allow either mechanical or hydraulic dredge methods to be used for the channel, as there is a higher sand content in the channel, however, due to lack of room on-site at STA Shinnecock to construct an adequate confined dewatering facility to dewater hydraulic dredge spoils, the dredge method for the channel shall be restricted to mechanical means only. Dredge spoils will be de-watered on-site at STA Shinnecock, and then trucked to 110 Sand Company landfill in Melville, NY for final disposal. If hydraulic dredging is used, then a confined de-watering facility (CDF) will need to be constructed on-site at STA Shinnecock, to de-water the dredge spoils from the hydraulic dredge. The upland site will need to be fully restored to its pre-dredge condition at the end of the project. Final permits are in the process of being secured. We are anticipating the dredge work to begin as early as the summer of 2020, or no later than the fall of 2020. The dredge material ranges from 79% to 93% sand, 2% to 7% silt, up to 7% clay, and up to 5% gravel, depending on the location within the dredge area.</p>
<p>NOTE: The dredge work around the floating docks at STA Shinnecock will need to proceed as quickly as possible, to minimize the relocation time of the floating docks. The dredge quantity around the floating docks themselves is not expected to be very high.</p>
<p>To be further refined, but roughly 3 months are expected from contract award to 100% contract completion for each of the dredge areas.</p>
<p>If your firm is interested in this requirement, and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by email to <a href="mailto:Teresa.L.Lamphere@uscg.mil">Teresa.L.Lamphere@uscg.mil</a>&nbsp;and <a href="mailto:Jean.M.Bretz@uscg.mil">Jean.M.Bretz@uscg.mil</a> with "Sources Sought Notice 70Z0G1-20-S-DREDGESTASHIN" in the subject line.</p>

Included in this sources-sought notice are contractors with the ability to provide upgraded models to the systems mentioned above such as the PXUV5D or newer along with replacement lamps and mobile disinfection PODs for potential future replacements or trade-ins of the systems currently in place.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 811219 with a $22.0 million small business size standard. Interested parties must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).

<DESC>1.	Background. Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Executive Order (EXORD) 057-14 (U) established the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence (CCoE) and designated the CCoE Commanding General (CG) as the Force Modernization Proponent for Cyberspace Operations, Signal Communications Networks and Information Services (Signal), and Electronic Warfare (EW); and established the Signal and Cyber Schools.  The EXORD further directed the CCoE to partner with the Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE) for institutional intelligence support to Cyberspace Operations. To that end, the CG directed the establishment of an annual Prototyping Experiment to identify innovative solutions that can close critical capability gaps relating to Army Warfighting Challenge # 7:  Conduct Space and Cyber Electromagnetic Operations and Maintain Communications - How to assure uninterrupted access to critical communications and information links (satellite communications [SATCOM], positioning, navigation, and timing [PNT], and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR]) across a multi-domain architecture when operating in a contested, congested, and competitive operating environment?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.	Intent. The CCoE will conduct an annual Cyberspace Operations, Signal, and EW Prototyping Experiment called Cyber Quest (CQ) to assess emerging technologies against associated Army capability requirements.  This assessment will inform current capability development efforts by validating concepts and determining their doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) impacts.  Cyber Quest will also serve as a venue to inform rapid acquisition capability requirements and technical risk mitigation.  Army acquisition and capability development proponents can leverage Cyber Quest outcomes to validate selected candidate solutions for future participation in other Army/Joint exercises and experiments (i.e. Cyber Blitz, Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) Live Prototype Assessments (ALPA), Army/Joint Warfighting Assessments (AWA/JWA), the Joint Users Interoperability Communications Exercise (JUICE), etc.).</p>
<p>3.	Cyber Quest 2019 (CQ 19).  The CCoE seeks government, industry, and academic organizations that would be interested in demonstrating Cyberspace Operations, Signal, and/or EW solutions during Cyber Quest 2019, in order to address experiment objectives and focus areas listed below.  Each focus area is aligned with the TRADOC Capability Manager (TCM) who is responsible for developing capability requirements that ultimately yield materiel solutions to the Warfighter.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of The Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), intends to contract with Dealogic LLC, 4th Floor Ropemaker Place, 25 Ropemaker Street, London EC2Y 9LY, UK, on a sole source basis. There is no competitive vendor or regulatory agency that provides these datasets. The proposed Contractor developed and owns the propriety and patented hardware, software and algorithms that are used in these products and support the services specifically required for this acquisition; thereby the proposed source has the sole unique technical and other resources required for this acquisition.
<p>OFR and FSOC require long-term trend information on principal parties, mergers and acquisitions, and trends in the primary syndicated loan market pursuant to monitoring risks across broad market sectors. Dealogic Debt Capital Market Analytics and Loan Analytics are a competitive benchmarking system covering the Global Debt Capital Market and the Global Syndicated Loans Market. Reporting packages include company rankings by industry and region, deal lists, and profiles of individual transactions. Dealogic M&amp;A Analytics database provides a comprehensive view of merger and acquisition activity worldwide, enabling clients to identify macro level trends in the industry. Detailed research applications include assessing performance against competitors and refining the understanding of competitors' banking relationships with clients. The M&amp;A database incorporates details on over 610,000 global M&amp;A transactions since 1995. M&amp;A Analytics transactions include: Public offers, Open market, purchases, Stock swaps, Buy-outs, Privatizations, Recapitalizations, Share buy-backs, and acquisitions.</p>
<p>DCM and Loan Analytics provide comprehensive and real-time coverage of all debt capital market transactions, syndicated loan market transactions, and deal structure globally since 1980 (international and domestic debt transactions, corporate bonds, Asset and Mortgage Backed Securities, preferred stock, global investment grade and leverage financings, including specific markets such as Trade Finance, Shipping Loans, Project Finance). Dealogic M&amp;A Analytics monitors trends in capital allocation, and for monitoring CEO confidence (M&amp;A activity declines when CEOs are less confident). Additionally, Dealogic M&amp;A combines all known public information about the deal onto a comprehensive deal profile, giving researchers a holistic view of historical and current deals to stay abreast of trends across the entire market and analyze transactions, regions, and industries efficiently.</p>
<p>The OFR and FSOC currently use the proposed contractor's brand name product for the continuing mission to deliver an annual assessment of the state of the U.S. financial system, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the purchase order is anticipated to be one 12-month base period with four 12-month options.</p>
<p>The total estimated value of this purchase order will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ANNOUNCEMENT FEDERAL WAGE SYSTEM ALTERNATIVE STUDY 1.0. Description THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ); IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) TO INVITE INDUSTRY AND OTHER POTENTIAL VENDORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ACADEMIA, SMALL BUSINESSES, LARGE BUSINESSES, AND NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE A WHITE PAPER IN RESPONSE TO THE SUBJECT TOPIC. 1.1. The Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) and its component activity, Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS), seeks information from industry, academia, and other organization to explore existing and emerging processes related to the Federal Wage System (FWS). 1.2. The FWS is a uniform pay-setting system that covers Federal Appropriated Fund and Nonappropriated fund blue-collar employees who are paid by the hour. The FWS was established to ensure Federal trade, craft, and laboring employees within a local area who perform the same duties receive rates of pay comparable to prevailing rates in the private sector. Specifically, there are four basic principles: 1.2.1. There will be equal pay for equal work; 1.2.2. There will be relative differences in pay within a local area where there are differences in duties, responsibilities, and qualifications; 1.2.3. Levels of rates of pay will be maintained in line with prevailing rates in the local area; 1.2.4. Levels of rates of pay will be maintained so as to attract and retained qualified employees. 1.3. As such, FWS subject matter experts are seeking sources to provide white papers and demonstrate scalable and cost effective solutions to support the efficient and agile development FWS pay schedules for the Federal blue-collar workforce. 1.4. THIS IS A RFI ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for market research information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, DCPAS is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. 1.5. The proposed identified North American Industry Classification System Codes(NAICS) for this study are 541690, Other Scientific &amp; Technical Research and 541519, Services; 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services; 541519. Information Technology Value Added Resellers. Recommendations for NAICS Code, with supporting rationale, are welcomed and may be included in Part II of your response.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source under FAR 6.302-1

Contractor shall continue to provide intellectual property legal expertise and experience under collaborative guidance and monitoring of the ARPA-E Chief Counsel ("Chief Counsel") and the office of the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property ("DOE Assistant General Counsel").

There is a continued, specialized and critical need for Intellectual Property (IP) Legal Services in the ARPA-E Office of Chief Counsel to: (1) address complicated technology commercialization issues, and any necessary ARPA-E policy changes, (2) mentor/supervised newly-hired DOE IP attorneys who will also support ARPA-E financial assistance award negotiations, and (3) facilitate collection and analysis of IP data from ARPA-E awardees.

The Contractor is intimately familiar with Department of Energy and ARPA-E intellectual property ongoing matters, policies, and procedures.

13. Description of work: 

The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy ("ARPA-E" or "Agency") is a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy ("DOE").  The mission of ARPA-E is to overcome the long-term and high-risk barriers in the development of energy technologies.  ARPA-E facilitates, creates, manages and catalyzes accelerated transformational energy research and development ("R&D") programs and projects to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that reduce energy imports, improve energy efficiency and reduce energy-related emissions.  The goals of ARPA-E, as established by the America Competes Act of 2007, are generally to: (1) enhance American economic security by identifying technologies with the potential to reduce energy imports from foreign sources; (2) reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and improve efficiency across the energy spectrum; and (3) ensure the United States of America remains a technological leader in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.

ARPA-E's mission is highly dependent on intellectual property matters, including acquiring necessary intellectual property rights for government purposes, supporting commercialization of technologies resulting from ARPA-E awards, ensuring US manufacturing requirements, and defending government intellectual property rights in disputes and litigation.  

In providing intellectual property services, the Contractor will apply its expertise and experience as follows under collaborative guidance and monitoring of the ARPA-E Chief Counsel ("Chief Counsel") and the office of the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property ("DOE Assistant General Counsel"): 

a. The Contractor will support the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel to identify, assess, and resolve complex intellectual property issues. The Contractor will advise on intellectual property matters and provide senior experience to support ARPA-E Funding Opportunity Announcements and resulting award negotiations; address complicated technology commercialization issues, and any necessary ARPA-E policy changes. The Contractor will draft documents and provide other assistance to ARPA-E in the field of Intellectual Property, including the crafting of ARPA-E policies, standard contract clauses, preparing presentations, and participating in meetings with staff at ARPA-E.  

b. At the discretion of Chief Counsel, the Contractor may be asked to review and provide recommendations, such as special intellectual property provisions with respect to proposed new solicitations and sole source awards.  

c. At the direction of the DOE Assistant General Counsel, the Contractor will mentor less experienced intellectual property attorneys in the office of the DOE Assistant General Counsel who support ARPA-E.

d. In accordance with relevant ARPA-E policies and procedures, and using material approved by ARPA-E, the Contractor will provide awardees who have been selected to receive awards from ARPA-E with proposed Intellectual Property terms and conditions. The Contractor will interact with proposed awardees with regard to their intellectual property concerns.

e. The Contractor will assist the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel, and their legal staffs, as they provide legal advice to ARPA-E legal and the ARPA-E contracting staff of awardee concerns with respect to those proposed provisions.  

f. During the term of ARPA-E awards, the Contractor will assist ARPA-E legal and contracting and the DOE Assistant General Counsel in the administration of ARPA-E awards.  This may include facilitating the reporting of inventions, the submission of periodic and final technical reports and the close out of awards.  It may also include assisting the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel, in the review and comment on Intellectual Property and Data Management Plans and Subject Invention Utilization reports. 

g. The Contractor will also monitor developments in the field of intellectual property law with particular attention to developments related to the activities of the Federal Government such as the awarding of agreements for the performance of research and development.  The Contractor will work directly with the DOE Assistant General Counsel to keep informed on current DOE policies and procedures with respect to intellectual property, such as the awarding and administration of agreements, reporting of awardee inventions, government employee inventions, maintenance of award and invention records, disposition of intellectual property rights, and the treatment of infringement claims. The Contractor will keep the Chief Counsel apprised of such developments that affect ARPA-E.  

h. At the request of the Chief Counsel or the DOE Assistant General Counsel, the Contractor will assess, and recommend strategies to respond to unusual intellectual property situations.

i. The Contractor will perform other services related to intellectual property as requested by the Chief Counsel or the DOE Assistant General Counsel.

<DESC>VA San Diego Healthcare System will conduct a pre-solicitation site survey for Guest Wifi services throughout the medical center.  The intent of the site survey is to familiarize potential vendors with the facility and requirements, as well as to gain knowledge of options and potential solutions to fulfill the requirements.
Background:  The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking to provide Internet access to Veterans and their guests during their visit or stay at VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHCS). In addition, we are seeking the provision of Internet access for Contractors, visitors, and other guests of our facilities. The proposed Internet access should provide similar levels of service and access to those found in hotels, restaurants, and coffee shops. The network is not subject to the same security policies and restrictions required by Government and regular VA networks.
Internet access for public buildings has become the normal standard of practice. It has been essential in the transitioning of soldiers returning from combat in the current Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts. Injuries from these conflicts have resulted in a generation of Veterans requiring a new set of needs, including long periods of treatment and rehabilitation during which they are relatively isolated in the care environment. Internet access has been seen as a vital part in dealing with those needs because it provides a way for these patients to remain in contact with family, friends, and comrades in their old units. It also provides a means for managing their finances and researching employment and/or educational opportunities online. Today s new Veterans tend to be more computer savvy and have greater expectations for readily available internet connectivity such as they have grown accustomed to at home or on active duty.  The current system is dated with obsolete components.  Additionally, the Medical Center has undergone renovations and guest wifi access is required in these areas.
Existing and additional installations will be at the following locations

<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE, NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>ACTION CODE: SPECIAL NOTICE</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: J - Maintenance, Repair, and Rebuilding Equipment</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Light Scattering Instrument Suite Maintenance</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB645070-20-00124</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: 10 days after posting</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a base year plus three option year sole source contract, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Wyatt Technology Corporation, located in Goleta, CA for Maintenance Services to a Light Scattering Suite.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification is as follows:</p>
<p>Wyatt Technology, the manufacturer of a Light Scattering Instrument Suite, is the sole company that produces an instrument suite with the capabilities to measure particle size, molar mass, particle number, particle shape and particle charge with sample separation. These instruments are highly specialized and contain a myriad of proprietary technologies that require extensive training, knowledge, and experience to appropriately diagnose, service and repair. Wyatt Technologies instrument suite has provided the Biomolecular Measurement Division, with advanced analytical methods in support of NIST's Biomanufacturing Project.</p>
<p>Repairs previously conducted by Wyatt Technology necessitate highly complex equipment and proprietary procedures and may solely be performed in the company's factory. Furthermore, Wyatt Technology's proprietary software has a non-transferable license only available through the manufacturer. As such, Wyatt Technology is the only contractor that can repair and maintain the instrumentation to meet the Governments minimum standards on its five-instrument suite.</p>
<p>Market research has demonstrated that Wyatt Technology is the only source available to provide the maintenance service to meet the Government's requirements on these highly specialized instruments.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will not be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by latishwalker@nist.gov by 11:00am EST 11/18/2019, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 811219 with a size standard of 20.5 Million.</p>
<p>Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfil the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<RESPDATE>120619
<CONTACT>Randall Fernanders, Email mtec-contracts@ati.org
<DESC>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this Announcement for a Request for Project Proposal (RPP) focused on the development of a noninvasive technology for early diagnosis and provider alert of decompensation due to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock in order to inform earlier lifesaving interventions and improve patient outcomes.
<p>Hemorrhage is the leading cause of trauma-related death in both civilian and military populations. More than 33% of prehospital deaths and 50% of deaths occurring within 24 hours of traumatic injury are from hemorrhage. Approximately 50% of combat-related preventable deaths that take place before reaching a military treatment facility (MTF) are hemorrhage related. A study of 4,596 battlefield fatalities from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom determined that hemorrhage accounted for 91% of potentially survivable fatalities occurring prior to arrival at an MTF. This supports the vital need for early detection and intervention.</p>
<p>Technology Focus Area<br />This program is intended to support the development or implementation of technological solutions that can provide early diagnosis information and alert of decompensation due to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock in order to inform earlier lifesaving interventions and improve patient outcomes. Offerors should only propose potential devices and technology solutions that meet the following three criteria:<br />1. Currently be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 or above&nbsp; <br />2. Currently be in development or commercially available; and<br />3. Must be capable of meeting the criteria for use in forward deployed environments and patient transport.<br /><br />The initial Period of Performance (PoP) is not to exceed 1 year.<br /><br />See the attachment for the details of this RPP.</p>
<p>Responses to this RPP in the form of white papers are due no later than December 6, 2019 at 12:00pm ET. The RPP is posted to the MTEC website (mtec-sc.org) and a summary notice is posted on the FedBizOpps (fbo.gov) to notify interested parties.</p>
<p>MTEC membership is required for the submission of a white paper in response to this MTEC RPP. Offerors submitting White Papers as the prime contractor must be MTEC members of good standing by December 3, 2019. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec-sc.org/how-to-join/.</p>
<p>A Proposers conference via webinar will be held for interested parties to have their questions answered by the Government after the RPP is posted. MTEC members will be notified when the Proposer's Conference is scheduled.</p>
<p>For more information about the RPP, please visit the MTEC website (a link is included in the attachment incorporated into this posting).</p>

Justification for Single Source Awards IAW FAR 13.106-1
For
Over Micro-Purchase Threshold but Not Exceeding the SAT ($250K)

Brand Name


Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C255-19-AP-2721

Contracting Activity:
  
Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 15, Kansas City VA Medical Center
Business Operations Service, Veteran Transportation Service
589-20-2-1795-0002   Kiosks - KC

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount: 
 
New requirement
Additional Kiosks for patient use in new centralized check-in area and a replacement of a broken kiosk in the outpatient clinic on the 6th floor.


Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:

The equipment being requested to expand our kiosk use in the new central registration area and replace a unit on the 6th floor.  The kiosks allow patients to do in-person demographic/insurance verification, check in for appointments and apply for travel pay and release of information requests.  This provides faster service for patients and more confidentiality

The current kiosks operate on a hospital wide software program.  The additional kiosks will need to be on the same program as other Kiosks currently utilize at the facility.  This will allow for seamless operation, maintenance and Standardization of Kiosks already in use. Software program is proprietary to VECNA VKioskÂ® Kiosks.

Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:

This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Specifically, only VECNA Technologies brand name.  Based on market research, it was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for this brand name item. Product is available on the Open Market as Small Business Set Aside. 
 
Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the S19 Open Market (FAR13) Award Documentation Form with Abstract  to document price reasonableness.

Overcoming an approximate 33 percent extreme poverty rate is difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This situation is exacerbated by Ethiopia being located in a troubled region, including shared borders with Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Kenya and Somalia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After several years of protests against government oppression, human rights violations, and ethnic marginalization, Ethiopia has embarked on a historic political transition. Since his appointment as Prime Minister in April 2018, Abiy Amhed has announced a series of sweeping political, economic, and diplomatic reforms, and committed to holding free and fair multiparty elections in 2020. These developments, and ongoing reform efforts since then, have created an unprecedented opportunity for a promising transition towards a free, market-based economy and a democratic future.</span></p>

The Mission manages multiple Presidential Initiatives, including Feed the Future (FtF), Global Health (GH), Power Africa, the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Presidential Malaria Initiative (PMI). USAID/Ethiopia&rsquo;s 2019-2024 Country Development and Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) addresses development challenges in the areas of Democracy, Demographics, and Disasters at both the levels of systems and institutions, as well as citizens and communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The CDCS and ongoing programs firmly support the reform efforts underway in Ethiopia, and the USG priorities in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Djibouti, roughly the size of Massachusetts, is home to approximately 1 million people and it is located on the strategic passage between the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. Djibouti&rsquo;s strategic location affords promising economic opportunities as a gateway to much larger markets, such as landlocked Ethiopia. Djibouti is also located in a conflict prone region and hosts military bases from seven countries, including the U.S. and China, which provide security, stability and revenue to the country. However, Djibouti faces a plethora of development challenges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The climate in Djibouti is harsh and 44% of Djibouti&rsquo;s population lives on less than $2 per day. Over forty percent of the population is aged 15 years or younger, and, over 70 percent of this group is unemployed. The country has one of the highest tuberculosis infection rates in the world with cases of multi-drug and ultra-resistant tuberculosis on the rise. Djibouti is an oligarchy and plutocracy with power in the hands of a minority political elite.

<DESC><strong>Contract Delivery Service - Contracting Opportunities</strong>
<p>Contract Delivery Service is a contractual agreement between the U.S. Postal Service and an individual or company for the delivery and collection of mail. The typical service required at the local Post OfficeTM will involve sorting mail for the route, driving to the route, delivering mail and parcels to specified addresses, picking up collection mail, and returning to the Post Office. The contract route will operate six days per week, Monday through Saturday, with possible Sunday deliveries and may include holidays. The carrier is required to use their own vehicle for mail delivery service.</p>
<p>Contract Delivery Service carriers are not USPS employees but are independent contractors who provide service on specific routes. By becoming a contract delivery service supplier for the USPS, you sign on as an independent contractor who delivers and collects mail. You will not be an employee of the USPS, which means you won't be<br />eligible for benefits.</p>
<p>You will be required to pass both a background check and a drug test before the USPS can consider you for a contract delivery service contract. Even though you will not be an actual employee, the USPS is a government agency; which means an extensive screening process is necessary. You also must be 21 years old to be considered for a contractor position. Further reference, detailed instructions, and required documents are included in the solicitation attachments.</p>
<p>Good Luck...and we look forward to your interest in joining Contract Delivery Services</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002 needed for quote.</p>
<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts. CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification. This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended. FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy: adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems. Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /><br />Information Safeguards<br /><br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a. Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b. Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c. Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system. However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /><br />a. Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b. Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c. At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d. Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e. Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /><br />f. Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g. Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /><br />h. Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j. Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /><br />(1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /><br />(2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k. Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l. Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information: facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br />- Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br />- Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br />- Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br />- Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br />- Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br />- Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br />- Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /><br />- Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br />- Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br />- Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br />- Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br />- When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br />- During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification. This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended. FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy: adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems. Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /><br />Information Safeguards<br /><br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a. Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b. Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c. Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system. However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /><br />a. Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b. Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c. At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d. Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e. Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /><br />f. Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g. Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /><br />h. Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j. Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /><br />(1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /><br />(2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k. Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l. Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information: facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br />- Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br />- Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br />- Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br />- Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br />- Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br />- Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br />- Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /><br />- Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br />- Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br />- Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br />- Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br />- When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br />- During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Special Notice - Industry Day Announcement<br /><br />The Army Research Laboratory (ARL), together with the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team (AWCFT or "Project Maven") and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), are hosting the <strong>3rd Annual DoD AI Industry Day</strong> on November 13, 2019 to discuss AI software prototyping activities and future industry participation. All technical businesses engaged in AI/ML are invited to submit information on their capabilities (see website listed below for more information).<br /><br />The ARL Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Basic and Applied Scientific Research added the "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" (AI/ML) topic in 2017 under the Information Sciences Campaign. The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning topic can be found by searching announcement "W911NF-17-S-0003" at Grants.gov or FBO.gov.
<p><br />Over the course of the program, Project Maven and the JAIC have developed a broad range of nascent algorithms using a variety of approaches that have processed tremendous volumes of DoD data to generate a new repository of algorithmic output and metadata. In addition to pursuing innovative ideas to process the raw DoD data, Project Maven and the JAIC are also seeking innovative AI approaches on how to analyze the newly generated AI output and library of AI algorithms.</p>
<p><em><strong>[See Attachment for Chart]</strong></em></p>
<p>In support of Project Maven and the JAIC AI prototyping, the DoD is holding an AI Industry Day focusing on the following areas:<br />1. <strong>Training Data:</strong> Standardizing, cleansing, preparing, and managing data for AI algorithm training, including new labeling techniques and tools for analytics and metrics of training data.<br />2. <strong>Data and Inference Platforms:</strong> New or improved methods for aggregating joint all-domain data sources across all warfighting functions in scalable development and production cloud platforms.<br />3. <strong>Algorithms:</strong> Frameworks and tools for creating AI/ML algorithms, and the algorithms themselves, for AI prototyping against raw data as well as against AI generated metadata.<br />4. <strong>User Interface (UI)/User Experience (UX):</strong> Interfaces to combine traditional, foundational intelligence data and AI; run the AI in inference against raw intelligence data; and provide display, search, and analysis capabilities across all combined data at scale.<br />5. <strong>Integration at the Edge:</strong> New or improved processes and methods for integrating AI/ML within systems at the edge to bring AI/ML to constrained, or RF-denied, computational environments; to include multi-sensor/sensor fusion innovations incorporating AI for on-platform understanding and platform automation.<br />6. <strong>Testing:</strong> New methods to test, evaluate, and determine the effectiveness of AI/ML approaches, including comparisons between approaches.<br /><br />&emsp;<br />The DoD is interested in market research on these focus areas for any data types, techniques, and use cases, with particular interest on the data types, techniques, and uses cases provided below:</p>
<p><em><strong>[See Attachment for Chart]</strong></em><br /><br /><strong>Event and Registration Details:</strong> The one-day Industry Day will consist of presentations in the morning followed by an opportunity for networking and 1:1 panel sessions in the afternoon. Attendees are limited to two (2) representatives per company. Attendees can request an optional 1:1 panel session during registration.</p>
<p><strong>ATTENTION: For those wanting to submit capability briefs/presentations but are unable to participate in a 1:1 panel session or are unable to attend the 3rd Annual DoD AI Industry Day, please submit the presentations via email to osd.pentagon.ousd-intel.mbx.dod-ai@mail.mil no later than 14 November 2019.

<p>1.	Background. Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Executive Order (EXORD) 057-14 (U) established the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence (CCoE) and designated the CCoE Commanding General (CG) as the Force Modernization Proponent for Cyberspace Operations, Signal Communications Networks and Information Services (Signal), and Electronic Warfare (EW); and established the Signal and Cyber Schools.  The EXORD further directed the CCoE to partner with the Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE) for institutional intelligence support to Cyberspace Operations. To that end, the CG directed the establishment of an annual Prototyping Experiment to identify innovative solutions that can close critical capability gaps relating to Army Warfighting Challenge # 7:  Conduct Space and Cyber Electromagnetic Operations and Maintain Communications - How to assure uninterrupted access to critical communications and information links (satellite communications [SATCOM], positioning, navigation, and timing [PNT], and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR]) across a multi-domain architecture when operating in a contested, congested, and competitive operating environment?</p>
<p>2.	Intent. The CCoE will conduct an annual Cyberspace Operations, Signal, and EW Prototyping Experiment called Cyber Quest (CQ) to assess emerging technologies against associated Army capability requirements.  This assessment will inform current capability development efforts by validating concepts and determining their doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) impacts.  Cyber Quest will also serve as a venue to inform rapid acquisition capability requirements and technical risk mitigation.  Army acquisition and capability development proponents can leverage Cyber Quest outcomes to validate selected candidate solutions for future participation in other Army/Joint exercises and experiments (i.e. Cyber Blitz, Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) Live Prototype Assessments (ALPA), Army/Joint Warfighting Assessments (AWA/JWA), the Joint Users Interoperability Communications Exercise (JUICE), etc.).</p>
<p>3.	Cyber Quest 2019 (CQ 19).  The CCoE seeks government, industry, and academic organizations that would be interested in demonstrating Cyberspace Operations, Signal, and/or EW solutions during Cyber Quest 2019, in order to address experiment objectives and focus areas listed below.  Each focus area is aligned with the TRADOC Capability Manager (TCM) who is responsible for developing capability requirements that ultimately yield materiel solutions to the Warfighter.</p>
<p>4.	Experiment Objective #1.  Evaluate how Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) capabilities can enhance Mission Command in support of Multi-Domain Operations.  Supporting Focus Areas are listed below.<br />a.	Cyberspace Situational Understanding (SU) Capability Requirements - TCM Cyber</p>
<p>i.	Ingest, analyze, correlate, and display relevant cyberspace data from multiple Joint, Army, and non-DOD sources into useful, actionable information for the Warfighter.  Focus areas for data sources are:</p>
<p>&bull;	Network topology<br />&bull;	Network configuration<br />&bull;	Network health/status<br />&bull;	Threat intelligence<br />&bull;	Indications and Warnings<br />&bull;	Network Incidents<br />&bull;	Anomalous Network Activity<br />&bull;	Mission Impact<br />&bull;	Force Status.</p>
<p>ii.	Cyberspace SU supporting Army CEMA should correlate and fuse existing and future cyber, movement and maneuver, command and control, intelligence, protection, and fires data to create a depiction, perception, and understanding of cyberspace that enables the delivery of operational effects.</p>
<p>b.	Unified Network Operations (NETOPS) Capability Requirements - TCM Networks and Services</p>

Capabilities should provide the means to rapidly deliver lightweight (small packet size) effects in a tactical environment.</p>
<p>b.	Electronic Warfare Capability Requirements - TCM EW</p>
<p>i.	Electronic Attack (EA):  As a form of fires, EA involves the use of electromagnetic energy, directed energy, or anti-radiation weapons to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying enemy combat capability.</p>
<p>Capability Requirement:  The system must be able to jam radio signals that leverage multiple frequency bands (High Frequency (HF) through Super High Frequency (SHF)), frequency hopping technology, and various waveforms.</p>
<p>ii.	Electronic Warfare Support (ES):  The Army needs a capability to search, intercept, identify, and locate sources of intentional and unintentional radiated electromagnetic energy to enable immediate threat recognition, targeting, and planning in support of future operations.</p>
<p>Capability Requirement:  The capability must identify, categorize, Direction Find (DF), and geo-locate radio frequency signals across multiple bands, (HF through SHF).  EW sensors should be remotely managed by the planning and management tool.</p>

Protect and Extend the Network Capability Requirements - TCM Tactical Radio (TR).</p>
<p>i.	Maintain tactical voice communications in a contested and congested environment.  Identify handheld tactical radios that provide robust and resilient voice communications in a Disconnected, Intermittent, and Limited (DIL) environment.  Although radios should be optimized primarily for voice communications, data capabilities should be maximized whenever possible.  <br /> <br />ii.	Radios should use commercial encryption standards as a minimum, but support secure military communications requirements up to the SECRET classification level when needed.  This can be achieved via an external radio attachment if necessary. The ability to selectively encrypt network transmissions up to the SECRET level will help facilitate partner nation interoperability.  A vendor may pursue a variety of technical solutions to maintain communications in a DIL environment to include, but not limited to, spectrum agility, multi-path transport, and frequency hopping.  Radios need to minimize RF signatures in order to avoid detection.</p>
<p>iii.	Radio performance should exceed that of currently fielded systems (e.g. SINCGARS (Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System), such as range and propagation properties while operating in diverse operational environments.</p>
<p>iv.	Radios need to form a mesh network and demonstrate scalability up to 12 radios.</p>
<p>v.	Extend the tactical network using non-SATCOM capabilities such as aerostats and other rapidly deployable aerial assets.  Capability must provide compatibility with existing waveforms (e.g. SINCGARS, Trellisware Scalable Manet (TSM), etc.), while minimizing Soldier manning and maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>vi.	Identify tactical handheld radio capabilities that can acquire and maintain position and timing in a GPS denied environment.</p>
<p>vii.	Assess vehicle mounted or man portable High Frequency (HF) radios that provide communication resiliency in a DIL environment.</p>
<p>7.	Experiment Design.  CQ19 will accomplish two main purposes: assess emerging technologies against documented Army Capabilities Needs Analysis (CNA) gaps and inform rapid acquisition capability priorities.  The event will present an operational scenario with opportunities to highlight innovative capabilities within a live, virtual, or constructive (LVC) multi-echelon experimentation environment.</p>
<p>a.	Operational Context.  An Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) Tactical Operations Center (TOC), manned with Army and Joint CEMA staff role players, will be placed into a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) wartime scenario overlay to drive at Army and Joint contextual learning demands.  This will enable scenarios to use LVC injects to assess capability learning impacts in an operational relative environment.  The scenarios are not the primary focus of the experiment, nor is accomplishing specific scenario objectives.  The scenario is merely the backdrop that enables the operational assessment of concepts, capabilities, and learning demands in real-time.  Therefore, the intent is to establish operational realism within a No Fear of Failure environment to evaluate innovative concepts and capabilities.</p>
<p>b.	Technology integration.  Industry and government sponsored solutions will be integrated with existing Army capabilities, supported by realistic operational scenarios, and substantive data injects.  Together this environment will drive measurable outcomes and concepts.  The challenges facing our warfighters are too complex to inform concept and acquisition decisions based solely upon a static display or demonstration of capability.</p>

<p>1.	Background. Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Executive Order (EXORD) 057-14 (U) established the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence (CCoE) and designated the CCoE Commanding General (CG) as the Force Modernization Proponent for Cyberspace Operations, Signal Communications Networks and Information Services (Signal), and Electronic Warfare (EW); and established the Signal and Cyber Schools.  The EXORD further directed the CCoE to partner with the Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE) for institutional intelligence support to Cyberspace Operations. To that end, the CG directed the establishment of an annual Prototyping Experiment to identify innovative solutions that can close critical capability gaps relating to Army Warfighting Challenge # 7:  Conduct Space and Cyber Electromagnetic Operations and Maintain Communications - How to assure uninterrupted access to critical communications and information links (satellite communications [SATCOM], positioning, navigation, and timing [PNT], and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR]) across a multi-domain architecture when operating in a contested, congested, and competitive operating environment?</p>
<p>2.	Intent. The CCoE will conduct an annual Cyberspace Operations, Signal, and EW Prototyping Experiment called Cyber Quest (CQ) to assess emerging technologies against associated Army capability requirements.  This assessment will inform current capability development efforts by validating concepts and determining their doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) impacts.  Cyber Quest will also serve as a venue to inform rapid acquisition capability requirements and technical risk mitigation.  Army acquisition and capability development proponents can leverage Cyber Quest outcomes to validate selected candidate solutions for future participation in other Army/Joint exercises and experiments (i.e. Cyber Blitz, Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) Live Prototype Assessments (ALPA), Army/Joint Warfighting Assessments (AWA/JWA), the Joint Users Interoperability Communications Exercise (JUICE), etc.).</p>
<p>3.	Cyber Quest 2019 (CQ 19).  The CCoE seeks government, industry, and academic organizations that would be interested in demonstrating Cyberspace Operations, Signal, and/or EW solutions during Cyber Quest 2019, in order to address experiment objectives and focus areas listed below.  Each focus area is aligned with the TRADOC Capability Manager (TCM) who is responsible for developing capability requirements that ultimately yield materiel solutions to the Warfighter.</p>

<DESC>This pre-solicitation synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to competitively procure services for the establishment of a comprehensive cost avoidance, coordination of benefit, and recovery program that will facilitate the ability of the World Trade Center Health (WTC) Health Program to improve efficiency and control health care costs without compromising quality of care.
<p>A five-year fixed price contract is anticipated with recoupment. Award will be made using a Best-Value Trade-Off approach where technical criteria and past performance will be more important than price.</p>
<p>The Government will release the solicitation, including any subsequent amendments, on the FedBizOpps website or beta.SAM.gov website as required by regulation. The government originally anticipated posting the solicitation approximately 15 days from the original date of posting this notice.&nbsp; However, the government now anticipates&nbsp;a delay in posting&nbsp;and expects to&nbsp;release a draft solicitation or the actual solicitation during December 2019.&nbsp;No telephone or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted. Amendments to the solicitation, if issued, will be posted to the same website. After solicitation release, vendors should regularly access the website to ensure they have all of the amendments.</p>
<p>Registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database will be a prerequisite for receiving an award. For more information on the SAM, refer to the SAM website at https//www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM.</p>
<p>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. This synopsis is for administrative purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.<br />A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached for early review. Offerors will be required to provide a Statement of Work with their proposal. The draft SOO may change slightly prior to posting the solicitation.</p>

<DESC><p>***THIS MODIFICATION IS BEING DONE TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND INTRODUCE A NEW POPULATION OF BEARINGS ITEMS. PLEASE REVIEW THE REVISED QUESTIONS AND RESPOND BY 22 NOVEMBER 2019.***</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ANNOUNCEMENT<br />Defense Logistics Agency - Aviation, Richmond, VA<br />Bushings and Bearings</p>
<p>PROGRAM OVERVIEW:<br />DLA-Aviation, Richmond is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities and experience to provide a strategic support solution for a subset of NSNs under Federal Supply Classes (FSC) 3110, Un-mounted Anti-Friction Bearings; 3120, Un-mounted Plain Bearings; and 3130, Mounted Bearings. The attached list represents NSNs with active requisitions within the last two years. The approximate annual demand value for these parts is $138 million. DLA is considering putting these NSNs on long-term contract, and anticipates a single award proposed contract for up to a five-year term.</p>
<p>Scope of project: This initiative contains 10,266 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) purchased and/or managed by DLA. Of these NSNs, 1,089 are considered priority and compromise approximately 80% of the total projected spend. The NSN list is attached to this RFI. This list possesses the following fields: National Item Identification Number (NIIN), Federal Supply Class, priority flag, Production Lead Time (PLT), OEM cage codes and part numbers, and projected demand quantity over 5 years. Additionally, the NSNs in this list are also pre-sorted by projected spend from highest to lowest.</p>
<p>Please provide your CAGE, Company name, address, and point of contact information.</p>
<p>1. Please indicate if your firm is a manufacturer, dealer/distributor, integrator, or other (explain).</p>
<p>2. Describe your current distribution capabilities (E.g., ability to meet customer requirements, surge capabilities, etc.)</p>
<p>3. In a customer direct (CD) supply arrangement, the contractor forecasts demand, manufactures the NSN or procures it from a sub-contractor, stocks, and ships directly to DLA customers (within the Time-Definite-Delivery standards of either 1 or 3 days). CD items may be shipped in commercial packaging unless otherwise stated. In a DLA-Direct (DD) supply arrangement, the contractor manufactures the NSN or procures it from a sub-contractor and ships to a DLA depot upon completion of the order; time to complete the order is based upon a negotiated production lead-time; contractor does not forecast, stock or ship to the DLA customer.<br />a. Please describe what commercial infrastructure you have in place to support a CD supply arrangement.<br />b. What additional infrastructure do you need (if any) to fully meet this requirement?</p>
<p>4. Provide a percentage breakdown of your current sales to commercial and government customers.</p>
<p>5. Would you consider partnering with another commercial company if you could not provide nationwide service? If so, would your interest be as a prime or subcontractor?</p>
<p>6. Can your company comply with all military product-marking requirements and packaging (E.g., RFID, commercial packaging, MIL STD packing)?</p>
<p>7. Please describe your experience and ability to meet quality and special testing requirements (including, but not limited to: Certificate of Quality Compliance, Product Verification Testing, Production Lot Testing, and First Article Testing).</p>
<p>8. Bearings has specific "Buy American" requirements (see DFARS 225.7009)<br />a. What percentage of your end item bearings are manufactured in US and Canada?<br />b. What percentage of your end item bearings exceed 51% in cost of manufacture in US and Canada?<br />c. What percentage of your bearings meet both requirements outlined in parts a. and b.?<br />d. Describe the quality controls you have in place that ensure traceability in your supply chain</p>
<p>9. (For non-manufacturers only) DLA currently procures many NSNs from a certain set of suppliers. Indicate whether you have existing procurement contractual agreements with these suppliers and any associated subsidiaries:<br />a. Timken Corporation (including subsidiaries such as MPB Corporation)<br />b. SKF Corporation (including subsidiaries such as Kaydon Corporation)<br />c. Kaman Corporation (including subsidiaries such as Kamatics Corporation)<br />d. Schaeffler Group (including subsidiaries such as Barden Corporation)</p>
<p>10. (For non-manufacturers only) Please indicate contractual agreements you have with other major industry suppliers not listed above.</p>
<p>11. Indicate your firm's business size (certified small or large). <br />a. If small business, under which NAICS code(s) are you considered a small business? <br />b. Which small business sub-category does your company qualify under (if any)? (8A, HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman Owned Small Business, etc.)</p>
<p>12. Please answer the following questions on your ability to support for priority and non-priority NSNs:<br />a. What percentage of these NSNs can you support today on a CD basis? <br />b. What percentage of these NSNs can you support today on a DLA Direct (DD) basis? In DD, the contractor has to manufacture or procure the item and ship to DLA-depots. In addition, MIL STD packaging requirements may apply.<br />c. What percentage of NSNs can you support on both CD and DD?<br />d. Is there a percentage of these NSNs you can support on neither CD nor DD? Explain.<br />e. Did you use any information besides the NSN number itself to make these estimates? This may include company specific information (E.g., existing supplier relationships) or NSN level information (E.g., AAC code). If you did, please explain.</p>
<p>13. How would you propose to structure the NSN population (E.g., Would you delete any NSNs? Would you have separate contract terms for a subset of NSNs? Would you create sub-lists based on item characteristics?)<br />a. How would you structure differently (if at all) for First Article Test (FAT), Critical Safety (CSI), and Production Lot Testing (PLT) items?</p>
<p>14. What pricing methodologies (E.g., discrete firm fixed price) would you suggest based on your proposed NSN structure? <br />a. How would this change (if at all) across CD/DD support arrangements or NSN groupings?<br />b. What do you envision the structure of the contract to look like (E.g., number of years, number of line items, etc.)?<br />c. How would you factor in price changes across contract length?</p>
<p>15. Is there any additional information or data that would help you price and prepare a proposal?</p>
<p>16. For shipping, DLA requires the use of DLA/DCMA Vendor Shipping Module (VSM).<br />a. What percentage of your annual government shipments are on VSM?<br />b. Does using VSM inhibit your ability to perform in anyway?</p>
<p>17. Describe your firm's ability to meet the Time Definite Delivery (TDD) standards listed below for high priority orders. Identify previous efforts where you were required to support specific timed deliveries and any risks associated with the effort. Be specific in how your organization met the delivery requirements and mitigated identified risks.<br />a. Priority 01-03 IPG 1-2 Days<br />b. Priority 04-08 IPG 2-5 Days<br />c. Priority 09-15 IPG 3-12 Days</p>
<p>18. Would you consider offering volume based rebates in the contract? If yes, please describe how you would structure it. If not, please explain why.</p>
<p>19. What performance indicators would you suggest for contract evaluation (E.g., on time delivery, material availability, etc.)?<br />a. How should this change (if at all) across CD/DD support arrangements or NSN groupings?<br />b. Are you amenable to penalties for unmet performance? Why or why not?</p>
<p>20. Would you want a ramp up period for this contract?<br />a. If yes, what is a reasonable ramp up period for a contract of this magnitude?</p>
<p>21. How many NSNs would you be able to feasibly price within 90 days? Within 120 days?</p>
<p>22. What additional services would you be able (if any) to provide for this NSN population (E.g., vendor managed inventory, inventory buybacks, other discounts, etc.)?</p>
<p><br />Summary Information:<br />The purpose of this RFI is to allow industry to provide input regarding not only your capabilities relative to the proposed requirement, but also to provide input of your experience and best practices that will allow the Government to develop an acquisition/solicitation strategy. A key part of this is determining feasibility of requisitioning all listed NSNs under a single contract. DLA encourages any suggestions to sub-divide and/or group the NSNs if that would increase the competitiveness of the proposed contracting process.</p>

Airport Technology Research & Development Contract Strategy Industry Day 


The FAA William J Hughes Technical Center is planning an Industry Day on December 3, 2019 to discuss the acquisition strategy relative to the Airport Technology Research and Development (ATRD) program. 


For those interested in supporting the ATRD program, the Industry Day will provide information on the revised approach the FAA has adopted in procuring the services needed to support this program. 


Historically, support for ATRD has been procured primarily through one multi-year contract vehicle. In recent years, the ATRD portfolio has become more diverse and complex. This requires a new approach to effectively support the program. The FAA has identified distinct functional areas, programs, or projects that may be supported separately through various contract mechanisms. The various facets of this program and the specific acquisition strategies intended to be applied to each will be discussed.  


You are invited to join us to hear about the many new opportunities available to industry and academia to support this historically budgeted $33 Million a year program.â¯  


Tours of the ATRD buildings and labs will take place in the afternoon to allow prospective bidders on future procurement opportunities to view the facilities. 


For additional information on the ATRD program, please visit their website:  https://www.airporttech.tc.faa.gov/ 



***THIS IS A FREE EVENT, HOWEVER, YOU MUST REGISTER TO ATTEND***        


The Agenda for the event is attached to this announcement. 
 
 
LOCATION 
William J Hughes Technical Center; Atlantic City International Airport, Egg Harbor Township, NJ 08405

<DESC>This solicitation and any resultant blanket purchase agreement is a stewardship project in accordance with Section 8205 of Public Law 113-79, the Agricultural Act of 2014 and the 2018 omnibus budget bill, in Division O, Title II, Sections 204-207, which amended the stewardship contracting authority. Section 207 extends the maximum duration of stewardship contracts and agreements in areas where the majority of Federal lands are in Fire Regime Groups I, II, and III up to 20 years and allows the agency to give a procurement preference for innovative use of forest products. This grants the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management authority to enter into stewardship contracting projects for up to 20 years with private persons or public or private entities, by contract or by agreement, to perform services to achieve land management goals for the national forests or public lands that meet local and rural community needs. Section 8205 supersedes the authority granted to the Forest Service in Section 347. This is a commercial item acquisition that has been tailored to fit the Government's method of trading goods for services.
<p>DESCRIPTION: The Chewelah A to Z Stewardship Project will result in multiple-award blanket purchase agreements (also known as a BPA with subsequent Call Orders), performance based service spanning approximately fifteen (15) years. The Government intends to make multiple awards to companies/businesses with no minimum guarantees. The intent of these blanket purchase agreements is to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing and/or rearranging the existing fuel loading on selected project areas located on Colville National Forest. It is anticipated that both commercial and non-commercial logging methods may be utilized, but not limited to other complex logging operations and activities. The resultant contracts will be IRTC, IRSC or service call order services with provisions for timber removal.</p>
<p>The Colville National Forest has a need to treat thousands of acres of forest in order to preclude large scale catastrophic fire and/or restore forest woodlands to meet other resource objectives.  The community wants to increase the number of acres treated and examine recreational opportunities, but Forest personnel are at capacity with other priority work.  This contract will allow the project landscape to be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for work activities outlined in the Statement of Work.  The Forest Service will retain all decisional authority, and will select the alternative to be utilized in landscape treatments.  The contractor will then prepare and perform all land treatment activities as ordered by the Contracting Officer.  The Forest Service will inspect all work prior to commencement of the next activity.  The Stewardship End Result Contracting Projects Act was enacted in order to allow the trading of goods for services so overall treatment costs could be reduced to an affordable level.  This project looks to treat unspecified acres in the Chewelah A to Z Stewardship Project area up to a 15 year period at low cost.  For treatments this large there is no in-house capability or alternative to contracting out this work.</p>
<p>The Awardees shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, supervision, tools, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to perform the work in accordance with the specifications and provisions and clauses of the contract. The BPA and call orders issued under this contract may require Service Contract Act wage rates or Davis-Bacon Wage rates or both depending on the specific activities within individual call orders.</p>
<p>Work may include, but is not limited to, meeting requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), unit layout, cruising, marking, road and trail maintenance; work to improve soil productivity, habitat for wildlife or fisheries, or other resource values; prescribed fire support; removing vegetation to promote healthy forest stands, reduce fire hazards, or achieve other land management objectives; restore and maintain wildlife and fish habitat; and control noxious and exotic weeds and reestablish native plant species. Work to be performed will depend upon identified need through project development, product value and available funding.</p>
<p>The Forest Service maintains all inherently governmental functions such as selecting the preferred alternative. No payment shall be made for NEPA services and no stewardship credits shall be accrued for NEPA work. In the event that the preferred alternative is a no action decision, the Contractor will not receive any payment for performing NEPA services. The risk for performing NEPA and pre-treatment services lies with the Contractor.<br /><br />PROJECT LOCATION: The project areas that are included in this solicitation are: Colville National Forest, Three Rivers Ranger District.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled. It is anticipated this conference will be held in XXX 20XX. The exact date, location and time will be designated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Administrative point of contact is Ingrid Anderson at (541) 549-7731 or Carl Ericksen, telephone: (509) 664-9316 or Estimated project value will be determined by each individual call order. NAICS:  113310/115310 SIZE STD: 500 Emp. or $8M or $20.5M depending on work activity.  Stewardship authorities permit the Government to solicit this requirement as Full and Open competition.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is issuing this solicitation for the Consolidated Program Support Services (CPSS) Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)&nbsp;acquisition activity. The CPSS acquisition includes three separate Source Evaluation Boards (SEBs) for the following disciplines:</p>
<p>Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)<br />Project Coordination (PC)<br />Configuration and Data Management (CDM)</p>
<p>This posting includes the&nbsp;Final Request for Proposal (RFP)&nbsp;for CPSS PP&amp;C.&nbsp;The period for questions or comments relative to this acquisition has closed. At this time, the Government is no longer accepting additional questions or comments in relation to the solicitation.</p>
<p>This solicitation is for the CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition which is the follow-on competition for the existing Marshall Integrated Program Support Services (MIPSS) PP&amp;C task order and MIPSS Programmatic Subject Matter Expert (SME) task order.</p>
<p>CPSS PP&amp;C includes PP&amp;C integration, Earned Value Management (EVM), cost estimating, cost analysis, and scheduling. The PP&amp;C integration discipline includes programmatic services supporting managers and decision makers for all aspects of program performance including planning, budgeting, scheduling, cost control, EVM, full cost accounting and budgeting implementation, workforce tracking and analysis, and risk management. The EVM discipline provides support in the area of EVM processes, analyses, and assessments including the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) process per the NASA IBR Handbook, and surveillance and compliance activities per Electronic Industries Alliance EIA-748, Earned Value Management Systems, as well as training of EVM processes and tools. The Cost Estimating and Cost Analysis discipline provides support to program and projects in determining life-cycle costs (LCCs) and provides independent cost assessments of on-going projects. Within the PP&amp;C cost estimating and analysis discipline, support for resource data storage and retrieval library will be required. The Resource Data Storage and Retrieval (REDSTAR) Library is a physical and online storage location for documents containing cost, schedule, technical, and programmatic data on NASA and non-NASA projects, along with studies, cost estimates, and other documents of interest to the NASA cost estimating community. The scheduling discipline provides support in the areas of WBS and schedule development, maintenance, analysis, assessments to include schedule risk assessments, and training.</p>
<p>CPSS SME discipline provides highly qualified experienced SME support to program management including, but not limited to, mentoring, strategic program and project planning and alternatives analysis, program cost and schedule projections, project review, and special studies as requested by the Government.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition is a total small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C contract will provide Mission Service PP&amp;C support for MSFC and Johnson Space Center (JSC); however, it will include an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) component to provide additional PP&amp;C support service and SME support Service to MSFC and any other NASA Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical &amp; Service Support Centers, as identified in subsequent awarded task orders, and at such other locations as may be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. The CPSS PP&amp;C contract period of performance will include a one-year base period and four one-year option periods (to be exercised at the Government's discretion). The Mission Services and IDIQ portions of the contract&nbsp;are anticipated to be firm-fixed-price and the SME IDIQ effort is anticipated to be Time and Materials (T&amp;M). Performance-based deductions will apply to the contract in its entirety.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall possess an active Top Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) by the due date for receipt of proposals. Unpopulated Joint Venture (JV) offerors must have Top Secret FCLs for each member of the JV by the specified due date. Utilizing the CAGE code(s) provided, the Government will verify that the offeror possesses an active FCL using the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency's (DCSA) National Industrial Security System (NISS). No offeror will be considered for award that does not have a Top Secret level FCL in place by the due date for receipt of proposals.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div>Advisory &amp; Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) for housing support management and project manager positions, with performance taking place at Misawa &amp; Kadena Air Bases in Japan.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>

<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div>This purchase will be made under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures as authorized by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). Cherokee Nation Management &amp; Consulting, L.L.C. currently holds a contract with the Department of HHS, which will be terminated on 31 Oct 2019. As such, both Misawa &amp; Kadena Air Bases will have multiple personnel terminated, resulting in a critical mission hindrance. Since this will just be a bridge contract awarded to prevent a substantial duplication of costs to the government and unacceptable delays, an enterprise contract will be awarded in the future for a longer period of performance.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy this agency requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely with the discretion of the Government.&nbsp;</div>
