<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACTING ACTION:
<p>The United States Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate, Multi-Domain Sensing Autonomy Division (AFRL/RYA) intends to enter into a sole source contract with New Mexico Institution of Mining and Technology (NMIMT), Socorro, New Mexico, under the authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center.  The objective of this effor entitled, "Cyber-Physical Research and Testing for Distributive Sensing', is to conduct research and development in a relevant and realistic cyber and electronic warfare (EW) environment for the employment of assets for cyber-kinetic combat effects and Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).  This effort will establish or maintain the existing capabilities at the PTRC in Playas, New Mexico.  This is needed in order to expand current capabilities and meet test range requirements in support of AFRL Sensors Directorate research goals in understanding sensing effects across multiple domains (air, space, cyber, and ground) to include internet of things (IoT) and distributed sensing with traditional and ad hoc configurations.  There is a definite and urgent need for a cyber-kinetic infrastructure to facilitate development, testing, and evaluation of operational cyber, EW, and non-kinetic capabilities in support of national military objectives.</p>
<p>Of particular importance to AFRL/RYA is the research and development of the physics and phenomenology in regards to the interface between the physical world, i.e. objects and the environment, and the cyber realm, i.e. networked devices.  This specifically includes techniques by which objects and events can be sensed or manipulated via transducers and kinetic actuators on cyber-connected devices.  This must also address challenges associated with adversarial or natural denial or degradation of the sensing/manipulation channel, as well as opportunities gained with geometric and spectral diversity of distributed and multi-phenomenology employments.</p>
<p>There are limited test and training opportunities for employment of cyber and EW effects since current military operating ranges are overscheduled or unavailable, and do not possess credible cyber system capabilities to support regular use by cyber and EW customers.  Only the deployment of relevant technology and networks in realistic and representative environments, free from physical or electronic interference, can assure the accurate development of operational cyber capabilities.  An open-air test and training environment where researchers and operators can replicate combat conditions and perform simultaneous operations, cyber-enabled kinetic operations, or physically-enabled cyber operations is a necessity.</p>
<p>The contractor shall establish or maintain existing facilities to expand current capabilities and develop an environment that will eventually serve as an operational range for DoD cyber-kinetic and multi-domain operations.  The facilities and capabilities will include wired and open-air communications and network infrastructure, representative worldwide physical infrastructure, and specialized facilities to support test, training, and operations.  The effort will bring together warfighter requirements, hardware, software, expertise, and best practices to create a reconfigurable and realistic cyber-kinetic environment and range complex.</p>
<p>In order to successfully meet the Government's Objectives under this effort, any potential offeror must:</p>
<p>1.  Have existing facilities capable of performing research and development in the area of realistic cyber and EW environment for the employment of cyber-kinetic combat effects and MDO.  Current facilities must be available for upgrading, through research and development, to the most current and state-of-the art capabilities.</p>
<p>2.  Proposed testing facilities must be remote enough to be free of physical and electronic interference.</p>
<p>3.  Have personnel with the technical background, experience, and intimate knowledge of current capabilities to perform the necessary research and development resulting in the development of test facilities to meet the Air Force's needs as described above.</p>
<p>4.  Have geographical location, such that, the range can cost effectively support cyber-kinetic and EW research, test, and training missions.</p>
<p>AFRL/RYA is not seeking technologies which exist entirely within cyber networks and do not interface with the physical world at this time.  Examples of technologies not sought at this time include offensive and defensive cyber network operations, cyber access concepts, purely-cyber frameworks within the data-link and network-transport layers, and purely-cyber exploits.</p>
<p>Vendors who are capable of providing the effort above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities, including a full description and location of proposed facilities and detailed technical qualifications to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Responses must be submitted to Joseph M. Strehle, Contracting Officer, via email at Joseph.Strehle@us.af.mil.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will not be considered. Other business opportunities for AFRL are available at www.fedbizopps.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact (POC) identified in this announcement.</p>
<p>General Operations Security (OPSEC) procedures, policies and awareness are required in an effort to reduce program vulnerability from successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. The Critical Information List (CIL) will be provided upon request by AFRL/RYOY Information Protection Office. While working on the government installation, OPSEC guidance will be provided by the AFRL/RYOY Information Protection Office.</p>

<DESC>INU TEQ, LLC has a requirement for renewal of annual IADS (Interactive Display and Analysis System) maintenance.<br />INU TEQ intends to purchase the items from Symvionics Telemetry Systems, 190 Sierra Court, Palmdale, California 93550.
<p>Symvionics Telemetry Systems are the only known vendor to provide this maintenance. There would be an extremely large cost impact if any other vendor was to produce the same requirements needed. There are annual reviews of the market to evaluate products that provided similar capabilities. To date none have come close to providing the capabilities provided by IADS. As such, IADS has become the defacto standard for flight test across all of DoD.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30 p.m. local time on October 23, 2019.</p>
<p>Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC><p>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground is posting this  pre-solicitation notice to announce their intent to issue a solicitation  for the Soldier Protection System-Torso Extremity Protection-Modular Scalable  Vest (SPS TEP MSV).</p>
<p>This announcement is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> a request for proposals. Contractors shall not submit proposals in response to this notice.</p>
<p>Proposed Solicitation Number: W91CRB-19-R-0066</p>
<p>Estimated Solicitation Issue Date: On or about 30 August 2019 with all documents, attachments and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov. No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued. Respondents are responsible for obtaining the documentation from the stated website.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this requirement on a full and open basis using the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will provide MSVs as part of the overall SPS TEP system, which provides the Soldier with a lightweight, modular, scalable, mission specific protective equipment system to maximize protection and mobility; allowing field commanders and Soldiers to select the personal protective equipment tier best suited for the planned mission. The MSV component consists of a concealable vest, which includes a cummerbund with two soft armor panels (one front and one back) covered in a camouflage cloth with hook and loop. In addition, MSV includes two side plate pockets with two side soft armor panels, and a tactical outer carrier which includes side plate pocket carriers and shoulder straps. The soft armor panels can be augmented with hard armor protective inserts or can be inserted into the tactical outer carrier that also accommodates hard armor protective inserts. The MSV is the base component of the TEP and it can be configured to provide varying degrees of Soldier protection while reducing weight to the greatest extent possible. The MSV is the basis of the TEP system Tiers 1 through 4.</p>
<p>The scope of work for this requirement includes all procurement and production activities necessary to manufacture the carrier, soft armor ballistic package, and other materials that constitute the SPS TEP MSV. To meet this immediate requirement, the Government intends to award&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;five (5) firm fixed price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts via a competitive acquisition on a best value trade off basis. Subsequent to contract award, delivery orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity procedures described at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 16.505.<br /><br />Period of Performance: Five year ordering base followed by two, 2-year options (additional ordering periods)<br /><br />Contract Minimum includes the Pre-First Article Testing/Technical Data Package and First Article Testing items.<br /><br />Contract Maximum includes production up to 874,000 MSVs (base years 1-5), up to 250,000 (option period 1, up to 250,000 (option period 2) and, any spares and technology insertion (quantities pending).</p>
<p>Draft copies of the&nbsp;Purchase Description and patterns for this requirement may be requested via the FBO website. As part of the request process, vendors must complete the "Draft Access-Vendor Questionnaire" and submit it to the POC listed for this post. Document requests via phone WILL NOT be honored.</p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A").

Example of construction repairs consist of 1 to 3- bedroom homes in need of interior/exterior, roof and roof design, electrical/HVAC, plumbing, and some accessibility related repairs. The period of performance for the initial 20 residential homes is 6 months after issuance of the notice to proceed. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 236118, Residential Remodelers.

All interested parties are responsible to monitor this website for any information or updates regarding this requirement. All prospective contractors must be registered in www.sam.gov prior to award of a Federal contract, failure to register will deem your firm ineligible to receive Federal awards. <br />

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. IT IS A NOTICE OUTLINING THE GOVERNMENTâ€™S INTENT TO CONTRACT ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS WITH NGC.
IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

NAWCTSD has a requirement to provide PORTS technology based Surface Navy training systems.  PORTS is a simulation architecture technology used in the design of many Surface Navy shore-based trainers.
 The current PORTS program is based on the use of a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) simulation engine called the Combined Tactical Training and Analysis System (CTTAS).  CTTAS provides an instructor station and manages the simulation for each specific trainer being developed.  The PORTS/CTTAS architecture forms the core of a family of trainer simulations.  The program is intended to meet immediate and future training needs for the Surface Navy.  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) has ownership of and licensing rights to the CTTAS software. Program requirements are currently being fulfilled utilizing the 2011 PORTS ID/IQC (Contract Number N61340-11-D-0005). The incumbent is Northrop Grumman.

On 4 April 2018, the Government posted a Sources Sought notice, N61340-18-R-0108 for the PORTS ID/IQC to determine the availability of potential comparable sources to provide an equivalent required simulation system.
Four responses were received by the due date of 13 May 2018. Out of the four responses, only the incumbent, NGC, was found to be technically capable of fulfilling the requirement without incurring excessive duplication costs.  In accordance with FAR 5.201, the PCO posted a pre-solicitation notice to FedBizOpps via NECO from 24 August to 10 September 2018, indicating the Governmentâ€™s intent to sole source the subject effort to NGC.  The intent of the notice was to ensure full consideration was given to all potential sources. No response was received to this notice. This effort will be using the market research collected from the N61340-18-R-0108 to proceed with the intention to sole source to NGC.


The follow-on PORTS ID/IQC will not be awarded in time to support FY19 sponsor requirements.
NAWCTSD intends to award a standalone contract for these requirements. This PORTS Delta contract is envisioned to be of limited scope and duration when compared to an ID/IQC. The PORTS Delta contract will be under the same ceiling and sole source award authority as the upcoming ID/IQC.

In accordance with FAR 6.305, the Justification and Approval for this sole source action will be made publicly available within 30 days after contract award.

Small businesses looking for subcontract opportunities are encouraged to reach out to NGCâ€™s Small Business Liaison Office (SBLO) POC, Ms. Vicky Harper-Hall at Vicky.harper-hall@ngc.com .

<DESC><strong>GS-03F-0010R/EP-G14H-00900- On-site Audio Visual and Conference Facility Support</strong>
<p><strong>Intent to Sole Source:</strong></p>
<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current GSA task order with One Diversified LLC, GS-03F-0010R/EP-G14H-00900, as described below.  The subject GSA task order expires on 11/18/2019.  The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award the follow-on services to this GSA task order in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules. Currently EPA is working on the competitive procurement to compete this requirement. However, the new award for follow-on services will not be awarded prior to the expiration date of order # GS-03F-0010R/EP-G14H-00900.  The services under this contract are critical and cannot lapse.  The EPA intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with One Diversified LLC, located at 2975 Northwoods Pkwy, Norcross, GA 30071. A modification will be done to the subject GSA task order to extend services for an additional ten (10) months (11/19/2019 to 09/18/2020) with a two (2) month option period (09/19/2020 to 11/18/2020), until the follow-on order is awarded. During this potential twelve (12) month extension One Diversified LLC will continue to provide on-site audio visual and conference facility support to the EPA facility located at Potomac Yard.</p>
<p>One Diversified LLC is best suited for continuing to provide services and support for the requested potential twelve (12) month extension as they have the necessary personnel, and knowledge of the conference facility at EPA Potomac Yard already in place. Sole sourcing this critical requirement to One Diversified LLC will guarantee continuity of services for the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) while the Government completes the competition and award for the follow-on support services task order. Awarding this requirement to any other contractor at this time would lead to unacceptable delays and could lead to duplication of costs.</p>
<p>This extension to the subject GSA task order will ensure that OPP has continued audio visual and conference facility support. One Diversified LLC has been providing this support to the EPA Potomac Yard facility since 2014. They fully understand the technical work-arounds required to ensure proper connections at this EPA location that allow OPP to host continuous high visibility conferences, meetings, science advisory panels, and national workgroup meetings on a weekly basis.  The Government is not stating that there are no other contractors who can provide these services.  The Government is instead stating that considering the period of performance contemplated within this extension that no other contractor could provide these services without potentially hindering services, increasing costs, and creating unnecessary risks to the Government.  This potential twelve (12) month extension of services is not an attempt by the Government to limit competition to the incumbent contractor but to provide additional time for the award of a follow-on GSA task order. In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(C) - This requirement/extension is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) order that was placed in accordance with FSS ordering procedures. The EPA is committed to continuing the practice of increasing competition in an effort to select the most cost-effective solution in fulfilling the agency's operational goals. The EPA intends to issue a formal Request for Quote (RFQ) on GSA eBuy for this requirement that will be competed as a 100% small business set-aside in the near future.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the direction of the Government.</p>
<p>This notice will be posted for fifteen (15) days.</p>
<p>This intent of this synopsis is to state the Government's intention to sole source this requirement and to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via email to the Contracting Officer listed below within in fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.</p>
<p>At this time phone calls related to this notice of intent are not being accepted.</p>

Sites which are located directly on a highway or six-lane thoroughfare will not be considered if the office is not immediately accessible from both directions of traffic, and traffic devices are not located to control left turning traffic.<br /> <br />Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility (ABAAS), seismic (RP8), and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease.  A fully serviced lease is required.  Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under a lease in Inglewood, CA, that will be expiring.  The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any Federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the General Services<br />Administration (GSA) or their authorized broker representative.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Pittsburgh District, has a requirement for security services at the Shallow Land Disposal Area (SLDA), a formerly used nuclear materials disposal site located in Parks Township, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.
<p>The SLDA is a 44-acre fenced site. The site includes ten trenches containing potentially contaminated waste and soil. The estimated quantities of contaminated waste in the trenches range from 23,500 to 36,000 cubic yards. Uranium and thorium contaminated wastes consist of process wastes. Equipment, scrap, and trash from the nearby Apollo nuclear fuel fabrication facility were disposed of in the SLDA trenches between 1961 and 1970. The uranium in the trenches is present at various levels of enrichment ranging from highly depleted to highly enriched. Americium and plutonium, whose presence is attributed to storage of equipment used in adjoining Parks Facility, have been detected in surface soils in the vicinity of trench 10. Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (predecessor of current owner BWX Technologies (BWXT)) previously conducted the disposals according to Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) regulations. BWXT currently holds a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) License for its activities at SLDA. A portion of that license is currently being held in abeyance to allow the remediation of the site by the USACE. The NRC license requires BWXT to properly maintain the site to ensure the protection of workers and the public. While the license is held in abeyance, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for protection of workers and the public with respect to the site.</p>

<DESC>A. SYNOPSIS<br />This is a request for information. It is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. Release of this information should not be construed as a commitment to procure items discussed or to incur costs for which reimbursement would be required or sought. <br />The purpose of this notice is to identify:<br />1) Potential Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) pricing structures to increase transparency as well as control and reduce costs for the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program;<br />2) PBM services for administering and operationalizing the WTC Health Program pharmacy benefits; and <br />3) Potential clinical benefits that PBMs may be able to provide to help improve cost saving measures and formulary management.
<p>B. BACKGROUND<br />On January 2, 2011, the President signed into law the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act). The Act established with the Department of Health and Human Services a program to be known as the World Trade Center Health Program (WTC Health Program). The WTC Health Program provides medical monitoring, screening and treatment for responders and survivors of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Responders include a worker or volunteer who provided services in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. Survivors include persons that worked, lived, or attended school, childcare, or adult day care in the New York City disaster area, who were adversely affected by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City. As of December 31, 2018, there are a total of 74,107 responders and 18,921 survivors enrolled in the Program. In order to enroll in the Program, survivors and responders must meet certain criteria described in the Zadroga Act.</p>
<p>The WTC Health Program is a limited benefit program, meaning that treatment is only covered for health condition for which exposure to airborne toxins, hazards, or any other adverse conditions resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. There is a list of applicable WTC-related health conditions that must be diagnosed by a WTCHP provider, and certified by the Program in order for the member to receive treatment. In order to qualify for treatment, an enrolled member must meet certain exposure, latency, and symptom onset requirements for conditions. A range of conditions are covered including mental health, aero-digestive, and cancer. There are currently seven (7) Clinical Centers of Excellence in the NYC metro area, and one Nationwide Provider Network that administer the benefits to Members. The complex limited structure of the Program poses a unique challenge when managing a members pharmacy benefits. The Program must ensure that drugs are not being covered for conditions not related to the WTC Health Program, while also not impeding access beyond appropriate limits.</p>
<p>C. CURRENT PBM SERVICES</p>
<p>The current Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) specializes in worker's compensation benefits, and the pharmacy benefits are operationally administered in a way that is similar to worker's compensation. The PBM is responsible for adjudicating pharmacy claims, implementing the pharmacy formulary and point of sale edits, and providing customer service to stakeholders. They also provide and manage the retail pharmacy network, which must be abundant in all 50 states and US territories, as well as a home delivery/mail-order and specialty drug pharmacy. In 2018, the WTC Health Program pharmacy claims expenditures were $97,380,692.29 with 388,104 total claims and 24,624 members utilizing pharmacy benefits. There is significant home delivery use within the program with home delivery penetration at 37.11% in 2018.</p>
<p>The PBM provides an external pharmacy adjudication web portal that shows prescriptions processed in real time and routes point of sale edits to the appropriate party, such as the CCE/NPN staff, PBM clinical or customer service team, or CDC. The Program works closely with the PBM to manage operations and processes related to pharmacy benefits and adjudication rules. The PBM also provides some clinical staff to consult on formulary decisions and prior authorizations.</p>
<p>The PBM also provides a pharmacy claims data system that allows stakeholders to run a variety of reports on pharmacy claims for quality assurance purposes including data analysis for clinical reviews, cost analysis, program and formulary decisions. In addition, the PBM provides quality assurance and fraud, waste, and abuse reports monthly, quarterly, and ad hoc. These include recommendations for cost savings. PBM staff provide general support to the WTC Health Program for clinical, operational, and customer service projects and daily requests.</p>
<p>The PBM is also responsible for all customer service related to pharmacy for both members, pharmacies, and CCE/NPN clinical staff. Additionally, the PBM is responsible for distribution of pharmacy cards, and other types of communications developed in conjunction with the WTC Health Program.</p>
<p>D. WTC HEALTH PROGRAM INTERACTION ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The WTC Health Program oversees all pharmacy operations and develops pharmacy program policies. The Program leads a Pharmacy and Therapeutics Forum quarterly where clinical decisions are presented to stakeholders regarding drug coverage and coverage changes. This is done with the support of the PBM. This process includes implementation of policy changes such as communication to Members. The Program also manages multiple contractors that impact pharmacy. Standard Operating Procedures for pharmacy benefits are also developed by the Program and PBM. Member issues, when escalated, are brought to the Program for resolution. The WTC Health Program conducts and overseas all quality assurance activities related to prescription processing, customer service, and other types of processes. For additional information please consult the World Trade Center Health Program Administrative Manual.</p>
<p>E. REQUESTED INFORMATION<br />1. Please describe how your company would propose operationalizing a limited health benefit by ensuring members are only able to receive medications appropriate for their certified condition through the Program. <br />2. What types of clinical expertise, formulary management, and formulary cost savings resources could your company provide? <br />3. Please describe your point of sale edit systems and prior authorization procedures. If changes are made to the formulary, are there limitations in how this would be implemented in the system (ex: If a PA is removed off a drug, do prescriptions that previously had a PA still require a PA to process?). <br />4. What types of contracted price rates does your company utilize? How can your company increase transparency in the cost of medications and reduce prescription costs for the WTC Health Program? <br />a. Do you have pricing alternatives to using Average Wholesale Price (AWP), such as pass through pricing or FSS pricing etc.? <br />b. How are your pricing structures used for all services, including, but not limited to, processing medications, IT system modifications needed by the Program, customer service/call centers, printing and mailing of member communications, web updates for a home delivery portal, generating reports, and other services required of a PBM outside of managing the formulary and providing medications?<br />c. Can you provide a recommended pricing set-up for a federal PBM contract?<br />5. Please describe your data systems and reporting capabilities on drug utilization and cost projections. Do you have a data system for external users to access?<br />6. Does your PBM offer home delivery, specialty, or other types of services for pharmacy? Is there a cost incentive to these services? <br />7. Do your systems allow you to process coordination of benefit (COB) claims, whereby the member's primary insurance is billed first, and the WTC Health Program could be billed secondary at the point of sale? <br />a. Does your PBM offer other services to facilitate coordination of benefits for those patients that do have primary insurance on record? <br />b. Can your systems store and/or block an individual sale when a primary insurance was used in a prior transaction but not used in a subsequent transaction for a member? <br />8. What type of customer service support does your PBM offer for members, pharmacies, and physicians? (Ex: 24 hour customer service line, dedicated team, etc.)<br />9. Would your PBM provide communication services, such as development and mailing of pharmacy cards, and other types of member communications?<br />10. Have you performed similar services in the past for government or other entities? Please provide a list and brief description. Please included contract numbers for federal government past performance, if applicable.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), on behalf of the Emergency Management Institute (EMI), has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit market research information from industry.
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a Solicitation, or an indication the EMI will contract for the items contained in the RFI. This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.

If a Solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities, website www.fbo.gov, at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that Solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement.

<p>Capability Information<br />Vendors capable of and interested in providing a LCMS, the associated support, and hosting that will be used to manage and develop training to emergency management partners and the general public should review the attached PWS and provide a description of the capabilities mentioned within.

Dun &amp; Bradstreet DUNS number.<br />3. Contact information (address, telephone, e-mail, website address).<br />4.

<p>Vendor comments may be incorporated and used to develop the final PWS as well as the solicitation.</p>

<p>The office space, elevator and the parking must be accessible twenty four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.</p>
<p>Offered space shall not be located within 640 feet of any facilities involved with hazardous materials transportation/storage facilities.  This includes railroads tracks that transport these materials.</p>

<p>Other locations offered:            	$_12.00_ per ABOA SF</p>
<p><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 19-REG05.  In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.  <strong>The May and June open periods will be used for this procurement to collect offers.</strong></p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the requirements in this FBO advertisement and in the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers.  Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.</p>
<p>The offered space must comply with the requirements in this FBO advertisement and RLP 19-REG05 and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease.  The Lease and all documents that constitute the Lease package can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<p>&bull;PILES - DAMAGE AND REMOVAL</p>
<p>1. Damaged or Displaced Piles: Piles that are cracked, split, or otherwise damaged beyond repair must be removed and replaced with new piles in accordance with these specifications, unless otherwise directed in Work Plan. Piles that have been moved from vertical position and are not damaged must be straightened to an upright position. A pile that remains loose after straightening may indicate that the portion of the pile located beneath the water surface has been damaged or decayed and will require removal and/or replacement. Any damage observed on a pile that was to be straightened to an upright position shall be reported in the Marker Records.</p>
<p>2. Pile Removal: Steel, timber, composite or concrete piles shall be removed by the Vendor at the locations indicated in the Work Plan. Wood piles are typically 10" diameter, and composite piles are typically 8" - 10" in diameter. If they exist, steel and concrete pile diameters will be obtained by FWC and described in the Work Plan, however, it can be assumed they have been drilled or jetted into the bottom. The Vendor shall make every effort to remove each pile in its entirely by pulling or using a jet pump. Should the Vendor be unable to remove a pile, it may be cut, but the cut must occur at or below the mud line. If removal by cutting is required, the Vendor shall record the location and certify that the pile was cut at or below the mud line.</p>
<p>SIGN PANELS</p>
<p>Sign panels must be installed as indicated on the waterway marker details with piles to be shortened as dictated by the normal mean high watermark in the area of installation unless otherwise specified in the Work Plan.

<p>2. Signs: Bi-annually, sign panels are flipped at various locations of the state in order to post seasonal regulatory zones.</p>
<p>BIRD NEST TRIMMING/REMOVAL<br />In coordination with FWC, the Vendor may be requested through a Work Plan to trim or remove an inactive osprey nest from a waterway marker. FWC will secure all required authorizations and provide the Vendor with documentation of those authorizations and the FWC policies pertaining to osprey nest removals. Additional information on nest removal can be found at http://myfwc.com/media/290143/OspreyPolicies2010.pdf.</p>
<p>BIRD DETERRENT DEVICES<br />Nesting and resting birds cause damage to waterway markers while their nests and/or droppings oftentimes obstruct the sign panel message from view. Bird roost inhibitors, such as polycarbonate or steel "bird spikes," may be secured (using nails, screws and/or adhesive) to the top of marker cross members or buoys to deter birds from nesting or resting. As part of a Work Plan, the Vendor may be asked to install bird deterrent devices to the entire length of the top marker cross member or the tops of buoys. Deterrent devices will be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The Vendor may be required to purchase bird deterrent devices of a specific type for a project, and FWC will compensate the Vendor on a cost-reimbursement basis upon submission of the actual invoice. The Vendor is responsible to provide any adhesive or other fasteners, as applicable, and provide all other materials and equipment needed for construction and/or installation of bird deterrent devices.</p>
<p>TAPE APPLICATION<br />When specified in the work plan, tape application includes applying corrective tape to correct sign panel messages, permits or rule numbers. Tape will be provided to the Vendor by FWC. Prior to applying tape, sign panels will be thoroughly cleaned before applying tape. Tape will be applied so that it matches orientation of sign panel message and is not to be applied in such a manner that it obstructs other verbiage or symbols on the sign panel.</p>
<p>ANNUAL/BI-ANNUAL INSPECTION<br />Work Plans may include a request for the Vendor to establish an inspection schedule for each marker owned and/or managed by FWC within a given geographic area. This may include any or all markers under management of FWC, such as private aids to navigation, piles, sign panels and buoys. "Inspection" includes a thorough check of all marker hardware (assessing for wear, checking the buoy connection to the down line or chain, and replacing hardware, as needed) and performing basic maintenance according to the specifications identified in the Work Plan. The Vendor shall complete and submit Marker Records which identify the results of the inspection and all work performed to help FWC determine future needs for marker replacement.</p>
<p>CLEANING OF MARKERS<br />Markers which are soiled with fecal matter, marine residue, marine growth, mold, mud, other matter or graffiti will be cleaned as requested in the Work Plan. The Vendor may use a high pressure washer and/or appropriate cleaning compounds. The Vendor shall use methods that will not damage reflective sign panels, tape, fasteners, piles, or other marker elements. Any chemicals, soaps, or other materials must be free of phosphates, ammonia, sodium hypochlorite, chlorinated solvents, petroleum distillates, or lye. Cleaners must also be biodegradable and must be safe for the marine environment in accordance with state regulations. The materials used shall not be abrasive or in any way damage, mar, or reduce the reflectivity of the marker. The Vendor will document, in the Marker Records, the cleaning compound(s) used and the manufacturer's certification demonstrating conformance with the requirements of this specification.</p>
<p>When soiling persists following washing and rinsing, the Vendor shall repeat the cleaning process. If pressure washing systems are used, the Vendor shall protect reflective coverings and other elements which could be damaged or become dislodged during cleaning. If a subsequent cleaning process fails to remove soiling, the Vendor shall note this along with the cleaning equipment and methods used in the Marker Records so an assessment can be made as to potential marker replacement. Any damage caused by cleaning methods employed by the Vendor shall be repaired at no cost to FWC.</p>
<p>PATON PLATFORM AND LANTERN/LIGHT SYSTEM<br />The Vendor may be assigned to install, replace, maintain, inspect or repair private aid to navigation systems and marine solar flashing beacon lantern systems owned and/or managed by FWC. Vendor will be required to ensure that each lantern system is tested and set to the appropriate flash pattern as directed by FWC. Vendor will properly dispose of both the platform and solar beacon system, if requested by FWC. The lanterns will be provided by FWC and will be fully integrated, self-contained, waterproof solar LED marine lantern and battery systems appropriate for application in the particular project.</p>
<p>FLOOD ZONE MARKERS<br />There are a limited number of waterway markers owned by FWC which post regulated areas during flood stage. These markers may incorporate a solar powered flashing beacon assembly and an electronic switch. The Vendor may be tasked with installation, maintenance or repair of these markers, which often use longer piles to accommodate flood stage water levels. Any required replacement light assemblies and switches will either be provided by FWC or the Vendor may be asked to purchase the light assemblies and switches of a specific type for a project. In this scenario, FWC will compensate the Vendor on a cost-reimbursement basis upon submission of the original invoice.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>DISPOSAL OF REMOVED ITEMS<br />All items removed must be properly disposed of in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and ordinances, and the items and method of disposal will be identified in the Marker Records.</p>

<DESC>The Product Lead, Common Hardware Systems (CHS) with Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Tactical (PEO C3T) will host a Tactical Hardware Technical Exchange in conjunction with their Program Review to discuss Army product office needs for future tactical commercial information technology (IT) hardware requirements. This technical exchange occurs on Tuesday, 28 January 2020 on Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland at the Top of the Bay. All vendors wishing to be a part of this governmental technical exchange must register no later than 5:00p.m. (EST) Tuesday, 21 January 2020.
<p><br />The goal of the event is to assist industry partners and government product offices in identifying and aligning their efforts with future Army tactical commercial IT hardware requirements. The core audience for this exchange is governmental product, technical, and logistics leads and their representatives. Supporting industry partners should provide highly flexible, cost effective, common, and simplified non-developmental commercial IT hardware solutions improving battlefield interoperability and connectivity. CHS promotes solutions that fit into the Converged Mission Command Network, that align with Army Capability Sets, and which enable improvements over time.</p>
<p>The Army encourages DoD Approved Product List and IT companies' participation in this unique forum, centering on innovative capabilities enabling the Army's use of expeditionary and intuitive common hardware (non-ruggedized and ruggedized) solutions: servers, computers / peripherals, networking devices, cables / accessories, operational transit cases, network storage, radios, modules, kit assemblies, adaptors, vehicle intercom systems, ancillary / consumable items, and plotters.</p>
<p>Registration INFORMATION is available at this link: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/common-hardware-systems-program-reviewtechnical-exchange-tickets-74274714671?aff=erelexpmlt</p>
<p>Special government emphasis will be given to Army Capability Sets. Those tactical hardware solutions that contribute to smaller, lighter, faster communications systems; easy to use devices; multiple route connectivity options; and security / management systems are core.</p>
<p>C5ISR product/program offices will participate in an annual CHS Program Review throughout the day at the venue. Vendor roadmap times will be scheduled from 0900 to 1400 to provide government program representatives with a better understanding of emerging commercial IT hardware products that could address future program gaps and challenges. Government / vendor private meeting rooms will be available if government representatives wish to explore further specific technology ideas.</p>
<p>The US Army will make every effort to hold the Tactical Hardware Technical Exchange at the times, dates and locations specified. The US Army holds the right to cancel and /or change session event times, dates and locations under certain conditions. These conditions usually include, but are not limited to: inclement weather, event venue cancellation or rescheduling, speaker cancellation or rescheduling, and insufficient number of participants for the event. The US Army holds the right to cancel the event for any reason up to and including the day of the event. In the event that the US Army must cancel the event, the US Army will not be responsible for costs incurred in preparation for the event. In the event of predicted inclement weather, a decision will be made by 5pm on the prior day. If the event is cancelled, the notice will be posted on this website and an email will be sent to all registered participants.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command - Chemical Biological Center (CCDC CBC), Rock Island, IL, on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Policy via its Manufacturing Resiliency and Assurance Office, and Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment Program (10 U.S.C. &sect; 2508), in conjunction with Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), manages the Cornerstone Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b. Cornerstone was architected to create a broad-based, flexible and enduring public-private consortium focused on strategic strengthening of the U.S. Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and provides a strong complement to the mandates in Presidential Executive Order 13806.
<p>ACC-RI, on behalf of CCDC CBC and the US Army Corps of Engineers Engineer Research and Development Center, intends to issue a competitive Cornerstone Initiative Request (CIR) for High Performance Materials and Structural Systems on or after 21 October 2019, with an estimated closing date of 10 business days after issuance. The CIR for High Performance Materials and Structural Systems is restricted to Cornerstone consortium members.</p>
<p>The CIR will solicit white papers for one (1) fixed amount OTA with incremental payments made upon completion of specific milestones. The base period of performance is estimated to be two years, with options extending to a total period of performance of three to six years. A non-competitive follow-on production OT may be awarded following a successful prototype.</p>
<p>The objective of this effort focuses on development of advanced lightweight materials and structural systems, specifically designed for logistic, mobility, and energy supply chain enhancements. Tasks include the development of enhanced modeling and simulation techniques and computational analysis tools to support the military engineering missions of force projection, maneuver support, and force protection. The effort will focus on the areas of advanced materials and multi-scale modeling development for next generation force projection and force protection systems including concrete, composites, and hybrid material systems, multi-scale modeling of materials, and new formulations for capturing cumulative material damage from dynamic loads. Strategic materials of interest include cementitious and cementitious composite materials, hybrid thermoplastics, thermosets, nanocellulose, metals, geomaterials, and composites thereof. Final objectives are to decrease logistical costs, increase mobility, and improve the performance and advanced materials for force projection and force protection. Performance properties of interest include traditional structural design properties and Army-centric properties such as blast and ballistic protection.</p>
<p>The CIR for High Performance Materials and Structural Systems will be communicated to the Cornerstone consortium and companies with pending applications via email. Entities are required to have begun the membership process for their proposal to be reviewed. Entities must be members of the Cornerstone consortium, with a signed Cornerstone Consortium Management Agreement, to be awarded this OTA task. Contractors may obtain Cornerstone registration information by visiting the Cornerstone website: <br />http://ibasp-public.ria.army.mil/cornerstone/</p>
<p>Interested parties should stay alert for any changes that may be published to this FBO posting. Please email all questions and responses to the following mailbox:<br />usarmy.ria.ccdc-cbc.mbx.cornerstone-ota@mail.mil</p>
<p>This Special Notice is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a CIR or an obligation on behalf of the U.S. Government. Issuance of this Special Notice is not a guarantee of a future CIR or an award and is not a commitment of any kind by the Government.</p>

The CIR for Energetic Material Synthesis is restricted to Cornerstone consortium members.</p>
<p>The CIR will solicit proposals for one (1) expenditure-based OTA with incremental payments made upon completion of specific milestones. Period of performance will be up to five (5) years. A follow-on production OT for each compound of interest will be pursued upon successful prototype completion.</p>
<p>The Government requires high energy formulations for novel and legacy warheads. In order to meet these requirements, novel compounds need to be scaled up and converted into energetic formulations by utilizing commercial technologies for defense purposes. The prototypes for this initiative are the novel energetic and inert compounds, and high energy formulations developed utilizing these compounds. These prototypes address proof of concept and demonstration of technical and operational utility of existing DoD munitions and enhanced developmental warheads to meet Army cross functional team goals.</p>
<p>The CIR for Energetic Material Synthesis will be communicated to the Cornerstone consortium and companies with pending applications via email.

Objectives:
There is a need for an acuity/patient classification system to match the changing care needs of the patients to the appropriate staffing level based on the patient condition and the amount of nursing required to manage the care of each patient.

Hospital based staffing requires a 24-hour coverage a day, 7 days a week.  Direct Care staff work a variety of shifts that require an hourly rate increase, and contract/agency and travel nurses all have different compensation requirements. Therefore, a Staff Scheduling system needs to accurately correlate and calculate time and cost by work unit, type of staff, and pay variables. 

Nurse executives need data to plan for current and future staff needs and costs; this system gives them the tools to help manage their workforce. Multiple standardized reports are needed as well as the ability to create ad hoc reports.

Justification:
An integrated system and automated data extraction tools that are necessary to effectively assign staffing resources, monitor standards of care, and pulled from systems that already have the data entered in them to avoid duplicate effort and to feed the other downstream data systems. For example, there is a need for an acuity/patient classification system to match the changing needs of the patients to the appropriate staffing level based on the patient condition and the amount of nursing required to manage the care of each patient.

Hospital based staffing requires 24-hour day coverage, 7 days a week. Nursing hours worked frequently involve a variety of shifts that require an hourly rate increase; in addition, contracts/agency nurses all have different compensation requirements. Therefore, a resource management system needs to accurately correlate and calculate time and cost by work unit, nurse position type, and pay variables. Nurse Executives need data to plan for current and future staffing needs and costs which requires tools to help them manage their workforce. Multiple standardized reports are needed as well as the ability to create reports.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>Background: <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) is required by law (10 U.S.C. &sect; 1074g) to establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System (MHS) which includes the purchase pharmaceutical agents. The law and implementing regulation (32 CFR Section 199.21) describe the process by which the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee will consider the relative clinical effectiveness and relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class in recommending the selection of agents for the DoD Uniform Formulary (UF) and, for cost sharing purposes, the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, Basic Core Formulary (BCF), Extended Core Formulary (ECF), or non-formulary (NF). Prior to the scheduled P&amp;T Committee meeting, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for pharmaceutical agents within Drug Classes identified for placement on the UF has been issued to obtain quotes from industry. The Defense Health Agency may award Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreements (UF BPA) and the Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program Agreements (UF ADP) based on the UF decision. This process is described in the attached RFQ.
<p>P&amp;T COMMITTEE MEETING: November 2019: The following drug classes/subclass and newly approved agents will be reviewed: <br />Antidepressants and Non-Opioid Pain Syndrome Agents, SUB CLASS: Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors - Drizalma<br />Pulmonary-2 Agents, SUB CLASS: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - Duaklir Pressair<br />Binders Chelators Antidotes Overdose, SUB CLASS: NA - Gvoke <br />Anticonvulsants-Antimania Agents, SUB CLASS: NA - Nayzilam<br />Parkinsons Agents, SUB CLASS: NA - Nourianz<br />Diabetes Non-Insulin, SUB CLASS: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP) Receptor Agonists Oral - Rybelsus<br />Diabetes Non-Insulin, SUB CLASS: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP) Receptor Agonists - Rybelsus<br />Migraine Agents, SUB CLASS: Triptans - Tosymra<br />Sleep Disorders, SUB CLASS: Wakefulness Promoting Agents - Wakix</p>
<p>RFQ: The RFQ, including UF BPA and UF ADP appendices are attached herein. <br />There is no pre-proposal teleconference. Rather, questions shall be submitted via e-mail to the Request for Quote (RFQ) Point of Contact stated in Part 2.3, no later than the date stated in Part 2.4. Also, responses to Part 3.4 is required.</p>
<p>POCs: Part 2.3 of the RFQ. <br />For additional information, search DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee at http://www.health.mil/POD</p>

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13px">The Health and Comfort Packs (HCP) are designed to provide a means for forward area troops to acquire the everyday non-food necessities that are required for their health and comfort when the exchange system or local stores are not available to them. The contents listed here are the components that were procured on the last contract. Based upon field surveys, changes may be made in future procurements. If changes are made, they are usually in size of component or due to popularity of a new item, but the basic list of items generally remains the same. There are three types of HCP's, Type I, II and III. Type I- 58 lbs and 3.3 cube (12 cases/pallet), Type II- 18 lbs and 1.9 cube (16 cases/pallet) , and Type III- 22 lbs and 2.2 cube (16 cases/pallet).</span>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Â§6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Â§6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Â§6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) â€œPrincipal,â€ for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerorâ€™s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>

These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</p>
<p>(e) <br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br /><br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</p>
<p>(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</p>
<p>(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either (1)by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2)terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</p>
<p>(i) <br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time-<br /><br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</p>
<p>(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</p>
<p>(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</p>
<p>(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</p>
<p>(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1)at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2)within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>Alternate I (July1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs(g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.</p>
<p>(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either (1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or (2)may terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.</p>
<p><br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1)at no increase in any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in any target price, or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2)within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the total final price as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.</p>
<p>Alternate II (July1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.</p>
<p>(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either (1)by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or (2)terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.</p>
<p><br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1)at no increase in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2)within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l) (2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a<br /><br />final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>

<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.48 per hour or $179.20 per week or $776.53 per month</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.18 per hour, or $167.20 per week, or $724.53 per month*</p>
<p>*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA-covered contract also covered by EO 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, 4 weeks after 10 years, and 5 weeks after 20 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p><br />THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt<br /><br />computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.<br />Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br /><br />A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1), dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE<br />RATE, Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **<br />Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed<br /><br />by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.<br /><br />When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).</p>

<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is an Unrestricted Solicitation. As a result for this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, the Coast Guard is seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for Teardown, Test, and Evaluation fee, No Fault Found fee, Beyond Economical or Return "As Is" fee, and the commercial aircraft component repair/overhaul services price prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. Solicitation number 70Z03820QL0000004 is issued as a Special Notice of Intent to Award to the Component OEM. It is anticipated that a non-competitive Sole Source Purchase Order shall be awarded as a result of this notice. It is the Governments belief, that only the OEM or a previously established Capable Repair Vendor in possession of the required OEM Data has the required proprietary technical and engineering data to successfully provide these repair services. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within (3) calendar days from this notice posting. The information submitted must include a letter from the OEM verifying the Offeror is an authorized service distributor and verifying the OEM will supply only genuine OEM parts. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2019-06.
<p>Any vendor, except the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Production Approval Holder (PAH), repairing Coast Guard Aircraft Components MUST be FAA 145 certified and perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work at their company's FAA certified facility. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the repair or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists. Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their service data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS Engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Charles.J.Rice@uscg.mil for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 488190. The Coast Guard intends to issue a Not-To-Exceed post assessment firm fixed price repair/overhaul order to the Aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the Component Production Approval Holder (PAH), or a PAH Authorized and Capable Service Facility, for repair/overhaul using OEM Proprietary Data for the following item(s):<br /><br />3 Each NSN 1560-01-HS2-1111, P/N 35-11021-0005C01, WING TIP ASSY L/H (Modify to add Friendly Light) <br />3 Each NSN 1560-99-991-3092, P/N NB0075-2760, CONTROL THERMAL (Test and Recertify IAW OEM Specs)</p>
<p>Sole Source Justifications (J&amp;As) and Solicitation Information Packet is attached to this solicitation. The Coast Guard does not own nor can provide the OEM's Service Manuals, Service Bulletins, or Proprietary Data. Unless the OEM, with their quote, vendors must provide a copy of the first page of the current OEM Manual or Service Reference, and in their quote make reference to it (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789").

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>
<p>Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 7. <br />USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR)</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

<h1 style="mso-list: none"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The 402nd Aircraft Maintenance Group (AMXG) at Robins AFB, GA, has a requirement for a turnkey Digital Dectector Array (DDA) within B144. The DDA must use the latest in digital scanning and DDA design to optimize the F-15 vertical as defined in F-15 T.O. 1F-15C-36, pages 4-136 through 138, F-15 T.O. 1F-15C-36 page 3-4, and C-5 T.O. 1C-5M-36: page 3-17. The speed from beginning to end including start up and processing time to store information collected from the DDA shall be under four (4) hours for any single task listed in the technical order above. This will be a one-time supply requirement.</span></h1>
<h1 style="mso-list: none"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">At a minimum, the following will be needed. The CNC rails are to be reviewed and replaced and/or repaired. (We know there are at least two broken welds and the rails all need cleaning at minimum.) Operation should be smooth between all transitions. The electrical system will require new PLC, motor drives, motors and interconnecting cables at a minimum. This will eliminate the need to home the system when there is a power failure or if an outside force moves the manipulator. The control software needs to be replaced to operate with the updated drives and PLC system. New software should be able to operate on Windows 10, 64 bit operating system. The DDA source generator and tube need to be of the latest commercially available tehcnology. The water cooler for the DDA tube needs to be replaced. The high voltage cable needs to be replaced at a minimum. The DDA detector and software also needs to be updated to current imaging system and software that can operate on Windows 10. Detector should be larger than the current one allowing for more imaging space with a smaller pixel size than the current system. A new system can operate off of one computer and use LCD screens allowing for more space in the control room. As much flexibility to upgrade DDA head, computer system, and monitoring systems needs to be concerned and implemented with the upgrade. Capturing of images needs to be at a resolution equal or greater than our current DDA method. Captured images need to be able to be digitally store and print files. Storage space shall be at a minimum 2 TB with file sizes being under 0.5 GB with the ability to upgrade system without the contractor. </span>See attached Purchase Description for further details. (Note: CDRL forms referenced in the PD will be provided at the time of formal solicitation.)<br /><br />See attached Sources Sought Synopsis with Contractor Capability Survey and Draft Product Description for additional information.</h1>

<p>This announcement is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> a request for proposals. Contractors shall not submit proposals in response to this notice.</p>
<p>Proposed Solicitation Number: W91CRB-19-R-0066 (revised to <strong>W91CRB-20-R-0001</strong>)</p>
<p>Estimated Solicitation Issue Date: On or about <strong>15&nbsp;November 2019</strong> with all documents, attachments and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov. No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued. Respondents are responsible for obtaining the documentation from the stated website.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this requirement on a full and open basis using the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will provide MSVs as part of the overall SPS TEP system, which provides the Soldier with a lightweight, modular, scalable, mission specific protective equipment system to maximize protection and mobility; allowing field commanders and Soldiers to select the personal protective equipment tier best suited for the planned mission. The MSV component consists of a concealable vest, which includes a cummerbund with two soft armor panels (one front and one back) covered in a camouflage cloth with hook and loop. In addition, MSV includes two side plate pockets with two side soft armor panels, and a tactical outer carrier which includes side plate pocket carriers and shoulder straps. The soft armor panels can be augmented with hard armor protective inserts or can be inserted into the tactical outer carrier that also accommodates hard armor protective inserts. The MSV is the base component of the TEP and it can be configured to provide varying degrees of Soldier protection while reducing weight to the greatest extent possible. The MSV is the basis of the TEP system Tiers 1 through 4.</p>
<p>The scope of work for this requirement includes all procurement and production activities necessary to manufacture the carrier, soft armor ballistic package, and other materials that constitute the SPS TEP MSV. To meet this immediate requirement, the Government intends to award&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;five (5) firm fixed price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts via a competitive acquisition on a best value trade off basis. Subsequent to contract award, delivery orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity procedures described at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 16.505.<br /><br />Period of Performance: Five year ordering base followed by two, 2-year options (additional ordering periods)<br /><br />Contract Minimum includes the Pre-First Article Testing/Technical Data Package and First Article Testing items.<br /><br /><strong>Quantity (The following quantities are estimates): Base (Years 1-5)&nbsp;874,000 eaches, Option&nbsp;1 (Years 6-7)&nbsp;250,000 eaches, Option&nbsp;Year 2 (Years 8-9)&nbsp;250,000 eaches and, any spares and technology insertion (estimated quantities pending). <br /></strong><br />Draft copies of the&nbsp;Purchase Description and patterns for this requirement may be requested via the FBO website.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 0004 is to provide an update to the anticipated SIR release date for 692M15-19-R-00005, change the main POC/CO, provide additional instructions to access the electronic administrative records at the William J Hughes Technical Centerâ€™s Superfund Repository, and provide a DRAFT Statement of Work for review.

â€¢ The SIR is anticipated to be released in the 1st quarter of FY20.

â€¢ The FAA Technical Center maintains a data repository on-site at Building 305 for the entire Superfund Program, as required under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The repository consists of numerous regulatory documents from the inception of the Technical Centerâ€™s Superfund Program to date. In order to access the Superfund Repository on-site, vendors can call 609-485-5999 to coordinate access. Vendors are permitted to make photocopies of any public documents within the Repository; however, vendors are required to furnish their own photocopy/scanner equipment 

Beginning sometime around 2016, as the Superfund Program began phasing in elements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, but continue to remain in compliance with CERCLA requirements, certain documents began being furnished in electronic format only. Since all electronic documents are currently saved behind the FAAâ€™s firewall, direct access to these documents is not permitted. However, copies of relevant electronic version-only documents have been saved to CDs and will be furnished directly to interested parties. Interested parties should note that the documents provided on the aforementioned CDs are NOT the COMPLETE library of the documents within the repository. The CDs only contain documents that were furnished in electronic format-only post-2016. Interested parties are still encouraged to visit the on-site repository at Building 305 to view the documents that are only currently available in a hardbound format. Copies of hardbound documents are not being provided electronically on CDs.

â€¢ For vendors who have already visited the on-site Data Repository and do not wish to re-visit, please email the Contracting Officer, Lori McLaughlin, to coordinate obtaining the electronic information. 

The DRAFT SOW has been provided for informational purposes. The full solicitation will be released in the 1st quarter of FY20. 

â€¢ The Contracting Officer for this requirement has been changed to Lori McLaughlin, lori.mclaughlin@faa.gov.

<p>Project Magnitude: Japanese Equivalent of Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000;</p>
<p>Project Description: This project will construct, through renovation and new addition, an elementary school with functional areas containing neighborhood instructional spaces, special education spaces, staff collaboration spaces, commons area, multipurpose room, information center, physical education, art room, music room, administration suite, health suite, guidance counseling suite, special education suite, food service, janitorial workroom, maintenance support, school supply/storage area, technology service center, and other required areas for a fully functioning elementary school. Typical construction for new building addition is to consist of special deep foundation systems, reinforced concrete and structural steel framing and reinforced concrete bearing and shear walls. Interior construction will consist of reinforced concrete interior bearing and shear-walls, gypsum wallboard partitions, and operable / movable partition walls. The project is to renovate approximately 6550 square meters of the existing school facilities and construct a new addition of approximately 7525 square meters. The project will require demolition of approximately 4200 square meters of existing facilities.<br />Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) principles for high performance and sustainable building requirements will be included in the design and construction of the project in accordance with federal laws and Executive Orders. Low Impact Development will be included in the design and construction of this project as appropriate.</p>
<p>This project will provide Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) features, including design for progressive collapse and blast-rated windows and doors, and comply with AT/FP regulations, and physical security mitigation in accordance with DoD Minimum Anti-Terrorism Standards for Buildings.</p>
<p>Project includes the construction within the school building of Designated Seismic Systems (DSS). DSS are those systems identified in the plans and specifications that must remain operable following a design earthquake. DSS have special requirements for certification(s) of the installed equipment of the DSS as well as Special Inspection requirements during construction. Project also includes other construction that requires Special Inspection of structural, architectural, electrical, and fire protection systems. Special Inspections are in addition to the standard Quality Control inspections required by the contract.<br />Facilities will be designed to provide cyber security engineering and validation as specified in DoD Unified Facilities Criteria.</p>
<p>Special foundation features are required due to poor near-surface subgrade soils capacity.<br />The project includes related infrastructure such as water, sewer, electrical, telephone, local area network, community access television systems, and provisions for interior and campus wireless access. The project includes site improvements such as site preparation, signage, fencing, paving, sidewalks, landscaping, exterior lighting, retaining walls, pedestrian bridges, canopies, covered walkways, play lots, play areas, outdoor learning, storm water, low impact development, and external AT/FP. Reconfigured parking area to include: staff and visitor parking areas, parent drop off lane, emergency/service access lanes, and loading/delivery areas.</p>
<p>The project will require hazardous material mitigation for all buildings to be demolished or renovated. U.S. Federal and Japan Environmental Laws and Regulations shall be followed. Asbestos containing materials and lead based paint are present in the existing facilities. The site is a known radon risk. Radon mitigation will be required.</p>
<p>The government anticipates the Period of Performance will be 42 months.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) NCO1 Contracting Office
issued a sole source award to Air Planning LLC to provide Emergency Air Ambulance Services, including medical services and personnel for patients of the Togus (Augusta Maine) VA Medical Center.

The Government s intent was to form an agreement with an air transportation provider with the ability to leverage multiple air ambulance assets and offer medical response personnel under GSA contract. 

In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work was a logical follow-on to an original order placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures.
This purchase was made using FAR Part 8 Procedures and the posting procedures
required by FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)(i).

This notice is neither a request for quote nor a solicitation for offers. Please feel free to contact

JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.Â   Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)

 23 Christopher Way 
 Eatontown, NJ 07724 

Description of Action: The proposed action is for the issuance of a firm-fixed-price delivery order under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for brand name Medicor Imaging, a Division of LEAD Technologies, Inc., for maintenance and technical support of the Medicor Imaging Picture Archive Communication System (MiPACS) for the following VA Medical facilities:

Description of Supplies or Services: The proposed action is for the acquisition of MiPACS Dental Enterprise System annual maintenance and support for VA, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), for the MiPACS systems currently in use at VA medical facilities where dental procedures are performed.  VA requires brand name maintenance on the existing parts, labor, and equipment to support and maintain all software and related equipment for the MiPACS system.  Contractor shall provide annual maintenance for MiPACS software including access to new versions, updates and patches to MiPACS components that are released.  These maintenance services are necessary for VHA to provide operational and successful support of the MiPACS systems for the existing infrastructure to be able to operate successfully.  The period of performance is a 12-month base period with four12-month option periods.  The total estimated price is $300,000.00 inclusive of options.  

Statutory Authority: Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(a)(4), the following brand name requirement is being justified and approved as an exception to fair opportunity under the statutory authority of Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized .

Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited: Based on market research, as described in section 8 of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is available among resellers for the required maintenance and support.  The VISN 10 organization is based on MiPACS software and hardware that are essential to the interoperability of the systems.  VA requires the renewal of the maintenance packages for continued maintenance service to include parts, labor, equipment, technical support, and maintain all software and equipment for the MiPACS system. In addition, enhancements and feature requests developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  MiPACS software is a proprietary product; therefore, only MiPACS or a reseller can provide the necessary software updates, because of the proprietary source code required to develop and implement software updates. Medicor does not authorize third party vendors to work on their solution.  No other vendor has access to the proprietary source code to issue updates and releases to the existing software.  No other source is capable of providing the required maintenance that meets VA's functional requirements.  Failure to maintain the existing software and equipment will be detrimental to the operability of the existing infrastructure.  Without the support and maintenance, a risk to veterans may occur by delaying dental care if failure, bugs, or other issues occur with the MiPACS.  Brand name MiPACS maintenance is the only maintenance that meets the Government's requirements and Medicor does not allow other third-party vendors to maintain their solution.  

Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in section 8 of this justification.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  However, the undersigned VA technical representative determined that limited competition is available among authorized resellers for brand name MiPACS software maintenance and support.  In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A)(1), this justification will be provided with the solicitation to all appropriate NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.301, 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), and 16.505(a)(4)(iii), the award notice for this action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website and this justification will be made publicly available within 14 days of award as the total contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.
Market Research:  The Government's technical experts conducted market research during April 2019 and at present there is no other software maintenance available in the market place with the same functionality that can readily integrate with the existing infrastructure to replace the MiPACS software currently in use.  Although similar products such as PaxeraDental and INFINITT possess similar capabilities to provide the required software support maintenance, only Medicor has access to the proprietary source code, existing proprietary database structures, protocols, and software application programming interfaces specific to the software support maintenance for this particular software.  Without access to the proprietary source code, existing proprietary database structures, protocols, and software application programming interfaces, software support maintenance and any updates or upgrades cannot be installed, which could result in the MiPACS infrastructure functioning with an outdated and/or unsupportable software version. This would provide less functionality to the end users or system failure.  VA networking Subject Matter Experts regularly review industry trade publications and conduct internet research to ascertain if any other software maintenance and upgrades are available for the proprietary Medicor software and hardware.  Based on all of these market research efforts, the Government's technical experts have determined that only the aforementioned Medicor brand name maintenance and support can meet all of the Government's needs.
 
Based on the market research conducted by the Government's technical experts, it was determined that no other brand of maintenance and support can meet the Government's requirements due to the need to access the source code and other proprietary data of the MiPACS software to perform the maintenance support services.  Unauthorized software providers do not have access to the proprietary data of the software to be able to provide troubleshooting, upgrades and updates, point releases, service releases and security releases.  Only MiPACS or its resellers have access to the source code of the software to provide the necessary support. 

The Technology Acquisition Center conducted market research in August 2019 through the use of the Provider Lookup Tool on the NASA SEWP V GWAC web site and posted a Request for Information (RFI).  The research revealed that there are multiple resellers of brand name MiPACS maintenance and support including multiple verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) within Group B(2).  Additionally, NASA SEWP V has a dynamic catalog where line items can be added based on customer requests; therefore, as long as the required item or service is within scope of the NASA SEWP V contracts, items and services can be added to the catalog on a daily basis.  Therefore, based on the results of the market research, there is reasonable expectation that sufficient competition exists among SDVOSBs in Group B.

Other Facts: None 
Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:Â  I hereby determine that the anticipated price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based on anticipated competition and discounts among NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.  Additionally, NASA SEWP has determined that all catalog prices on its GWAC are fair and reasonable.  Additional price analysis may be performed in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b).
