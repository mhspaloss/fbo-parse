<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) / National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) /Division of Safety Research (DSR) in Morgantown, WV, intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Mechanical Simulation Corp of Ann Arbor, MI. The contractor will provide updates to the Quad DS simulation software used by NIOSH for research to support the development of science-based safety guidelines for commercial vehicle drivers (including police, ambulance drivers, and firefighters) when they approach intersections. NIOSH is seeking to add some module assets (e.g., different types of trees, building, and pedestrians) that are tightly integrated to QUAD DS and are synchronized with vehicle physics for TruckSIM. See attached Draft Statement of Work for more details.
<p>The proposed module assets are for the NIOSH Mechanical Simulation Quad DS 4-post driving simulator, which are available exclusively from Mechanical Simulation and use proprietary software to integrate the NIOSH 3D scenes and vehicles. No other sources sell the plug-in assets and have all of the 3D modeling knowledge, vehicle engineering and physics knowledge, and the specific proprietary knowledge of assets to properly and successfully integrate the assets into the existing NIOSH digital driving simulation scenarios.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the NIOSH DSR PTB simulator system and software is required to successfully integrate the needed plug-in assets with the simulator. The software is developed and maintained by Mechanical Simulation, and only their staff has the experience and training required to modify and fully integrate updates to the Quad DS 4-post driving simulator.</p>
<p>This Procurement is for Commercial Items as defined by FAR Parts 2 &amp; 12. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The NAICS code for this action is 511210 and the small business size standard is $38.5 M.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within 10 days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. Responses must include the DUNS of the company, and registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) will be required to be considered for award.<br />A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any quotation/response must be emailed to Florence Black at fpblack@cdc.gov by 9:00 AM Eastern Time on June 5, 2018.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
