Responses to this request will be considered for the purpose of determining how the requirements will be stated and how the procurement will be conducted. The work to be performed is described below.
<p><br />This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. A solicitation is not currently available. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.</p>
<p><br />The Bureau of Reclamation Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program (LCR MSCP) was created to balance the use of the Colorado River water resources with the conservation of native species and their habitats. The program works toward the recovery of species currently listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  It also reduces the likelihood of additional species listings.  Implemented over a 50-year period, the program accommodates current water diversions and power production and will optimize opportunities for future water and power development by providing ESA compliance through the implementation of a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP).</p>

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.<BR><BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—

      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and

      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>(vi) The National Institute of Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) requires Neurofilament light (NfL) assays for use in it's Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) research study. Neurofilament light (NfL) protein is expressed in brain neurons. NfL protein is released in significant quantity following axonal damage or neuronal degeneration. NfL is associated with traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. There are disparities in the rates of brain dysfunction by race and poverty status. It is possible that NfL is one factor underlying disparities in the ways in which brain dysfunction manifests in different races and in adults with different socioeconomic statuses. NIH HANDLS researchers have examined various sources for disparities in cognitive decline including nutritional factors, genotypes, psychosocial stress, and neighborhood environments. Carrying these investigations further requires data on likely biomarkers of cognitive decline, of which NfL is a leading candidate. Little is known about the distribution of this marker in minority or socioeconomically diverse groups. It is possible that NfL may be an early marker of cognitive decline leading to dementia.</p>

<p>(vi) The National Institute of Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) requires state-of-art Simoa 96-well plate assay kits for quantification of serum/plasma of AB40, AB42, Total Tau, IL-6 and NF-Light. These biomarkers will be assayed using baseline biospecimens from women followed for many years through the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) is an ancillary study to WHI randomized clinical trial of the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on health outcomes. The current project will investigate the biology of cognitive resilience in women who carry the Apolipoprotein E e4 risk allele for Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as risk factors for cognitive impairment in women who have developed cognitive impairment. The current project makes use of stored biospecimens from WHI baseline assessment to investigate potential biomarkers of cognitive resilience as well as development of probable dementia. This project requires the use of high throughput equipment and sensitive assays for the identification biomarkers in serum/plasma of AB40, AB42, Total Tau, IL-6 and NF-Light. These biomarkers will provide important insights into the biological underpinnings of cognitive resilience and cognitive impairment years before any symptoms would be apparent.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p><br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.217-5 -- Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)</p>
<p>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(17) Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Transatlantic Middle East District (TAM) Awarded the Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B) construction project for the Large Aircraft Maintenance Hangar (LAMH). This project will be constructed within the Al Dhafra Base in UAE. A single firm fixed price contract is awarded to Amana Contracting &amp; Steel Building Co. WLL.</p>
<p>This project scope is for a large hangar, access apron pavement, utilities and other infrastructure that are required for a complete and usable LAMH. The structure(s) will serve as hangar space for one or more aircraft and each may contain organizational, maintenance, and administration spaces. The facilities must include a 6,000 SM single bay, large aircraft maintenance hangar, with fuel cell maintenance capabilities, and exterior lighting. Supply space must be provided within one of the structures. Hangar access and parking aprons of approximately 8,900 SM will also be constructed. The facilities will include the construction of water storage tanks for fire protection and domestic water supply, and a domestic sewage holding tank with the ability to convert to a small lift station to integrate with the full build-out of the sanitary sewer collection system for the U.S. Development Area. Included in the layout will need to be an electrical yard to house multiple permanent compact substations and temporary generators until commercial power can be provided, and a mechanical yard to house the chiller and other mechanical equipment. The facility layout must have roadway pavement and vehicular parking. Roadway includes a looped road on backside of hangar to provide fire apparatus the ability to turn around. Finally, there will need to be a communications distribution system that includes a fiber optic Outside Plant (OSP) distribution system, NIPRNet and SIPRNet, and Electronic Security Systems (ESS) which provide Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) capabilities.</p>
