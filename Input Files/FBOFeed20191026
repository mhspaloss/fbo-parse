Failure to comply with instructions, or provide complete information may affect the firm's evaluation or disqualify the firm from further consideration. Criteria 1 and 2 are most important and equally weighted. Criteria 3 through Criteria 7 are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Specialized Experience <br />2. Professional Qualifications<br />3. Past Performance <br />4. Quality Control <br />5. Program Management, Capacity, and Location <br />6. Volume of Work</p>

<p>Criterion 1-Specialized Experience (SF330, Part I, Section F): <br />Firms will be evaluated on specialized experience in performance of services similar to those anticipated under this contract through evaluation of experience in each of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Code or life safety investigation study<br />2. Preliminary planning study that includes preparing materials used to create a DD1391 Military Construction Project Data form for a proposed project.</p>
<p>3. Design-bid-build construction package (including cost estimating) for new construction or substantial renovation of an occupied facility (not an interior remodel or tenant improvement).</p>
<p>4. Design-bid Request for Proposal package (including cost estimating) for new construction or substantial renovation of an occupied facility (not an interior remodel or tenant improvement).</p>
<p>Firms may be considered more favorably by demonstrating designer of record experience in the following:</p>
<p>1. Preliminary planning study in accordance with NAVFAC ECB 2016-01 Preliminary Design Deliverables for Department of Navy Military Construction Projects.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrating a diversity of architectural experience with respect to the list of typical projects above.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrating experience providing specialty design consultation experience such as acoustical analysis and testing or completion of a Best Value Determination and Comprehensive Interior Design package for Department of Navy Military Construction Projects.</p>
<p>Criteria Submission requirements: <br />Provide a maximum of ten projects completed (design [for items #1 and 2 above] and construction [for item #3]) within the past seven years (as of the due date of the SF 330) that best demonstrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above. Sufficient information to determine the date of completion of the project must be included in the project description or the project will not be considered. If more than the maximum number of projects are submitted, the Government will only evaluate projects up to the maximum number authorized in the order submitted.</p>
<p>All projects provided in the SF330 must be completed by the actual office/branch/regional office/individual team member proposed to manage and perform work under this contract. Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF330 Part 1, Section F, block 25, "Firm Name" Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c). In block 24, include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above. For projects performed as a subcontractor or a joint venture involving different partners, specifically identify the specific roles and responsibilities performed as a subcontractor or by those firms on the project rather than the work performed on the project as a whole and list the prime contractor. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities participating on this contract, the project shall be eliminated from consideration.</p>
<p>NOTE: If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, projects shall be submitted for each joint venture partner. Firms failing to provide projects from all joint venture partners will be considered to have not met the requirements of the criterion. The project limit for joint ventures remains at ten.</p>
<p>Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330 at Part I, Section F and shall be completed projects. Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration. For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award. Do not submit an IDIQ contract as an example project. Instead, submit relevant task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above as individual projects. The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in the SF330, Part I, Section F. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluation of Criterion 1. Section F is limited to 2 pages per project.</p>
