<p>(v) Assay Development Karyotyping Services</p>
<p>(vi) The National Institute on Aging (NIA) require assay development karyotyping services to provide genetically engineered iPSCs for the purpose of creating a national cell repository as an open resource for the scientific community and as a tool to characterize how mutations change fundamental biological properties of disease-relevant cell types. Neurodegenerative diseases are common, debilitating, and often untreatable. It is known that mutations in ~50 genes cause the majority of inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). In addition, some ADRD genes function together to regulate key cellular processes, strongly suggesting the presence of converging disease mechanisms in ADRD. Genetically-defined patient cohorts now exist and are growing, setting the stage for future precision medicine trials. However, in order to develop effective targeted therapies for these defined cohorts, we need a deeper mechanistic understanding of how individual gene mutations cause disease. In addition, we need to systematically identify and characterize converging ADRD disease pathways, which may be ideal drug targets because single drugs could be effective in patients with mutations in different, but functionally related, genes. To aid in this effort, we require the creation of isogneic panels of genome-engineered human iPSC lines harboring mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-OA-19-010785-CSS and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items. This acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

<p>(v) DNA and RNA Sequencing of parental iPSC cell lines</p>
<p>(vi) The National Institute on Aging (NIA) require DNA and RNA sequencing services for the purpose of creating a national cell repository as an open resource for the scientific community and as a tool to characterize how mutations change fundamental biological properties of disease-relevant cell types. Neurodegenerative diseases are common, debilitating, and often untreatable. It is known that mutations in ~50 genes cause the majority of inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). In addition, some ADRD genes function together to regulate key cellular processes, strongly suggesting the presence of converging disease mechanisms in ADRD. Genetically-defined patient cohorts now exist and are growing, setting the stage for future precision medicine trials. However, in order to develop effective targeted therapies for these defined cohorts, a deeper mechanistic understanding is needed of how individual gene mutations cause disease. In addition, NIA need to systematically identify and characterize converging ADRD disease pathways, which may be ideal drug targets because single drugs could be effective in patients with mutations in different, but functionally related, genes. To aid in this effort, the creation of isogneic panels of genome-engineered human iPSC lines harboring mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases is needed. It is anticipated that this resource will substantially accelerate the pace of mechanistic discovery regarding how ADRD mutations cause disease.</p>

<p>(v) Combined Sputter/Carbon Coater Instrument</p>
<p>(vi) The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisition on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order for a Combined Sputter/Carbon Coater Instrument on a brand-name or equal basis.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program, requires a combined sputter/carbon coater for use in its research of electron microscopy analysis workflow. The combined sputter/carbon coater will sputter conductive metals onto samples for standard Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging, as well as evaporate finely grained carbon for research-grade thin film support surfaces for imaging samples by Transmission Electron Microscopy. It is critical when performing electron microscopy analysis to provide a grounded sample and placing a fine layer of metal or carbon on the sample is the primary method to prevent build-up of a negative charge. This charge degrades image quality. In addition, this system may also be used to render support films hydrophilic and this allows for even distribution of sample and reagent on support films. The essential characteristics of the combined sputter/carbon coater: (1) versatile coating system which takes the place of three separate instruments, yet still delivers research quality results on each application; (2) optimized for high-vacuum applications, with an ultimate vacuum of 1 x 10-6 mbar; (3) use of a wide-range Penning/Pirani gauge enables the sputtering of oxidizing metals with ultra-fine grain sizes, which are required for high resolution imaging with our SEM; (4) unique lower background pressure which removes oxygen, nitrogen, and water vapor from the chamber, avoiding chemical reactions during the sputter process, which could otherwise lead to impurities or defects in the coatings; and (5) lower scattering allows for high purity, amorphous carbon films of high density. Combined Sputter/Carbon Coater Instrument may be brand-name or equal to the instrument manufactured by Electron Microscopy Sciences, A Division of EMS Acquisition Corporation, 1560 Industry Road, P.O. Box 550, Hatfield, PA 19440: (1) Item number: 27621. Item Description: EMS/Ql50V ES COMBINED SPUTTERING/CARBON COATER. Optimized for high-vacuum applications. The deposition heads can be swapped in seconds and the intelligent system logic automatically recognizes which bead is in place and displays the appropriate operating settings. Consists of high resolution turbomolecular pumped capacitative touch screen-controlled sputter coater with status LED indicator, including quick release sputter insert and one TK8845 57mm diameter x 0.3mm Chromium target, and high vacuum carbon rod evaporation coater, including quick-release carbo n rod insert for 3.05mm diameter carbon rods. Coating inserts are interchangeable. I 0067 rotating specimen stage, 50mm diameter, supplied as standard. Quantity: 1-Each; (2) Item number: 91003. Item Description: VACUUM PUMP DUO 6 (PFEIFFER).

EVALUATION PROCESS: 
The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation that provides the best benefit to the Government, price and other factors considered. Proposals will be evaluated by performing a comparative evaluation in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3) to determine which response represents the best as a whole. 
Proposals will be evaluated by performing a direct comparison of one offer with another in a uniform manner to determine which proposal provides the government with its needs, as identified in the RFQ. The government reserves the right to consider a response that offers more than the minimum and select that response if it provides a benefit to the government. The government has the discretion to accept other than the lowest priced offeror that provides additional benefits. The government also has the has the discretion to make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best benefit to the government.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  
Technical Acceptability.  Each offeror s technical quotations will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides acceptable delivery time, product, safety plan, safety record and added value if required. 
Buy American Act compliance
Pricing: The sum of all the CLINs will represent the total evaluated price. Proposed price must be determined to be fair and reasonable to be eligible for award in terms of reasonableness and realism.

Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. 


Comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for like items. 

Use of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry. 

Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements. 

Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. 

Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items. 

Analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. 

Because below-cost prices are not inherently improper, when vendors are competing for award of a fixed-price contract, vendors are given notice that a business decision to submit a low-priced quotation may be considered as reflecting on their understanding of the contract requirements or the risk associated with their approach.

Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing exits when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items for the base and or option years is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

<DESC><br />(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-OA-19-010498-CSS and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items. This acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>THIS IS A NON-COMPETITIVE COMBINED SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted as non-competitive for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source. (1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisition on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition (Including brand-name) for Assay Development Karyotyping Services with KromaTiD, Inc., 1880 Industrial Circle, Suite A, Longmont, CO, 80501-6548. The rationale for the sole-single source justification is that KaryoTid is the only source available that and assure the continuity of our on- going research experiments.</p>
<p>(iii) This solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2019-05, effective August 13, 2019.</p>
<p>(iv) The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code: 541714 Research and Development in Biotechnology (except Nanobiotechnology), Size Standard: 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(v) Assay Development Karyotyping Services</p>
<p>(vi) The National Institute on Aging (NIA) require assay development karyotyping services to provide genetically engineered iPSCs for the purpose of creating a national cell repository as an open resource for the scientific community and as a tool to characterize how mutations change fundamental biological properties of disease- relevant cell types. Neurodegenerative diseases are common, debilitating, and often untreatable. It is known that mutations in ~50 genes cause the majority of inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). In addition, some ADRD genes function together to regulate key cellular processes, strongly suggesting the presence of converging disease mechanisms in ADRD. Genetically-defined patient cohorts now exist and are growing, setting the stage for future precision medicine trials. However, in order to develop effective targeted therapies for these defined cohorts, we need a deeper mechanistic understanding of how individual gene mutations cause disease. In addition, we need to systematically identify and characterize converging ADRD disease pathways, which may be ideal drug targets because single drugs could be effective in patients with mutations in different, but functionally related, genes. To aid in this effort, we require the creation of isogneic panels of genome-engineered human iPSC lines harboring mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the specific requirements below.<br />Specific Requirements: (1) Cell culture and prep for dGH assay for 16 cell lines; (2) Assay, imaging, and scoring for human dosimetry for 16 samples, with 3 processed images per sample; and (3) transfer of original image files.</p>
