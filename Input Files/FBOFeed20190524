<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 855-3556. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.</p>
<p>20. Buyer name, phone#, and email address Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer William Crowder, 405-855-3060, william.crowder.3@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) accomplishes its mission for natural resource conservation and outdoor recreation in communities across America through the Conservation and Outdoor Recreation Division (COR).  COR embraces the principles of civic engagement, collaboration, and cooperative conservation.  Partnerships form the foundation upon which the COR Division acts to connect the American public to their natural, cultural, and recreational heritage. COR programs extend and expand the contributions of the National Park Service in Parks and throughout the nation. Through close and ongoing partnerships with sister federal and state agencies, regional and local offices, agencies, organizations, and individuals, we develop and protect an enhanced network of parks, trails, rivers, and other special places across the country for the enjoyment of all Americans. COR programs include: Hydropower Recreation Assistance which provides technical assistance on recreation access and facilities, instream flows for recreation, and riparian corridor protection to all participants in licensing proceedings of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); Wild and Scenic Rivers which supports the 64 rivers in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System for which NPS has responsibilities to protect free-flowing condition and outstanding natural, cultural, and recreation values for the enjoyment of present and future generations; and Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance (RTCA) which assists community-led natural resource conservation and outdoor recreation initiatives by providing guidance to conserve waterways, preserve open space, and develop trails, parks greenways, and to improve waterway access. The COR Division also manages a newly formed Office of Outdoor Recreation to serve as the gateway for stakeholders and interests to engage with the NPS on recreation, tourism and visitor service-related topics and issues, as well as providing technical support and expertise to staff and others on outdoor recreation topics and efforts to enhance public access and improve the visitor experience.

Additional specialized expertise is urgently required to enable NPS to remain effectively engaged in these program areas, specifically, Hydropower Assistance, Wild and Scenic River issues, rivers, trails, and conservation assistance projects, and outdoor recreation.

Dredging of maintenance and unclassified material between Stations 0+000 to 70+000, debris removal, diving, and bird abatement shall be included in the contract. All dredged material will be disposed of in existing confined upland disposal areas. Hopper dredging is not allowed for this work. Work will not be allowed above Station 63+360 in the harbor from approximately April 1 to May 15 to avoid impacts to striped bass fishery resources. Dredging of stations 55+000 to 70+000, excluding maintenance material from 57+000 to 60+000, will not begin before 1 December 2020.</p>
<p>The material to be removed includes new work materials and overlying maintenance materials. O&amp;M quantities are subject to change with O&amp;M cycles, but approximately 9,919,000 cubic yards of maintenance material will be removed along with new work material. Materials may vary substantially both vertically and horizontally. Two feet of paid overdepth will be allowed, however the contractor shall not exceed -3.0 feet beyond the maximum pay depth.</p>
<p>Disposal of all materials from the inner harbor will be in the existing confined upland Dredge Material Containment Areas (DMCA) designated as 13A, 13B, 14A, 14B, and Jones/Oysterbed Island. The contractor will be responsible for proper operation and maintenance of the disposal areas during dredging operations. Material between Stations 24+000 and 55+000 contains material with elevated levels of naturally occurring cadmium that will be dredged as part of this project. All cadmium materials will be placed within disposal area 14A, and DMCA 14B will serve as a backup. Dredging of the cadmium materials will be required prior to placement of a 3 +/- 1ft foot cap of non-cadmium material over the entire site. To facilitate placement of the cap, the cadmium material will be distributed evenly over the entire disposal area(s). The material designated for the cap is of relatively coarse grained material from between Stations 0+000 and 24+000. Prior to placement of the cap, the cadmium will be kept in a moist state.</p>
<p>Wildlife/Bird abatement will be performed in the disposal areas that are receiving the cadmium materials to reduce the wildlife use of those areas both during the construction period and before capping. This will minimize their risk of potential exposure to cadmium. Acceptable methods for wildlife/bird abatement are described within the specifications.</p>
<p>During previous dredging operations in this area, unexploded ordinance (UXO) has been encountered. In the event that UXO are encountered, follow the procedure as outlined within the specifications. A mechanical dredge shall be required to dredge the maintenance material between the reach of the channel between approximate stations 57+000 and 60+000. The contractor shall screen the material for UXO prior to placement of the material in the confined upland disposal areas.</p>
<p>The contractor will not be entitled to equitable adjustment or reimbursement for work stoppage of 24 hours or less from the time the Contracting Officer directs the contractor to stop for the reasons listed within the plans and specifications.</p>
<p>The estimated construction duration for inner harbor dredging Reaches C, D, &amp; E is 810 days.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria: The contract will be solicited and procured using FAR 14 Sealed Bidding Procedures.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Medical Materiel Development Activity's (USAMMDA's) mission is to develop and deliver quality medical capabilities to protect, treat, and sustain the health of our Service Members. The Joint Program Committee - 6's (JPC-6's) mission seeks to drive medical innovation through the development of knowledge and materiel solutions for the acute and early management of combat-related trauma.
<p>ECLS is administered to critically ill patients suffering from life-threatening renal injuries. Although this is a life-saving intervention, current technology is limited by the immense logistical footprint required to support these devices. Current standard of care ECLS devices that provide support to the kidneys require ~70L of replacement fluid per patient per day. This is an immense logistical burden in the far forward environment where supply lines are limited or non-existent making the support of these devices infeasible. Therefore, the aim of this effort is to reduce the amount of replacement fluid required to support these patients in a logistically constrained environment.</p>
<p>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), in support of the USAMMDA Combat Trauma and Acute Rehabilitation (CTAR) Project Management Office (PMO) and JPC-6, intends to solicit for research and development (R&amp;D) services to: (1) develop a small, lightweight, rugged ECLS device that provides continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to critically injured patients using less than or equal to 0.5 Liters (L) of replacement fluid per patient per day; (2) conduct necessary clinical trials to support U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submission; and (3) obtain FDA clearance for the device.</p>
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation has been scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) on or about 17 April 2019. Specifications of the requirement will be provided in solicitation W81XWH-19-R-0036.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that the solicitation will result in the award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee R&amp;D contract, with up to thirty-six (36) months of performance. The Government's objectives will be outlined in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code selected for this acquisition is 541715-Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology); and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside. Award shall be made on a competitive basis, using the best value tradeoff process among cost/price and non-cost/-price factors described at FAR 15.101-1. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>Those interested in obtaining the solicitation (once posted) can access it at the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov and search for solicitation W81XWH-19-R-0036. Vendors wishing to submit an offer are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP and for frequently monitoring the site for any amendments. Requests made by phone will not be accepted. No solicitations will be provided by hard copy, fax, or e-mail. Failure to respond to the electronically posted RFP and associated amendments prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals specified on the solicitation may render vendor offer non-responsive and result in rejection of the same. The Government is not responsible for any loss of internet connectivity or for an Offeror's inability to access the documents posted at the referenced website.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award or payment from any Department of Defense activity, Offerors must provide registration information to the System for Award Management (SAM)*. All Offerors must be registered in SAM for "All Awards" prior to receiving an award. The Offeror's SAM record must be active and should include the NAICS that has been selected for this procurement. An entity can be registered in SAM under multiple NAICS if they are applicable to the entity's business. EARLY REGISTRATION IS ADVISED. Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished, at www.sam.gov. This includes the online representations and certifications located within SAM.</p>
<p>*Entities registering in SAM must submit a notarized letter appointing their authorized Entity Administrator. Please note that the instructions for domestic and international entities differ.

<DESC><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Test Center (AFTC),46th Test Squadron (46 TS), Specialized Contracting Branch (PZIE) at Eglin AFB is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statements from potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), and Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small businesses that are capable of the requirement listed below.
<p>The 46th Test Squadron (46 TS) Datalinks Test Flight (TGBC) located at Eglin AFB FL has determined that a need exists to upgrade their F-15C Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP) and F-15E Operational Facilities (OPFAC) to the Suite 9 Multifunctional Information Distribution System - Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS) configuration. In addition to the Suite 9 upgrade, the OPFACs will require modernization upgrades to replace the multifunctional displays that have reached the end of their operational life with replacement flat panel displays. As part of the Suite 9 upgrade, the 46 TS is requesting the Contractor include additional upgrades and features to the OPFACs for U.S. Government's consideration that will further enhance our test capabilities in the Link 16 environment.</p>
<p>The 46 TS also has a need for a Test Device to serve as a replacement for the current F-15E OPFAC which will be relocated to another building after the Suite 9 upgrade to support other test requirements. The device will simulate an F-15E aircraft operating in Link 16 operational, tactical, and training events, where a fully functional F-15E cockpit is required in the event. The simulator must communicate as an actual F-15E in test scenarios created to emulate realistic combat situations. The Test Device shall support Windows 10 Operating System and be delivered with the current fielded Suite 8 OFP with the capability of upgrading to Suite 9 at a later date. It is requested that the device be developed to host both the Fighter Data Link (FDL) and MIDS-JTRS.</p>
<p>The following requirements must be met or exceeded:<br />&bull; Facilities Clearance and personnel with the appropriate Secret security clearance</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to complete installation and integration of Suite 9 system no later than CY 2020</p>
<p>&bull; Sustainment capabilities of the OPFAC and Test Device for a period of five (5) years from the date of completion of the installation and integration of the first phase.</p>
<p>&bull; Expertise in validation and acceptance test criteria as well as the Suite 9 accreditation requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Firm connections and understanding of the commercial specialized electronics market including commercial research and development laboratories.</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge of Operational Flight Program on F-15.</p>
<p>&bull; Experience with process oriented integration of specialized electronics into military and other Government agency applications.</p>
<p>&bull; Broad knowledge base of relevant US Government technology that is fielded or in development, and intimate knowledge of the process in which our acquisition strategy works.</p>
<p>All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to meet the requirements above and the attached questionnaire to the POC listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 541330, Engineering Services, with a size standard exception of $38.5M for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>A comprehensive draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is available only to U.S. contractors and will exclusively be available to DoD contractors certified under the Defense Logistic Agencies (DLA)'s Joint Certification Program (JCP). Certification under the JCP establishes the eligibility of a U.S. contractor to technical data governed, in the U.S., by DoD Directive 5230.25. A certification is required by U.S. contractors that wish to obtain access to unclassified technical data disclosing militarily critical technology with military or space application that is under the control of, or in the possession of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Contractors must submit a DD Form 2345 to the U.S. Joint Certification Office, along with a copy of the company's State/Provincial License, Incorporation Certificate, Sales Tax Identification Form or other documentation which verifies the legitimacy of the company. Comments on the draft SOO are being sought from interested qualified vendors for the purposes of clarification of the government's requirements. For copies of the SOO, please submit your company CAGE code to establish your eligibility via email to the Contract Specialist identified below.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.

Responses should include the company name, CAGE code, point of contact, address, and phone number. Small businesses with only partial capabilities of this requirement are encouraged to submit their response demonstrating the portion of the requirement they are capable of providing/performing. This information will allow the Government to identify areas of possible breakout or possible subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: allison.mccowan@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "F-15 Suite 9 Upgrade." If this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through e-mail filters at Eglin AFB.

<p>All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency. If late information is received, it may be considered, depending on agency time constraints. All routine communications regarding the announcement should be directed to the contractual point of contact listed in this posting. The Government may or may not use any responses to this sources sought as a basis for a subsequent project/requirement. Any project/requirement developed from the sources sought responses may be the subject of a subsequent acquisition; any such subsequent acquisition will be posted in FedBizOpps.gov separately. Responses to this sources sought will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to the respondents with respect to any of the information submitted under this sources sought. No requests for a bid package or solicitation will be accepted; a bid package or solicitation does not exist at this time. In order to protect the integrity of any possible future acquisition, no additional information will be provided and no appointments for presentations will be made in reference to this sources sought.</p>
<p>It is possible that in addition to government employees, Contractor subject matter experts may review submitted responses to this sources sought. Respondents are advised that employees of commercial firms under contract with the Government may be used to administratively process submissions and perform other administrative duties requiring access to other contractor's proprietary information. These administrative support contractors include nondisclosure agreements prohibiting their contractor employees from disclosing any information submitted by other contractors or using such information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the Thermal Protection System (TPS) Production for Mars Sample Return (MSR). This potential procurement is to pursue highly reliable sample return missions that require an Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV) that will use robotic systems and a Mars ascent rocket to collect and send samples of martian rocks, soils, and atmosphere to Earth for detailed chemical and physical analysis. The EEV will use robust thermal protection system materials with substantial ground and flight test heritage in order to preserve the integrity of the returned samples.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Please note that to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel must be expended for employees of the small business awardee (see FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting).<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremendously productive pipeline and is innovative in several ways. NCATS brings together a diverse range of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, and engineers, in to ultimately translate basic science into real products and services that help improve people's lives.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements</strong><br /><br />The Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (STCL) in the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires analysis of the genomic methylation status of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) and their differentiated progeny - trophectodermal cells, and time course analysis of the genomic methylation status and open chromatin regions during induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation to astrocytes.<br /><br />The required services include:<br /><br />&bull; Methylation analysis methods: MeDIP Sequencing - using next-generation sequencing to determine the methylation status of selected genomic loci or genome-wide. Methylation is a prominent mechanism of silencing genes and creating a tissue-specific pattern of gene activity.<br />&bull; ATAC seq: This assay provides genome-wide profiles of open and accessible regions of chromatin that are indicative of active regulatory regions.

<DESC>NIMH and the trans-NIH Advanced Imaging and Microscopy (AIM) Resource are working together to build a dualview selective plane illumination microscope dedicated to rapidly imaging large samples of chemically cleared brain tissue (CT-DISPIM). This microscope is a modified clone of an existing system at AIM and requires an illumination source - a set of 4 lasers with different wavelengths, each with &gt;100mW power, that can be individually triggered and modulated by our existing control systems. The existing microscope uses a Coherent OBIS Laser Box as its illumination source, therefore a Coherent OBIS Laser Box or "equal" laser box is required to clone the microscope. Any laser box or lasers that are not compatible with the modified dualview selective plane illumination microscope will not be considered. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the purchase description.

Background
This is an equipment purchase related to Dr. Sarah Forster s Career Development Award.

Purpose
The requested equipment amplifies, digitizes, and records electrical signals related to neural processes and eye movements/blinks that can be detected at the surface of the scalp and face.  We will utilize these data for two primary purposes: (1) electrical signals related to specific brain processes will be examined as predictors of treatment response in a sample of Veterans with cocaine use disorder receiving two versions of an evidence-based intervention for cocaine users (Contingency Management) or standard outpatient care and (2) change in electrical signals related to specific brain processes from pre- to post-treatment will be examined to elucidate neuroadaptive mechanisms underlying treatment response.  In order to target specific brain processes of interest in the current study, we will need to record EEG during participant engagement with cognitive-behavioral tasks developed within our lab using VA-approved paradigm design software (E-Prime).  In addition, direct communication between E-Prime and the EEG system will be necessary to log task events in the EEG dataset in order to complete proposed analyses.

Requirements
The system should provide the following:
Active Electrodes (amplification of electrical signals at electrode sites)
Robust, Water-Tight Construction (active electrodes can withstand required sterilization procedures)
Ability to Replace Individual Electrodes 
Direct Communication with E-Prime (Accurate Event Timing Information is Transmitted to EEG system) 
Accurately and Reliably Logs Response Time Events 
Includes at Least 32 EEG Channels + Bipolar Channels for EOG
Includes EEG Caps of Different Sizes
Quick and Efficient Pre-Acquisition Set-Up
Achieves Excellent Signal Quality Without Requiring Scalp Abrasion

Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

The Vendor will be evaluated in accordance with the QASP.

The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate performance for the stated CONTRACT.  

This QASP explains the following:

What will be monitored?
How monitoring will take place.
Who will conduct the monitoring?
How monitoring efforts and results will be documented.

This QASP does not detail how the vendor accomplishes the work.  Rather, the QASP is created with the premise that the vendor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  It is the Government s responsibility to be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating performance.

This QASP is a  living document  and the Government may review and revise it on a regular basis.  However, the Government shall coordinate changes with the vendor through contract modification.  Copies of the original QASP and revisions shall be provided to the vendor and Government officials implementing surveillance activities.

Government Roles and Responsibilities:

The following personnel shall oversee and coordinate surveillance activities.

Contracting Officer (CO)   The CO shall ensure performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensure compliance with the contract terms, and shall safeguard the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship.  The CO shall also assure that the Vendor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under this contract. The CO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Vendor s performance.
Contracting Officer s Representative (COR)   The COR is responsible for technical administration of the contract and shall assure proper Government surveillance of the Vendor s performance. The COR shall keep a quality assurance file.  The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government s behalf.

Performance Standards:

The Vendor is responsible for performance of ALL terms and conditions of the contract. CORs will provide contract progress reports quarterly to the CO reflecting performance on this plan and all other aspects of the resultant contract. The performance standards outlined in this QASP shall be used to determine the level of vendor performance in the elements defined. Performance standards define desired services.  The Government performs surveillance to determine the level of vendor performance to these standards.

Methods of QA Surveillance:

Various methods exist to monitor performance.  The COR shall use the surveillance methods listed below in the administration of this QASP.

Direct observation:  100% surveillance
Periodic inspections: inspections scheduled and reported quarterly per COR delegation or as needed. 
Validated user/customer complaints: data will be collected from actual patient complaints. Complaints will be investigated and verified.
Random sampling: vendor log books will be reviewed by COR for compliance
Verification and/or documentation provided by vendor: vendor provided information on services provided to COR.

Performance Requirements:

The Performance Requirements are listed below.  The Government shall use these standards to determine vendor performance and shall compare vendor performance to the standard and assign a rating. At the end of the performance period, these ratings will be used, in part, to establish the past performance of the vendor on the contract and for purposes of providing the CO with information for inclusion on CPARS:


Measures
Performance
Requirement
Acceptable Quality Level
Surveillance
Method
Vendor shall submit accurate invoices
Vendor to submit accurate invoices (contract and task order under VAAR Clause 852.232-72)

Direct observation (review of invoices)
Regular deliveries: Austin OPC pick up no earlier than 11:45 am and no later than 12: noon (clinic closes at noon sharp, courier must arrive before then).

User/Customer Complaints
Vendor has a plan in place for handling complaints and all complaint responses are submitted to the COR or CO within two (2) business days of complaint
100%
Verification provided by vendor/Validated user and customer complaints (response and documentation from vendor)


If vendor performance does not meet the Acceptable Quality level, the CO shall inform the Vendor.  This will normally be in writing unless circumstances necessitate verbal communication.  In any case the CO shall document the discussion and place it in the contract file.  When the COR and the CO determines formal written communication is required, the COR shall prepare a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR), and present it to CO. The CO will in turn review and will present to the vendor's program manager for corrective action.

The Vendor shall acknowledge receipt of the CDR in writing.  The CDR will specify if the Vendor is required to prepare a corrective action plan to document how the Vendor shall correct the unacceptable performance and avoid a recurrence.  

The CDR will also state how long after receipt the Vendor has to present this corrective action plan to the CO.  The Government shall review the Vendor's corrective action plan to determine acceptability. The CO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the vendor s performance and the acceptability of the vendor s corrective action plan. Any CDRs may become a part of the supporting documentation for any contractual action deemed necessary by the CO or for purposes of reporting vendor past performance on CPARS.

BigFix Subscription and Support  
Request for Information (RFI)

Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified vendors, who are able to meet Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements for Financial Management Support Services.  Any contract/order that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of the competitive process.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry best practices, and input specific to the information provided.  The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Quote (RFQ), if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions will become Government property and will not be returned.  Interested vendors are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.

RFI Response Instructions

NOTE: The capability package must be clear, concise, and complete.  VA is under no obligation to provide feedback to the company, or to contact the company for clarification of any information submitted in response to this RFI.

Provide the following information: 

Provide Company Information:
Company Name
CAGE/DUNS Number under which the company is registered in SAM/VetBiz.gov
Company Address
Point of contact name
Telephone number
Email address
For small business concerns, indicate whether at least 50 percent of the total amount paid by the Government will be paid to firms that are similarly situated.
List any existing contracting vehicles you have with the VA that you would recommend for this requirement.

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) depends upon the unique capabilities of BigFix highly integrated with multiple platforms for enterprise (including Internet device) visibility, vulnerability management, threat detection, incident response, internal/external security compliance reporting and general endpoint management. In order to maintain and operate this critical platform the VA requires renewal and consolidation of software subscription, two (2) on-site  premium  support service personnel that have direct ties to BigFix Product Development, the ability to optionally purchase additional licenses at any time during the life of the contract at top-level, high-volume discounted pricing and flexibility in all licensing to allow for the shift of endpoint types over time (e.g. servers to workstation licenses, workstations to mobile devices (if the need arises)) in order to reflect the inevitable changes in enterprise make-up without forcing certain licenses to go unused and additional licenses to be acquired unnecessarily.   
VA requires a Five (5) Year Enterprise Support Agreement (ESA) that acknowledges and addresses the fact that VA:  
Requires the renewal of subscription and support services (S&S) on existing perpetual licenses owned by VA
Requires licensing to become flexible so that it supports the changing endpoint composition across all BigFix products currently owned; Allow for the optional addition of BigFix platform add-on features (currently available and being developed) during the life of the EA at a pre-set cost at the time of renewal or during any contract year (base or options).  RVUs should go away and be permanently converted to  endpoint licenses  based on the current inventory of roughly 32,000 servers, leaving just north of 564,000 clients ((RVU   Servers (32,000)) x 2) + client licenses. The end result should be a total amount of  endpoint licenses  that should apply going forward (~600,000). 
Requires the ability to optionally add licenses as needed in increments of 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 (contract options) and all license pricing should be at the matching tier that reflects discounting based off at least 600,000 endpoints 
Currently requires two (2) full-time, on-site  premium support  (legacy AVP) staff that have direct access to BigFix Product Development and may optionally need to add resources in the future at a cost in synch with current costs as contract options.  At least one of the on-site, premium support staff is required to hold a Public High Trust, Top Secret or equivalent clearance for incident response support. 
BigFix must remain TAA Compliant (Trade Agreements Act (TAA), FAR Clause 52.225-5). If TAA compliance is lost at any time the unused portion of the current contract year payment must be refunded within thirty (30) days determined by the yearly cost divided by 12, then multiplied by the months remaining.  
The replacing contract base year cost should not exceed the previous contract option year cost for the same time period. Each option year going forward should not exceed typical, expected out-year costs. No penalties for not-renewing the previous contract option years or for gaps in coverage shall apply. 
Requires and Enterprise Agreement, not just additional QTY/Part numbers.

Currently we are undergoing large sequencing efforts for PIADCs biorepository characterization for transfer to NBAF. We require that this NGS be compatible with both our analysis software (basespace) that is propriety software, and with hi throughput paired reads, with a low error rate.
<p>Illumina is the only manufacturer and distributor for Illumina NGS technology. This technology is covered by a wide range of patents and cannot be replicated by other vendors.</p>
<p>Illumina is only manufacturer and has a patent for the benchmark of NGS, which can do paired end reads, this is important as by pairing reads you can virtually eliminate errors that occur with other technologies. We are currently using a Nextseq500, having an additional machine will allow increased capacity using the same protocols, reagents and the same workflow. Including being compatible with our current analysis software that is patented by Illumina technologies (basespace). Currently Illumina holds all the patents for this technology. In addition we have purchased specialized tools for our NextSeq500 that are required for calibration and set-up that can be utilized on this machine. Tools have to be purchased as the machine will reside in a BSL3 laboratory.</p>

The forest seeks proposals from individuals, governmental, and quasi-governmental agencies, and non-profit or for-profit organizations and educational institutions. Creative responses to this request may accommodate a single management entity or multiple entities. The forest is interested to see what visions there are for the Coldwater Visitor Center facility, and how that vision could be achieved. The Forest is open to new and innovative ideas. The ideas brought forward need not be limited to the Coldwater Visitor Center building, however it should be a prominent component. Responses to this request may identify use of just the Coldwater Visitor Center or contemplate the use of adjacent or nearby recreation developments in the Hwy 504 corridor of the Monument in addition to the facility.
<p>This RFEI is not intended as a formal offering for the award of a contract or for participation in future solicitation. The forest reserves the right, at its sole discretion to: withdraw the RFEI and/or not issue any related or other Request for Proposals; use the ideas or proposals submitted in any manner deemed to be in the best interest of the Forest Service, including, but not limited to, the undertaking of the prescribed work in a manner other than that which is set forth herein. The forest likewise reserves the right at any time to change any components, concepts, or approaches of the RFEI. All costs associated with responding to the RFEI are the sole responsibility of the respondent and any such costs shall not be reimbursed by the Forest Service.<br />A site visit with Forest Service staff will take place on June 25, 2019. During the site visit, interested parties will be able to tour the entire Coldwater Visitor Center, including the basement area that is normally closed to the public.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Galveston District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction/dredging project: Corpus Christi Ship Channel (CCSC) Entrance Channel Jetty Repairs in Nueces and Aransas County, Texas.
<p>The work consists of providing all labor, materials, equipment, transportation, quality control, and supervision necessary to perform placement of bedding stone (80K tons), core stone (100 tons), armor stone (80k tons) and capstone (20K tons) along the north and south CCSC jetties, and construction of a 2,000 LF concrete cap along the south jetty and additional placement of bedding stone core stone, armor stone, and capstone along the north and or south CCSC jetties.<br /><br />The repairs include large portions of the CCSC Jetties where various sizes (up to 16-18 ton) of rectangular armor stone, core stone, and blanket stone will be required to be constructed to specified grades and tolerances both above and below mean lower low water to depths of up to approximately 60'-70'. Jetty repairs will be made in an area with adverse environmental conditions which include an exposed wave/swell climate associated with the Gulf of Mexico and strong currents associated with coastal inlets.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:</p>
<p>The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in the same channel.<br />a. The complexity of the project.<br />b. The ability of the contractor to pump material six and a half miles from dredging cut to placement area.<br />c. The ability to coordinate with U.S. Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service, Pilots, and shipping industry.<br />d. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>PLA Definition: A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:<br />Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction/dredging projects.</p>
<p>An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction/dredging on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and<br />Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction/dredging community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Galveston District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>2. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>3. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>4. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>5. Projects will require multiple construction/dredging contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple marine crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>6. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction/dredging labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>7. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the marine trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>8. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>9. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via e-mail to Jacqueline B. Adekanbi, Contract Specialist at Jacqueline.b.adekanbi@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 PM (CST) on 10 June 2019.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island District, has a requirement to develop preliminary HAZUS Inundation Damage Assessment Maps for non-leveed Iowa communities along the Mississippi River, for the purpose of prioritizing mitigation projects that will reduce recurring flood risk and increase community resiliency.</p>
<p>Frequent and longer duration Mississippi River flood events are becoming more prevalent as currently experienced by this year's April/May flood event. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Association (UMRBA) is hosting a series of open forums June and July 2019, in strategic parts of the Upper Mississippi River System to gain a better understanding of perspectives, and insights from the affected communities. These forums will identify and document significant areas of risk and uncertainty. Inundation Damage Assessment Maps will be available at the forums to facilitate risk communication discussion. The inundation maps are used to assess areas of repetitive flooding, locate individual or clusters of flood prone structures, determine which structures incur the most frequent or severe losses, evaluate mitigation measures and assist in prioritizing mitigation projects for the purpose of reducing flood risk and increasing community resiliency.</p>
<p>As implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold and only one source reasonably available. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island District, intends to enter into a firm fixed-price purchase order with the University of Iowa--The Iowa Flood Center (Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research)</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Unison Marketplace is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Unison Marketplace will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA
22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation: No. NIMH-19-004516 includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2019-1 simplified procedures for commercial items. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.
<p>This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 333314 with a size standard of 500 Employees is being considered.<br />Only one award will be made because of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), plans to procure One Mango OPA with Input average power: up to 50W, Input energy: up to 500uJ, Conversion efficiency: &gt; 12 % at the peak (signal + idler), Pulse duration: &lt; 300 fs and Wavelength range: 630 - 1020 nm / 1040 - 2600 nm (MUST BE COMPATIBLE WITH HIGH POWER ULTRAFAST FIBR LASER- SATSUMA HP2) ; One (1) Mango 1&mu;m bypass option; and installation. OFFER FOR OPAS THAT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE HIGH POWER ULTRAFAST FIBER LASER (SATSUMA HP2) WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. The Unit on Neural Computation and Behavior requires an Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) to perform cellular imaging and stimulation. This OPA will receive input pulses from a fiber amplified laser. This laser will increase the wavelength with the same polarization while offering shorter pulses and complete dispersion management for applications requiring high peak intensity.<br /><br />The Unit on Neural Computation and Behavior studies the function of cortical network activity in vivo using single-cell optogenetic stimulation. A single stimulus or motor action changes the activity of many cells in the cerebral cortex, and it is thought that patterns of activity across many cells are the fundamental unit of cortical function. However, we have been unable to understand how the brain uses activity patterns across multiple cells, principally because, as a field, we have been unable to change the activity of multiple individual cells in a patterned way. Two-photon optogenetic stimulation can provide such control, and thus has enormous promise to reveal how the brain works. Several groups worldwide, including our group, are working to deploy this approach in behaving animals. To do this, we develop custom optical microscopes which are able to both image and stimulate neurons using high-pulse power lasers. The equipment supports the research mission of the Unit and Institute. We are in need of an OPA that can deliver any wavelength from 210 nm to 11,000 nm from the same output port with the same polarization for ultimate ease of use while offering shorter pulses and complete dispersion management for applications requiring high peak intensity. We have an existing laser from Amplitude/Continuum that the OPA we are purchasing must integrate with seamlessly without the requisite need to purchase additional software, hardware, and components.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics that apply to this acquisition are as follows:</p>
<p>The Unit on Neural Computation and Behavior requires an Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) to perform cellular imaging and stimulation. The Optical Parametric Amplifier must have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>1. Laser with input pulses at 1040nm+-5nm center and have &lt; 350fs duration<br />2. Laser must produce pulse durations &lt; 300 fs and produce output pulses in range 630-1020nm and 1040-2600nm. <br />3. Laser must have a bypass path where the fiber input pulses can pass through the OPA undisturbed when required.<br />4. Laser must produce pulses at 500 kHz. <br />5. All selected wavelengths must be able to exit from same output port with the same polarization. <br />6. Laser must be air-cooled (to meet installation needs). <br />7. Laser must be able to accommodate &gt; 200uJ and 50W of input power and shall be field-tested to function at 40 uJ / 20W. <br />8. Laser must produce &gt; 12% efficiency (field-tested with 40uJ pump to produce &gt; 4.8 uJ) at peak, and &gt; 5% efficiency over the wavelength ranges 700-920nm and 1160nm-1800nm.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /><br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />JSATS Acoustic Tagging Services</p>
<p>I.	Background/Overview:</p>
<p>This SOW seeks to implement the acoustic tag implantation component of the Trawl Efficiency Project. The acoustic tagged fish are part of a much larger batch release of hatchery Chinook salmon juveniles of which all are also marked with a adipose fin clip and a coded wire tag (CWT). A small fraction of these fish are expected to be captured at two of the USWFS Juvenile Fish Monitoring trawl net sampling sites at Sacramento and Chipps Island. The acoustic tagged portion of these release groups will provide an estimate of survival of the entire batch release to those monitoring sites. With this information it is possible to estimate the capture efficiency of the trawl net sampling. Acoustic tag fish should be representative of the larger batch of hatchery fish.</p>
<p>II.	Scope of Work<br />Fish tagging services.</p>
<p>III.	Tasks<br />&bull;	Task 1 - Person's names with documents showing JSATS tag implantation experience and fish tag implantation training for the surgeons to be present at tagging events.</p>
<p>&bull;	Task 2 - provide at least five persons to assist with implantation of up to 800 JSATS transmitters into juvenile Chinook of 80-150mm fork length at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery near Anderson, CA.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br /> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) CLAUSES:</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018) In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassmentby or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. (a) Definitions. Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexualabuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. SexualHarassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: &bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; &bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; &bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures. A (b) Requirements. 1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. 2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. 3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). 4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace<br />a.     Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. 5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. (c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experiencedsexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: &#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 &#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org &#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) &#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265 (d) Confidentiality. Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />b.    (e) Remedies. In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: 1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; 2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; 3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; 4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; 5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>
<p>NAM 1330-523.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52-.237-70 CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS (APR 2010) <br />(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1.	Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2.	When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.<br /> (b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.<br />(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.<br />b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3.

<DESC>Dear Prospective Offerors:
<p>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking offers from qualified resident-hire U.S. citizens to provide personal services under contract as described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>This position of Development Communications Outreach Specialist (DOCS) is located within the Program Development Office (PDO), USAID/Vietnam Mission. PDO provides strategic, programmatic, evaluation and budgeting guidance to the Mission to implement a portfolio of programs of more than $115 million annually. PDO also manages external communications and relations with partners, donors, host country institutions, Washington, and the general public. Details about the Mission's portfolio may be found at http://vietnam.usaid.gov.</p>
<p>One essential function of PDO is to lead the Mission's external outreach and communications efforts. Given the history of U.S.-Vietnam relations and the particular sensitivity of a number of program areas in which we work, the DOCS plays a central role in defining our programs and explaining them to Vietnamese, American, and international audiences.</p>
<p>The DOCS is responsible for collecting, researching, managing, and distributing information associated with the USAID &lsquo;s programs in Vietnam and serves as the point of contact and liaison for all public information requests. The DOCS's recommendations on development outreach will assist USAID senior leadership in making strategic decisions, related to communications, messaging, and press relations. The incumbent collaborates closely with USAID/Vietnam technical teams (Economic Growth and Governance; Health; Environment and Social Development; and Higher Education) and numerous implementing partners to develop and implement USAID/Vietnam's overall development outreach communications strategy. S/he collaborates with the U.S. Embassy/Hanoi's Public Affairs Officer (PAO) to ensure that Embassy personnel are properly apprised of USAID program activities, achievements, and public events. The Vietnam DOCS will coordinate Mission efforts and liaise with the Agency's Legislative and Public Affairs Bureau in Washington (USAID/W).</p>
<p>The primary duty of this DOCS position is to implement USAID/Vietnam's communications strategy. As one of several DOCS positions in south-east Asia, it is important that the incumbent work with DOCS in neighboring missions and share information that will help tell the story effectively of USAID's programs throughout the region. As part of the DOCS duties, close collaboration with USAID's Regional Development Mission Asia (RDMA) and USAID/Washington is essential. <br />Offers must be in accordance with Attachment 1 of this solicitation. Incomplete or unsigned offers will not be considered. Offerors should retain copies of all offer materials for their records.</p>
<p>This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a PSC contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the offer.</p>
<p>Any questions must be directed in writing to the Point of Contact specified in Attachment 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Ken Seifert<br />Contracting Officer</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

A written solicitation will not be posted.<br /><br />1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), serves as the nationwide program and project management service provider for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Professional Land Survey Services for CBP extend the entire southern border of the United States with Mexico, which primarily encompasses the four states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. The contracts to be awarded under this acquisition strategy/plan are primarily intended to support Professional Land Survey Services for the border infrastructure program along the Southwestern Border of the United States, but may also be used in support of other Professional Land Survey Service needs for USACE programs within the boundaries of the Southwestern Division (SWD) and the South Pacific Division (SPD). <br /><br />The Professional Land Survey Services procured under these contracts may include, but are not limited to the following: Boundary surveying for the transfer of land, creation of land tracts or parcels, preparation of easements, preparation of legal descriptions for the transfer of land or easements, identification of boundary discrepancies, location of property improvements, mapping of encroachments, the mapping of identified areas, preparation of metes &amp; bounds descriptions, acquisition and preparation of topographic surveying data, performance of hydrographic surveying, creation of documents or maps required for zoning classifications and may include other services that are professionally, historically or generally provided as service by a professional license land surveyor. <br /><br />USACE intends to award a target of ten Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) as a Total Small Business Set-Aside pool with a shared $240 million award capacity. This solicitation seeks a pool of contractors who demonstrate the competence and qualifications to meet Professional Land Surveying requirements at fair and reasonable prices. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. The highest qualified candidates shall be selected to negotiate fair and reasonable price rates. The rates will be negotiated for the base period as well as for the option period. If the rate negotiations do not result in an agreement, the Government will terminate the negotiations with the selected candidate and will then negotiate with the next highest ranked candidate. <br /><br />Each contract will have a base ordering period of three (3) years plus two (2) twelve-month option periods. All task orders will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The option period may be exercised at the discretion of the Contracting Officer prior to the base period expiring. The selected contractors will be placed into a pool of contractors. <br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Architecture and engineering services are required for various military and civil works projects. All work must be performed by or under the direct supervision of a licensed professional surveyor. The contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations as well as with all U.S. Army Corps of Engineers engineering and planning criteria. <br /><br />It is estimated that there will be 366 requirements over the five year period for which individual task orders may be issued. These task orders will be issued as needed and each task order will have its own schedule for project completion. Task Orders will be evaluated based upon level of effort for the scope of services developed for individual projects. All task orders issued will be negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders and will be issued under the terms and conditions of this Indefinite Delivery Contract. The Government shall be under no obligation to issue any particular number or types of orders and no liability to the contractor shall be incurred in the event that a certain number or types of orders are not issued. The minimum guaranteed amount is $2,500.00 (Two Thousand and Five Hundred Dollars) for the base contract period only. There is no minimum guarantee for any subsequent option periods. The minimum task order amount is $30,000 and the maximum task order amount is $2,000,000, however, firms may agree to accept requirements outside these parameters.<br /><br />Antiterrorism and Operations Security (AT/OPSEC) requirements as well as E-Verify (employment) will be required for all Military or Civil Works Infrastructure projects. For other tasks, determination will be made per individual task order.<br /><br />The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 with a small business size standard of $15,000,000.00. <br /><br />3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below. Criteria A thru E are primary. Criteria F is secondary and will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. Primary criteria are all of equal importance.<br /><br />A.

The hip system provides options for the following different hip stems which include the Summit, Trilock, solution, AMI, and reclaim.The system includes head sizes from 22mm to 40m in both ceramic and metal options. The hip system should offer five different primary stems and a cemented stem. The design of the extra medullary section improves the biomechanics of the stem. The low profile neck increases the range increases the range of motion of the stem within the cup before the neck impinges on the cup. The AMT taper (ARTICUL/EZE Mini Taper) captures completely the femoral head reducing on the grit-blasted surface. The HA coated medial to lateral taper resists axial/torsional stresses and promotes osteointegration for optimum fixation. The design of the stem, with its titanium alloy and its full hydroxyapatite coating should ensure load transfer without abnormal peak forces and allows a very low incidence on thigh pain.

(a)  Basis of Award.  This procurement is being conducted pursuant to FAR Part13 procedures.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, quotes the lowest price, whose quoted price does not exceed the amount of funding available for the procurement, and whose quoted price is found to be reasonable.  Price alone is the sole evaluation factor.  In addition to the general standards of responsibility found at FAR  9.104-1, in accordance with FAR  9.104-2, the special standards of responsibility described below apply to this procurement.  Offerors who fail to meet any special standard of responsibility will not be eligible to receive contract award.

SP2: Special Licensure.  Offeror shall employ licensed Nuclear Pharmacists to oversee daily operations. A license for each pharmacist shall be provided.

SP3: Regulatory Requirements.  Offeror shall meet all USNRC/Agreement State, Department of Transportation, Federal Drug Administration (FDA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Pharmacy/Pharmacist Licensing requirements (Federal and State) as well as any applicable Joint Commission requirements.

(b) Evaluation Process.  Quotes will be evaluated in the following manner.  The lowest-priced quote] will be identified.  The lowest-priced quote will be evaluated to determine if the quoted price exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement.  If the  quoted price does not exceed the amount of funding available for the procurement, the quoted price will be evaluated to determine if it is reasonable.  If the quoted price is found to be reasonable, the offeror who submitted this quote will be identified as the  successful offeror.   The contracting officer will then determine if the successful offeror is responsible using the general standards of responsibility and the special standards of responsibility applicable to this procurement.  If contract award cannot be made to the successful offeror, the contracting officer will evaluate the next lowest-priced quote following the procedures described above.  This process will continue until a contract award can be made, or the contracting officer determines that no contract award can be made.  The contracting officer may find all quotes not acceptable and cancel the solicitation if the lowest-priced quote exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement.  The contracting officer may likewise find a quote under evaluation, as well as all remaining quotes, not acceptable and cancel the solicitation if the quote currently under evaluation exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement.  The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions at any time if determined by the contracting officer to be in the Government s interest.

(c) Options.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced or if the quoted price for the basic requirement or any option exceeds the amount of funding available for any of those requirements.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under USPSCs. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition, stabilization, and conflict mitigation programs, to provide support and guidance for country program staff to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI program activities in the field.</p>
<p>OTI's success now and in the future depends in large part on its ability to achieve an overarching organizational goal: the effective transfer and ongoing analysis of knowledge and experience - comprised of values, management processes, lessons learned, best practices, standards, and innovations - in real time, with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include: OTI staff in the field and headquarters; OTI's implementing partners around the world; USAID Missions overseas; other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington D.C.; other U.S. government agencies and branches; other donors; other transition, stabilization and reconstruction practitioners; host government and/or other local counterparts; and the U.S. public. All of the above increases OTI's level of transparency and accountability.<br /> <br />To this end, the OTI ABC Team supports a model of organizational learning across the office that ensures:</p>
<p>1.	Increased transparency and accountability between the headquarters and field teams;<br />2.	Increased opportunities for peer-to-peer dialogue;<br />3.	Easier access to content and learning resources for a variety of stakeholders;<br />4.	More guidance available in online format;<br />5.	Provision of tools to surface and apply OTI's programming lessons to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of OTI programs.</p>
<p>The M&amp;E Specialist supports OTI's mission to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs by building the knowledge, skills and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve country program performance. The M&amp;E Specialist does this by: designing and providing innovative solutions that are adapted to OTI's fast-paced global needs; developing and facilitating learning and training events; and providing support services ranging from procurement to linkages with private sector partners. ABC supports learning and innovation through the application of technology - including OTI's knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools - to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance. ABC will ensure the effective integration of lessons and knowledge into OTI's learning and training resources. ABC coordinates closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Does our generator need to provide 81.18A x 1.20 = 98.16A.&nbsp; Please clarify.<br />&nbsp;<br />Response 1: The generator needs to be capable of providing 98.16A during steady-state.&nbsp; The table icontains the nominal loads and do not include the 20% margin.<br /><br />All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p align="left">(d) Performance of this contract may require the contractor to access and use</p>
<p align="left">data and information, proprietary to the judiciary or to a judiciary contractor,</p>
<p align="left">which is of such a nature that its dissemination or use, other than in performance</p>
<p align="left">of this contract, would be adverse to the interests of the judiciary and/or others.</p>
<p align="left">(e) Contractor and/or contractor personnel shall not divulge or release data or</p>
<p align="left">information developed or obtained in performance of this contract until made</p>
<p align="left">public by the judiciary, except as authorized by the contracting officer. The</p>
<p align="left">contractor shall not use, disclose, or reproduce proprietary data which bears a</p>
<p align="left">restrictive legend, other than as required in the performance of this contract.</p>
<p align="left">Nothing herein will preclude the use of any data independently acquired by the</p>
<p align="left">contractor without such limitations or prohibit an agreement at no cost to the</p>
<p align="left">judiciary between the contractor and the data owner which provides for greater</p>
<p align="left">rights to the contractor.</p>
<p align="left">(f) The judiciary and contractor agree that neither expects the performance under</p>
<p align="left">this contract to involve reporting or handling of classified information or materials.</p>
<p align="left">Either party shall notify the other promptly in writing if the expectation of that</p>
<p align="left">party changes, and shall include in the notice reasons therefore. If there are</p>
<p align="left">sealed records, in camera proceedings or grand jury matters, the contractor shall</p>
<p align="left">consult with the contracting officer as to the proper safeguarding, security, and</p>
<p align="left">secrecy of the original notes and transcript orders.</p>
<p align="left">(g) The contracting officer will advise the contractor whenever the judiciary</p>
<p align="left">places a service order which will require classified information or materials. The</p>
<p align="left">contractor will have the right to decline to provide services, in which event such</p>
<p align="left">services shall be outside the scope of this contract.</p>
<p align="left">(h) The contractor shall hold inviolate and in strictest confidence any and all</p>
<p align="left">information of an official nature not for inclusion in the document, any information</p>
<p align="left">which the presiding judicial official designates as "off the record" and all classified</p>
<p align="left">information and material.</p>
<p align="left">(i) The contractor shall classify, safeguard, and otherwise act with respect to all</p>
<p align="left">classified information and material in accordance with applicable law and</p>
<p align="left">requirements of the contracting officer. The contractor shall not permit any</p>
<p align="left">individual to have or gain access to the classified information or material without</p>
<p align="left">written permission of the contracting officer, except as access may be necessary</p>
<p align="left">for authorized employees of the contractor to perform services under this</p>
<p align="left">contract.</p>
<p align="left">(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, the contractor may deliver</p>
<p align="left">transcript containing classified material or information only to the judiciary. The</p>
<p align="left">contractor shall never sell or deliver such document to a private person without</p>
<p align="left">the express written permission of the contracting officer. Notwithstanding any</p>
<p align="left">other provision of this contract, the contractor shall never keep a copy of a</p>
<p align="left">document containing classified material or information after the delivery of the</p>
<p align="left">original to the contracting officer.</p>
<p align="left">JP3 Clause 7-120, Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year <strong>(JAN 2003)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond</p>
<p align="left">September 30, 2015. The judiciary's obligation for performance of this contract</p>
<p align="left">beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from</p>
<p align="left">which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part</p>
<p align="left">of the judiciary for any payment may arise for performance under this contract</p>
<p align="left">beyond October 1, 2015, until funds are made available to the contracting officer</p>
<p align="left">for performance and until the contractor receives notice of availability, to be</p>
<p align="left">confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.</p>
<p align="left">JP3 Clause 7-125, Invoices (JAN 2003)</p>
<p align="left">(a) Invoices shall be submitted in an original and two (2) copies to the address</p>
<p align="left">specified on the SF 26 or SF 33 as applicable, or as otherwise specified with this</p>
<p align="left">contract. Invoices shall be submitted in accordance with the schedule for</p>
<p align="left">payments as set forth elsewhere under this contract.</p>
<p align="left">(b) The office that will make payments due under this contract will be designated</p>
<p align="left">as specified in the contract at the time of contract award.</p>
<p align="left">(c) To constitute a proper invoice, the billing document shall include the following</p>
<p align="left">information and/or attached documentation:</p>
<p align="left">(1) name of business concern and such business's Taxpayer Identification</p>
<p align="left">Number;</p>
<p align="left">(2) period(s) covered by invoice and invoice date;</p>
<p align="left">(3) purchase/delivery/task order or contract number or other authorization</p>
<p align="left">for delivery of property or services;</p>
<p align="left">(4) for each line item - general description of product delivered or services</p>
<p align="left">rendered, measured unit, and associated price;</p>
<p align="left">(5) payment terms;</p>
<p align="left">(6) total amount billed;</p>
<p align="left">(7) a subtotal of any and all fees or credits applied to the invoice<strong>;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">(8) an amount due (if any) or credit balance;</p>
<p align="left">(9) name (where practicable), title, phone number, fax number, and</p>
<p align="left">complete mailing address of the responsible official to whom payment is to</p>
<p align="left">be sent. The "remit to" address shall correspond to the remittance address</p>
<p align="left">in the contract;</p>
<p align="left">(10) other substantiating documentation or information as required by the</p>
<p align="left">purchase/delivery/task order or contract;</p>
<p align="left">(11) all follow-up invoices shall be marked "Duplicate of Original."</p>
<p align="left">Contractor questions regarding payment information or check identification</p>
<p align="left">shall be directed to the relevant paying authority specified in the contract.</p>
<p align="left">JP3 Clause 7-130, Interest (Prompt Payment) (JAN 2003)</p>
<p align="left">The provisions of the Prompt Payment Act of 1982 and OMB Budget Circular A-</p>
<p align="left">125 concerning interest on overdue payments are not applicable to the judiciary.</p>
<p align="left">Therefore, interest is not payable under this contract for overdue payments.</p>
<p align="left">JP3 Clause 7-140, Discounts for Prompt Payment (JAN 2003)</p>
<p align="left">(a) Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of</p>
<p align="left">offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be</p>
<p align="left">taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the</p>
<p align="left">offeror. As an alternative to offering a discount for prompt payment in conjunction</p>
<p align="left">with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include discounts for prompt</p>
<p align="left">payment on individual invoices.</p>
<p align="left">(b) In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time will be</p>
<p align="left">computed from the date of the invoice. If the contractor has not placed a date on</p>
<p align="left">the invoice, the due date will be calculated from the date the designated billing</p>
<p align="left">office receives a proper invoice, provided the judiciary annotates such invoice</p>
<p align="left">with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the</p>
<p align="left">discount earned, payment will be considered to have been made on the date that</p>
<p align="left">appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified</p>
<p align="left">payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal</p>
<p align="left">holiday when judiciary offices are closed and judiciary business is not expected</p>
<p align="left">to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p align="left">JP3 Clause 7-223 Termination for Convenience of the Judiciary (Short Form) (AUG</p>
<p align="left">2004)</p>
<p align="left">The contracting officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or</p>
<p align="left">in part, when it is in the judiciary's interest. If this contract is terminated, the</p>
<p align="left">judiciary shall be liable only for payment under the payment provisions of this</p>
<p align="left">contract for products received or services rendered before the effective date of</p>
<p>termination.</p>

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Announcement is to assist Combat Capabilities Development Command-Soldier Center (CCDC-Soldier Center) to identify potential sources to provide a chemisorption/ physisorption/ chemical vapor sorption instrument.</p>
<p>The Government requests that responses be submitted electronically to mary.k.prebensen.civ@mail.mil and molly.n.richards2.civ@mail.mil by May 25, 2019 by 5pm EST.</p>
<p>Background: The Government (CCDC Soldier Center) is in need of an instrument capable of measuring physisorption, chemisorption, and vapor sorption of microporous materials. Present specifications require a total of 3 ports: 2 ports for mesopore/BET analysis with 1000 Torr transducers, and 1 port with 10 and 0.1 Torr transducers for micropore analysis. Analysis gases and chemical vapors compatible with the instrument must include nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, butane, hydrogen sulfide, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), and dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP). Materials used with the instrument must be compatible with these chemicals such that corrosion, absorption, degradation over time, and leaks are not an issue.</p>
<p>Description: The following specifications are required:<br />&bull; The system detailed must have at total of 3 analysis ports/stations and at least 3 degassing stations. The analysis stations must include at least one port capable of physisorption, at least one port capable of chemisorption, and at least 1 port capable of vapor sorption. It is acceptable if a single port is capable of both chemisorption and vapor sorption.<br />&bull; At least one port should have a transducer for micropore analysis, and ports not enabled for micropore analysis must be enabled for mesopore analysis.<br />&bull; The system will include a TCD option for temperature programmed reactions. Temperature range will reach 1100 C in the manifold. Low temperature ranges will also be achievable using cryogenic cooling, with the ability to refill the cryogen dewar without interrupting ongoing experiments.<br />&bull; The system must be able to analyze gasses including: ammonia, hydrogen sulfide. The system must be able to analyze vapors generated from several chemical warfare simulants, including: dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP), 2-ethyl ethyl chloride (2-CEES). This requires the system to have adequate safety mechanisms in place to work with such chemicals. Materials used within the instrument must ensure no corrosion, absorption, degradation, and/or leaks into the atmosphere. Preferred features include, but not limited, chemical resistant coatings, o-rings, connections, and metal-to-metal seals in the manifold to prevent sorption or reaction with the compounds used. The vapor source must be from the gas inlets, and have an isolation valve. <br />&bull; The system must also be able to operate inside a fume hood, or be vented to a fume hood to allow any harmful vapors and gasses to vent properly.<br />&bull; Everything connected to the system must be independent from laboratory facilities and not plumbed into any standing facilities. This includes air needs (such as air compressors, vacuum pumps) and temperature regulation (such as recirculating water baths, chillers, cryogen jacket).<br />&bull; Training for new users must take place with installation.</p>
<p>Deliverables: <br />1. Chemisorption/physisorption/chemical vapor sorption instrument:<br />&bull; Physisorption - 1 port capable micropore analysis (10 torr and 0.1 torr transducers), 2 ports capable standard mesopore/BET analysis (1000 torr transducers) <br />&bull; chemisorption (1 station capable); vapor sorption (1 station capable)<br />&bull; TCD for temperature programmed reactions<br />&bull; high precision, programmable mass flow controllers<br />&bull; furnace up to 1100 degrees Celsius; <br />&bull; Stainless steel gas inlets, chemical resistant fittings and manifold<br />&bull; Cryogen controlled by isothermal jacket<br />2. Vacuum preparation station: For degassing multiple samples<br />3. Software and licensing: Windows 10 compatible<br />4. Chemisorption operating supplies: 6 months supply<br />5. Chemisorption O-ring kit / supplies / reference materials <br />6. Chemisorption quartz sample tubes: Minimum of 2<br />7. TCD Operating supplies: 6 months supply<br />8. Physisorption sample tube kit / supplies / reference materials<br />9. Physisorption O-ring and seal kit / supplies / reference materials<br />10. Vapor source option: With heating mantle and isolation valve<br />11. Pressure regulator assemblies: CGA fitting (N2, He, Ar, Kr)<br />12. Pressure regulator assemblies: CGA fitting (H2, CO)<br />13. Computer system: Dell laptop, Windows 10 machine, TPM 2.0<br />14. Identify Shipping, Handling, and Delivery costs<br />15. Install and User Familiarization: Installation and training on instrument for multiple users (up to 4 users)<br />16. Provide Warranty for 1 year<br />17. Facility needs: As required by instrument to replace facility requirements: Vacuum pump system, air compressor, recirculating chiller, etc.</p>
<p>Delivery Date: The Government anticipates 20 weeks lead time for this item. Please identify timeframe required for delivery.</p>

<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Field Acquisition Office, Grand Prairie, TX, intends to issue solicitation <strong>15B41419Q00000001</strong> for the provision of Dialysis Needles &amp; Blood Tubing Supplies. The supplies will be provided to individuals who are under the custody and care of the Federal Bureau of Prisons within a secure correctional environment, located at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (USMCFP), Springfield, MO. The physical address is USMCFP Springfield, 1900 West Sunshine Street, Springfield, MO 65807-2240. The contract type is an indefinite delivery/requirements contract with firm-fixed unit price. The award will be made to the responsible vendor or individual who submits the best value to the Government based on Price, Past Performance and Technical. Technical will be evaluated based on conformance to a set number of cases delivered by the 15th of each month as stated in the solicitation. The Bureau of Prisons requires Medisystems Hemodialysis Stream Line Blood Tubing and Arterial/Venous Fistula Needle set with Masterguard Anti-Stick Needle Protector 15 gauge x 1" for the Dialysis Department at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (USMCFP) located in Springfield, Missouri. Due to the care level of USMCFP, hemodialysis is ran six days a week for 12 hours each day for chronic and/or acute renal failure patients. This is an existing requirement and provides the compatibility and safety measures required that is critical to patient care and staff safety in the Dialysis Unit.</p>
<p>USMCFP currently has 56 Fresenius 2008T with Acetic Acid/Vinegar Jug hemodialysis machines in the Dialysis Unit. The requested blood tubing is specifically calibrated to our transonic machine, which is calibrated to the tubing diameter and to each dialysis machine. The requested needles are required to provide safety measures from accidental needle sticks for the Dialysis staff. The specific safety features of this needle are covered by one or more of the following patents: 5112311; 5266072; 5433703; 5562637; 5704924; and 5951529. Specifically, the Masterguard finger shield feature allows for the nurses finger which is moving the shield to be up and out of the way of direct contact with the needle and skin surface of the inmate while sliding the shield into place over the needle. Additionally, this safety feature still allows complete visualization of the needle and site while being either placed or removed with the other hand. This safety feature is unique to the Medisystems brand.</p>
<p>There are 56 dialysis machines. Dialysis runs six days a week, 12 hours a day. Procuring any other type of dialysis tubing would require recalibration of all machines resulting in significant down time and delay in medical treatment. Failure to purchase a fistula needle that has this specific safety mechanism historically proven to be safe would be detrimental to staff. Failure to procure the above items would affect patient care, staff safety and the orderly running of the institution. The use of the Medisystems brand for blood tubing and fistula needles is essential to the Government's requirements for the above reasons, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administrations (FAAs) Communications, Information and Network Programs (CINP) Group provides life-cycle management for the support and transformation of FAAs enterprise communications services to meet evolving National Airspace System (NAS) and non-NAS requirements. This market survey is being conducted by the Voice Switching and Recording Program Office within CINP. The Voice Switching and Recording Program Office within CINP is requesting information from industry to support future voice communications acquisitions.
In the past year, CINP has released other market surveys seeking information for related but separate activities. Refer to Attachment 1 - Relevant FAA Market Surveys. This market survey addresses the Air Traffic Control voice communication requirement. The FAA intends to engage in a series of industry exchanges in the development of these future acquisitions. More detail will be provided in future FAA Contracting Opportunities announcements (https://faaco.faa.gov).
The FAA is looking for feedback regarding part or all of the strategy described in this survey. Feedback regarding real experiences with respect to the use of VoIP in ATC, industry lessons learned, alternate solutions, and information for existing products is explicitly sought.
This is not a screening information request (SIR) or request for proposal. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of fulfilling the FAAs requirements. The FAA may, at its option, invite certain respondents to one-on-one meetings for further questions.

<DESC>The Government is considering removing usage of a unit price book from this acquisition.&nbsp; Effectively we are pursuing the option to change from a Job Order Contract (JOC) type to a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) type contract.
<p>We are actively drafting ordering procedures for this shift from a JOC type and will publish a draft Statement of Work (SOW) when it is available. <br /><br />Task Order proposals would not be tied to a unit price book and allow open competition amongst master IDIQ awardees&nbsp;(eradicating necessity of bidding a co-efficient at base contract award).</p>
<p>We welcome any feedback on this potential shift in acquisition strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the removal of a price book&nbsp;makes this opportunity&nbsp;more&nbsp;appealing to your firm and makes it more likely you will propose on our requirement please submit a formal sources sought response.&nbsp; The responses are critical in making set-aside decisions prior to solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Thank you for your continued interest and patience with our development of this requirement.&nbsp; Please see the below changes and updates to the notification.&nbsp; Also please review the attached draft Statement of Work.<br /><br />This acquisition has&nbsp;changed from a Job Order Contract (JOC) type to a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) type contract.
<p>While we continue to develop a draft Solicitation we have completed a draft Statement of Work (SOW).&nbsp; We are requesting industry feedback on our drafted SOW not later than 5 June 2019.&nbsp; We welcome any comments especially those that identify vague explanations or those that you believe may drive unnecessary costs or those specifications that if unchanged may result in your firm deciding not to compete for the contract.<br /><br />The following has been approved as an initial strategy and is NOT finalized.&nbsp; The information is provided to help us in the final phases of shaping our requirement to best meet Government and Industry interests.&nbsp; We welcome any comments on the following strategy.<br /><br />Planned Strategy:<br /><br />Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) with up to 4 contracts awarded.&nbsp; We are still evaluating the possibiliy of including an on and off ramp clause in the contract.&nbsp; If this occurs under or non-performing Contractors may be off-ramped and additional Contractors may be on ramped onto the contract.&nbsp; You'll noticed our SOW currently states that the Government desires a propoal for each Contractor on every Task Order, however, we are stating that approximately competing on 80% of annual task order requests for proposal would be sufficient to remain in good standing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Currently planning on a five year base period with a single two year option.&nbsp; <br /><br />Past performance will likely not be considered relevant unless physical construction occured north of the 60th parallel.&nbsp; We realize based on some of your sources sought responses this may cause concern.&nbsp; We must be able to draw the line somewhere as we require contractors with experience in similar extreme evniornments such as Anchorage's sub-arctic location/conditions.&nbsp; We welcome any feedback on this topic.<br /><br />Currently anticipating a total small business set-aside.<br /><br />The current estimated date of Soliciation Release is mid August 2019 with estimated Contract award early 2020.</p>

<DESC><p>The US Army Medical Materiel Development Activity's (USAMMDA's) mission is to develop and deliver quality medical capabilities to protect, treat, and sustain the health of our Service Members. The Joint Program Committee - 6's (JPC-6's) mission seeks to drive medical innovation through the development of knowledge and materiel solutions for the acute and early management of combat-related trauma.</p>
<p>ECLS is administered to critically ill patients suffering from life-threatening renal injuries. Although this is a life-saving intervention, current technology is limited by the immense logistical footprint required to support these devices. Current standard of care ECLS devices that provide support to the kidneys require ~70L of replacement fluid per patient per day. This is an immense logistical burden in the far forward environment where supply lines are limited or non-existent making the support of these devices infeasible. Therefore, the aim of this effort is to reduce the amount of replacement fluid required to support these patients in a logistically constrained environment.</p>
<p>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), in support of the USAMMDA Combat Trauma and Acute Rehabilitation (CTAR) Project Management Office (PMO) and JPC-6, is soliciting for research and development (R&amp;D) services to: (1) develop a small, lightweight, rugged ECLS device that provides continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to critically injured patients using less than or equal to 0.5 Liters (L) of replacement fluid per patient per day; (2) conduct necessary clinical trials to support U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submission; and (3) obtain FDA clearance for the device.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that the solicitation will result in the award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee R&amp;D contract, with up to thirty-six (36) months of performance. The Government's objectives are outlined in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code selected for this acquisition is 541715-Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology); and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside. Award shall be made on a competitive basis, using the best value tradeoff process among cost and non-cost factors described at FAR 15.101-1. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>Those interested in obtaining the solicitation can access it at the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov and search for solicitation W81XWH-19-R-0036. Vendors wishing to submit an offer are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP (and accompanying exhibits/attachments) and for frequently monitoring the site for any amendments. Requests made by phone will not be accepted. No solicitations will be provided by hard copy, fax, or e-mail. Failure to respond to the electronically posted RFP and associated amendments prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals specified on the solicitation may render vendor offer non-responsive and result in rejection of the same. The Government is not responsible for any loss of internet connectivity or for an Offeror's inability to access the documents posted at the referenced website.</p>
<p>Solicitation Release Date: 24 May 2019<br />Question Submission Date: 03 June 2019, 8AM ET<br />Proposal Submission Date: 24 June 2019, 3PM ET<br />Anticipated Award Date: 23 September 2019</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award or payment from any Department of Defense activity, Offerors must provide registration information to the System for Award Management (SAM)*. All Offerors must be registered in SAM for "All Awards" prior to receiving an award. The Offeror's SAM record must be active and should include the NAICS that has been selected for this procurement. An entity can be registered in SAM under multiple NAICS if they are applicable to the entity's business. EARLY REGISTRATION IS ADVISED. Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished, at www.sam.gov. This includes the online representations and certifications located within SAM.</p>
<p>*Entities registering in SAM must submit a notarized letter appointing their authorized Entity Administrator. Please note that the instructions for domestic and international entities differ. It is recommended that Offerors allow sufficient time to complete the SAM registration process.

<DESC>Michigan's Public Safety Communications Interoperability Board provides statewide interoperability communications on the 800/700 MHz radio system and telecommunications network. Michigan's Public Safety Communications System (MPSCS) is the only entity authorized to add and activate the OHARNG Marcs radio serial numbers to facilitate their use on the network. This network access and activation is required as it is the only statewide repeated network that the OHARNG can utilize with the Marcs radios. Currently, OHARNG has an agreement with the State of Michigan to use the network with approximately 15 radios/serial numbers. However, additional serial number activations are necessary at this time to continue mission capability for increased units convoying to and training in Grayling, Michigan. The MPSCS maintains a voice, data, and fire paging fee structure (19 January 2016) which sets the fee for mobile, portable, control station, consolette, and initial activation voice fee at $250 per unit/serial number. OHARNG seeks to activate 47 serial numbers. The price of $11,750 reflects the $250 activation fee multiplied by the 47 units. This fee was set by the MPSCS and is listed as a policy directive for the State of Michigan.gov.

No quotes came in technically acceptable. eMICP #1 is now back in the Portsmouth, VA area. From previous experience on a similar requirement that was solicited in the Portsmouth, VA area to multiple contractors, we know there is only one reasonably available source that has John Deere trained technicians in the local area.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (Domestic Contracting)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1.	The Office of Mobile Security Deployments (DS/T/MSD) recommends that the Department of State Acquisitions Management use other than full and open competition for the facilities rental needed to support specialized tactical training scheduled June 16- 29, 2019. The vendor: Academi Training Center {dba ACADEMI: DUNS 012418161), PO Box 1029, 850 Puddio Ridge Road, Moyock, North Carolina 27958-8679. The estimated cost is $.</p>
<p><br />2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved</p>
<p>The acquisition and pricing are based on existing Contract Number GS07F0149K.<br />This justification is for acquisition of facilities at Academi Training Center to accommodate specialized tactical training June 16 - 29, 2019</p>
<p>3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs.</p>
<p>In order to support the Bureau's mission of providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of&nbsp;U.S. foreign policy, MSD performs three primary missions: Integrated Mobile Training Team (IMTT) missions provide security training and exercises for overseas posts, Security Support Team (SST) missions provide enhanced security for overseas posts, and Tactical Support Team (TST) missions provide a counter-assault capability for domestic and overseas protective security details. MSD agents are required to receive intensive tactical security training to accomplish SST and TST missions. Part of this preparedness raining includes armament team training. MSD conducts training in a wide variety of tactical measures designed to allow them to perform appropriately in any environment. Part of the MSD curriculum involves training in Room Entry Tactics (RET). The first part of RET training is done using Ultimate Training Munitions (UTM) type, non-lethal training rounds that permit our agents to conduct RET but in a less strict environment than that required for live fire exercises. The second part, the more advanced training, involves RET live fire exercises. To accomplish this, special equipped facilities that permit special ammunition for "live-fire shooting" are utilized. In addition, during the RET training MSD personnel are trained in the use of breaching techniques to include ballistic and mechanical breaching.<br />The RET training supports and is a vital component in accomplishing all three MSD mission sets as agents&nbsp;will have to instruct supporting units overseas in RET and be able to employ these tactics in operational environments. MSD requires a Live Fire Flat Range with cleanup, Role Players for Force on Force training, and a Live Fire Shoot House {LFSH) capable of supporting all facets of RET to include, 5.56mm live fire, 9mm live fire, use of Diversionary Devices, ballistic breaching, mechanical breaching, center fed rooms, comer fed rooms, hallways, "X" intersections, "T" intersections, "L" intersections, stairwells, multiple entrances/exits, various room sizes/ configurations, and at least two levels with catwalks over each level. It is necessary that the LFSH rooms be re-configurable for furniture location and has on-site support staff capable of repairing breached doors on request from the instructors. Academi Training Center facilities meet and exceed these requirements.</p>
<p>4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is authority FAR 8.405 -6 (1), only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.<br /> <br />5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition require s used of the authority cited.</p>
<p>The facilities at Academi Training Center, located in Moyock, NC, allow us to train with UTMs and live&shy; fire. Their facilities can accommodate the full array of RET training requirement in one centrally located facility while allowing the Department of State to utilize Dos instructors. In addition, the variety of and the various outdoor shooting ranges gives us more flexibility in our training and allows us to train our agents to a higher level than possible at any other training facility.&nbsp;MSD is justifying the use of Academi Training Center facility as one of the only two sites that had availability and the specialized facilities that suited the MSD training mission. This training facility meets the needs of this office's training program while saving approximately $ in training facility costs.</p>
<p><br />6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, Academi Training Center is one of the closest facilities that can accommodate our MSD agent specific live-fire training requirements. Academi Training Center and Panthera Training Center (PTC) are the only two facilities that will allow the Department of State to utilize facilities (ranges, shoot houses) without hiring the company's instructors. Due to current budget constraint s and direction from OS management, our office has made every attempt to accommodate training requirements within our Bureau. While DS/T/MSD can provide its own instructors, we do not have the facilities required to accommodate the training; the Interim Training Facility has no facility for live fire. MSD is also under guidance that we can only use eleven specific approved facilities when our instructors are providing training. Of the eleven only four have at least one LFSH facility. Of the four, Mid-South Self Defense Shooting in Mississippi and O'Gara Training Facilities in Montrose, VA and Alton, VA fail to meet all the requirements in paragraph three above. Of the two remaining, PTC and Academi Training Center, it comes down to cost differences between the two.</p>
<p>7.	A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The Contracting Office has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. Academi Training Center and Linxx/PTC are the only two facilities that will allow the Department of State to utilize facilities (ranges/shoot houses) without hiring the company's instructors. Academi Training Center facilities will cost the government approximately $ and PTC will cost the government approximately $, based on pricing established under the Linxx Global Solutions Contract# SAQMMA11D0089. Using Academi Training Center will save the government approximately $ over the next available vendor while adding more flexibility to the training, as PTC only has one LFSH and Academi Training Center offers several training venues to support live -fire training.</p>
<p>8.	A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.</p>
<p>A market survey was conducted within the constraints outlined above via internet searches, telephone calls, receiving a quote from Academi Training Center and reviewing existing contract data with PTC. MSD is under guidance that we can only use eleven specific approved facilities when our instructors are doing the training, of the eleven only four have at least one LFSH facility. Of the four, Mid-South Self Defense Shooting in Mississippi and O'Gara Training Facilities in Montrose, VA and Alton, VA fail to meet all the requirements in paragraph three above. Of the two remaining, PTC and Academi Training Center, it comes down to cost differences between the two.<br /> <br />9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>As prescribed above, there are only two facilities in the region which allow this office to conduct live-fire shoot house training, utilizing our instructor cadre and subject matter experts. The deciding factor to seek a training event at Academi Training Center was first and foremost based on cost savings to the Government. Second to that is the facility itself; with multiple live-fire shoot houses, Academi Training&nbsp;Center offers a diverse and ideal facility at which to conduct our initial agent training in a very technical and critical life-safety skillset.</p>
<p>10.	A listing of sources, if any, that expressed,  in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>None</p>
<p>11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>This Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for other than full and open competition will be published on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR Section 6.305 within 14 days of award or within 30 days if the J&amp;A is for unusual and compelling urgency.</p>
