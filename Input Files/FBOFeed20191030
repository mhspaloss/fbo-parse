QUANTITY: 295 EA FIRST ARTICLE REQUIREMENT: YES DESTINATION: FOREIGN MILITARY SALES REQUIRED DELIVERY: TBD QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: YES EXPORT CONTROLLED: YES SURPLUS/OVERHAULED MATERIAL ALSO SOLICITED: NO PURCHASE HISTORY: 20 March 2019 - SPRTA119F2983 - 706 EA - UTC CAGE 52661 - Large Business In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<SOLNBR>GSFC2109ATHENA-ISOLATOR
<RESPDATE>111419
<CONTACT>Spencer W. Hurd, Contracting Officer, Phone 3012869228, Email spencer.w.hurd@nasa.gov
<DESC><div>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has the requirement to design, develop and deliver an isolator mounting system for further study and testing as a part of an international spacecraft program. To do so, GSFC intends to accomplish a sole source contract with Moog Inc. pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA) spacecraft is intended to combine a large X-ray telescope with state-of-the-art scientific instruments to address key questions in astrophysics. ATHENA was selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) as the second large mission of the "Cosmic Vision Program" during March of 2013. NASA is an international partner in this effort and has teamed with ESA, its international partners and other support contractors.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The ATHENA spacecraft consists of several critical components, one of which is the Science Instrument Module (SIM). The SIM comprises two science instruments (WFI and X-IFU), the Science Instrument Bench (SIB), and supporting hardware. The SIM is relatively large in comparison to the spacecraft (SC) and has the important role to provide primary thermo-mechanical stability when accommodating the two science instruments. Most critically, the SIM must provide a benign mechanical load environment during launch; ideally, attenuating responses significantly below the Design Limit Load (DLL) required to protect the payloads. To accomplish this task, the SIB requires an isolator system that has been proven in a launch environment and fits the design configuration developed by ESA. Additionally, an SIB Technology Development Activity (TDA) is being executed to demonstrate through an SIB Demonstration Model (DM) test the design and manufacture of the SIB primary structure and isolator system with interfaces to the rest of the SC.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>As a part of its contribution to the ATHENA mission, NASA will support the design, development and testing of an isolator for the SIB TDA. NASA is subject to an aggressive schedule, established by ESA, and intends to utilize existing isolator technology that has been proven in flight and will conform, to ESA designs for the SIM TDA. NASA will accomplish the design, manufacture and delivery of a structural isolator DM by June 2020 for further testing by the ATHENA team.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The isolator effort includes performing analyses using the established ATHENA Science Instrument Bench (SIB) and Spacecraft Fixed Metering Structure (FMS) interfaces. The interface volume has an inner radius of 1750mm; outer radius of 2050mm; and, is 110mm high. The attach points are on the 1900mm bolt circle. Using established loads based on the Ariane 5 launch vehicle and the ATHENA observatory models, analyses will define a passive isolator design that dampens SIB structural response to 16.5g axial and 4.5g lateral quasi static design limit loads during the launch phase. Additionally, the analyses shall show axial and rocking vibration mode between 28-32 Hz when coupled to the FEM through the isolator system. An isolator design review with the ATHENA team will occur before manufacturing hardware for use in the DM. Manufacturing includes isolator fabrication and delivery along with isolator Quality Assurance reports. The procurement requires installation instructions and support, as well as post test data analyses.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The CSA Engineering division of Moog Inc. has developed an isolator system that is a highly-damped flexure system designed for shock isolation of a whole spacecraft from launch vehicle induced shock loads. This system is ideal for reducing axial (thrust-direction) and lateral shock loads imparted to the spacecraft. Moog's isolators provide custom vibration isolation solutions for whole spacecraft and have been proven successful in a launch environment by use on other NASA programs. The Moog isolators are a patented technology and a qualified system that can be integrated quickly with minimum effort and do not require modifications to flight hardware. Moog has the specialized knowledge and ability to provide whole spacecraft multi-axis passive dampening systems for this specific use, with no other known qualified substitutes in the marketplace.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>GSFC intends to issue a sole source Request for Proposal to Moog Inc. for the design, development and manufacture of passive vibration isolation hardware for use on the ATHENA SIM DM. This hardware will provide vibration isolation and dampening during the spacecraft launch phase and operation in orbit. SIM DM isolation hardware delivery is needed during June of 2020, which will then be mounted and tested on the ATHENA SIM DM to validate the ATHENA Finite Element Models (FEM). It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be issued with a period of performance of December 15, 2019, thru September 30, 2020.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The submission should be in writing and to the Contracting Officer listed as the primary POC, received by 5 PM Eastern 15 days following the issuance of this synopsis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Written capabilities / qualifications received within the timeframe will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.<br /></div>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Contact Center, also known as NCI's Cancer Information Service (CIS), was established in 1975 and is a Federally funded program that is an essential part of NCI's cancer education and information efforts. The first call the Contact Center took was in early 1976. This project is for the re-competition of contract HHSN261201700010C with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Prior to the current contract, NCI's CIS Contact Center operated concurrently through 4 competitively awarded five-year contracts.
<p>The purpose of this support is to provide scientifically based, unbiased information to patients, their families and friends, physicians and other health professionals, and the general public about all aspects of cancer including: cancer research and clinical trials, cancer prevention, risk factors, symptoms, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, living with cancer, and tobacco and cessation counseling and information.</p>
<p>The NCI Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) coordinates and manages the Institute's interaction with the public (including patients, friends and family), researchers, and the media. OCPL informs the public and the media about the Institute's research activities and scientific advances. OCPL also works closely with NCI scientists and partner organizations to design and develop effective methods to reach diverse audiences and to meet their needs for the latest, evidence-based cancer information.</p>
<p>The NCI's CIS is an important component of the agency's communications enterprise and supports the NCI mission in numerous ways. The NCI Contact Center:</p>
<p>&bull; Serves as the voice of the NCI to the public<br />&bull; Supports clinical trials recruitment and NCI's clinical trials initiatives<br />&bull; Impacts health behavior by providing accurate, credible and evidence-based cancer and smoking cessation information</p>
<p>The project will require a contractor to manage the following scope of work in support of the NCI Contact Center: <br />1. Cancer information along the cancer continuum; <br />2. Clinical trials information, education, recruitment, and case management; <br />3. Smoking cessation counseling and information; <br />4. Information about NCI and its Divisions, Offices, and Centers (DOCs), programs, priorities, and activities.</p>
<p>Specific tasks to be performed by the Contractor include the following:</p>
<p>1. Create a successful customer experience designed to meet the needs and expectations of customers by meeting quality assurance standards for services access, service quality and customer satisfaction. The Contractor shall also address such topics as client effort, end-to-end customer experience with NCI products and services, and post-interaction experience and resolution.</p>
<p>2. Provide client-centric cancer and clinical trials information and other types of cancer research study information.</p>
<p>3. Provide smoking cessation information and counseling.</p>
<p>4. Develop, implement and evaluate training for NCI Contact Center staff. The Government will provide existing NCI-approved initial training modules at the start of the contract. Development of new training modules and updating of existing modules shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>5. Create and maintain trainings and other materials used to support the operations of the Contact Center (e.g., knowledge base entries, standard responses, business rules, quality tools, and other standard operating procedures).</p>
<p>6. Collaborate with NCI Divisions, Offices, and Centers (DOCs) to support NCI-directed pilot projects.</p>
<p>7. In consultation with the COR, the Contractor shall work collaboratively to review existing communications plans and develop a working document that outlines strategic outreach opportunities that advance the work of the NCI Contact Center, including engagement strategies and evaluation measures to assess progress.</p>
<p>8. Manage personnel, financial, communications, and material resources to ensure that all contract requirements are satisfied, and a high-quality, innovative service is provided to the public. The Contractor shall ensure that program objectives and quality assurance standards are clearly communicated and strictly enforced.</p>
<p>9. Collect data routinely on an ad-hoc basis using only NCI-approved data collection tools and systems and complete Electronic Contact Record Form (ECRF) for each contact at the time of the inquiry.</p>
<p>10. Provide adequate facilities for the operation of the Contact Center and the operation of contract activities. The Contractor will provide necessary office space, furniture and equipment (except where noted in the contract), workstations, resources, and supplies to carry out all activities of the contract. The NCI Contact Center will be arranged to provide a suitable working environment and to facilitate effective communication and supervision. The office layout will include area(s) for private conversations and coaching sessions, conference calls, and meetings. This also includes assuring the security of facilities used to conduct the work of the contract and the security of all Government-furnished equipment and systems.</p>
<p>11. Use systems compatible with Government Provided Information Technology (IT) and communication support. Current systems in use include Microsoft Windows 10 and all security updates, Internet Explorer 10 and all security updates, Microsoft Office 2010, complete with all security upgrades. Any future upgrades of computers and/or software shall be the Contractor's responsibility. The Contractor shall use applications, software, and databases specified by the Government.</p>
<p>12. Assure the security of facilities used to conduct the work of the contract and the security of all Government-furnished equipment and systems. The Contractor shall provide a physically secure facility for people, equipment, and documentation. All security requirements apply to the Contractor facility, alternative facility, or any subcontractor facilities</p>
<p>13. Conduct transition planning.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded with an anticipated period of performance, inclusive of options, of May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2025. The NAICS Code is 561422.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES, TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL, WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.

Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, functionality, constructability, durability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.&nbsp;</span></p>

GSA, in collaboration with its clients, stakeholders, and Design Builder intends to build a new Vertical Wind Tunnel (VWT) facility. The facility&rsquo;s design will be appropriate to the context of the site and history while responding to NASA&rsquo;s mission, organizational culture and values. In addition the design approach should balance the design of spaces for people, mission critical research equipment, and wind tunnel components.&nbsp;</span></p>

The new VWT will be optimized for operational and maintenance efficiency and provide a high quality air flow with velocities up to 200' per second, acceleration control, low flow angularity and turbulence intensity; and active temperature control.&nbsp;</span></p>

The size of the new FDRF VWT test section will accommodate the relocation of existing test rigs and associated instrumentation from the existing VST and 12-foot tunnels.&nbsp; The existing test rigs the &ldquo;Rotary Balance System (RBS) from the VST and the &ldquo;C-Strut&rdquo; from the 12-foot tunnel are referred to as Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE). Integration of existing wind tunnel model support systems including the assessment, inventory, design-to-accommodate, disassembly, re-installation and testing of the GFE and associated control systems is an integral part of the project scope and must include sufficient stiffness to accurately hold the position of test articles in the air and integration of aerodynamic measurement systems, i.e. lasers, camera systems, smoke generation equipment.&nbsp; Project phasing that minimizes down-time for the in-service GFE will be favorably considered.</span></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mike Mansfield Federal Building &amp; U.S. Courthouse, 400 N Main Street, Butte, MT 59701</strong></div>
<br />
<div>This is a presolicitation notice for the General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Rocky Mountain Region (Region 8). This is not a solicitation announcement, and there is no request for proposal or related documents. This synopsis is exclusively to publicize information about the project opportunity for design and construction services required to build out approximately 1,500 square feet of office space for the U.S. Probation Office at the Mike Mansfield Federal Building &amp; U.S. Courthouse.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Summary of Anticipated Scope</strong>:  The scope of work is anticipated to require full design and construction services to build out approximately 1,500 square feet of office space for the U.S. Probation Office (U.S.P.O.) at the Mike Mansfield Federal Building &amp; U.S. Courthouse, 400 N Main Street, Butte, MT 59701. The services require expertise in construction such as metal stud wall, gypsum wall board, paint, carpet, casework, plastic laminate counters, interior window glazing, ceiling systems, lighting, mechanical system alteration/expansion and fire and fire alarm systems alteration/expansion. The Mike Mansfield Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Contractors and A/E firms are to coordinate all work with the State Historic Preservation Office of Montana and the GSA Historic Preservation Officer. All design and construction efforts must be coordinated with interested stakeholders through regular progress meetings and consultation.</div>
<div><br />Design services require expertise in architectural and interior design, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, plumbing, industrial hygienist, and fire protection engineering. Design must include services for a site investigation, 65% design completion (mid-point), 95% design completion (pre-final), and 100% design completion (final) submittals. Based on the final design concept, the contractor must provide an updated construction work allocation plan with corresponding budget breakdown and supporting cost estimates. The contractor will also be required to perform cost estimating services to establish a baseline construction budget for the project at the time of award of the design-build contract. Before the start of the design concept phase, the contractor and GSA must agree on both contractor breakdowns of the baseline construction budget. Any changes in the budget breakdown and plan require the contractor to reconcile any significant differences submitted in a report. The report must be submitted before beginning work on the construction set of documents.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Contract Type</strong>:  The anticipated type of contract is a firm-fixed price type contract. The project delivery method is a design-build program.</div>
<div><br /><strong>NAICS</strong>:  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236200, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard for $39.5 million.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Subcontracting</strong>:  In accordance with FAR subpart 52.219-14, contractors must perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Set-Aside</strong>:  The Government intends to set aside the requirement for small business concerns based on previously performed market research.
<p><strong>Anticipated Dates for Procurement and Project</strong>:</p>
<p>Issuance of Solicitation:  11/15/2019<br />Preproposal Site Visit:  12/05/2019<br />Proposal Due:  01/06/2020<br />Contract Award:  02/03/2020<br />Start of Design Services:  02/04/2020<br />Design Completion:  05/25/2020<br />Start of Construction / Mobilization:  05/26/2020<br />Projected Substantial Completion:  09/29/2020</p>
<p>The anticipated dates are for planning purposes and may be subject to change. The anticipated period of performance is 112 calendar days for design and 127 calendar days for construction. The period of performance will be negotiable for the project.</p>
<p><strong>Site Visit Information</strong>:  Region 8 intends to hold a site visit at the Mike Mansfield Federal Building &amp; U.S. Courthouse on December 5, 2019. Interested contractors will need to coordinate in advance with the Region 8 point of contact listed in the solicitation document.</p>
<p><strong>Funds Availability</strong>:  Issuance of this presolicitation notice does not warrant that funds are presently available for award of a contract. Award of a contract shall be subject to the availability of appropriated funds, and the Government shall incur no obligation under the solicitation and notice in advance of such time as funds are made available for the contracting officer for the purpose of contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Document Availability</strong>:  The solicitation will be available for electronic download from the Contracting Opportunities domain located at the web address beta.sam.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Information on Proposal Submission</strong>:  The Government plans to conduct a competitive negotiated acquisition after exclusion of sources. The acquisition will be a total small business set-aside. The Government will use source selection procedures in FAR Part 15 to evaluate proposal packages. Specifically, the Government will use the best value continuum concept. The best value continuum concept evaluates past performance, technical factors, and price through a tradeoff process and other procedures described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make award without discussions. Therefore, offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information as the Government may evaluate and make a final decision for award solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted by offerors. Furthermore, the Government may determine acceptability of a proposal based on the initial proposal submitted by offerors. Offerors will be required to submit a technical proposal package and price proposal package.</p>
<p>The Government may establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals. The competitive range may also exclude highly rated proposals that may otherwise be included in the competitive range if it is necessary to achieve efficiency in competition among the most highly rated proposals. The Government reserves the right to establish a competitive range of one if it is clear from the initial evaluation process which proposal represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>In the Government's evaluation of proposals, the non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price. The Government intends to evaluate the following non-price factors:  past performance, relevant experience on similar projects, technical approach, and key personnel. Generally, a similar project includes aspects that are similar to the design-build scope of work for the U.S. Probation Office Renovation such as design-build project delivery, renovations and improvements in historic buildings, and renovations and improvements for the U.S. Courts. The definition of a similar project will be further defined in the solicitation document released with the RFP. The evaluation of technical approach is intended to assess the value of the offeror's design-build approach and technical solution for the project. Evaluation of key personnel is intended to assess the proposed level of experience for key positions as part of the project team. The Government may request evidence of adequate bonding capacity as a go/no-go (pass-fail) factor to ensure interested offerors have adequate bonding capacity. The evaluation criteria described in this presolicitation notice is for informational and planning purposes and may be subject to change prior to release of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Analysis of pricing for submitted proposals may utilize any reasonable techniques available to determine the price is both fair and reasonable. For instance, any of the proposed techniques in FAR subpart 15.404-1 may be used to analyze pricing. The Government reserves the right to evaluate the price realism of any selected successful offer prior to award of a contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performance and Payment Bonds:  In accordance with FAR subpart 28.102-1, performance and payment bonds will be required for this design-build effort. A bid guarantee will be required as part of the proposal.<br />Estimated Magnitude of Construction:  The Government estimates the magnitude of construction to be between $250,000 and $500,000 for design and construction services.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Solicitation Number</strong>:  The solicitation number for this requirement will not be assigned until a request for proposal / solicitation has been posted on Contracting Opportunities through the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE). The solicitation number will begin with 47PJ0020R, but the four digit serial number has not yet been assigned for the requirement. This presolicitation notice will be amended to provide information on the appropriate solicitation number once the request for proposal is posted to Contracting Opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Requests for Information</strong>:  Interested contractors are encouraged to submit any requests for information directly to the Government points of contact shown in the Contracting Opportunities notice. Please be award that the Government may not respond to requests until release of the RFP. Submitted requests may be taken into consideration by the Government in planning the project, requirements, solicitation, and contract documents.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer for this project is Dylan White (dylan.white@gsa.gov). All questions and communications should be directed through the identified contracting officer.</p>
<p><strong>Other Information</strong>:  If a solicitation is released for the need described above, then all interested firms will be required to register in the Government's System for Award Management (SAM) prior to submitting a proposal.</p>
<p>The information provided in this presolicitation notice shall not be construed as a request for proposal nor as a commitment by the Government. Information is to be provided on a voluntary basis. No reimbursement of direct or indirect costs or charges, including postage and shipping, or any other costs will be made as a result of the submission of information.</p>

At this time, the decision to set aside a solicitation to SDVOSB, VOSB or SB will be determined based on the number of capabilities statement received from prospective contractors in response to this source sought.   


This is a Sources Sought Notice and is NOT a Request for Quote (RFQ). No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Any information provided to the Government as a result of this Sources Sought Notice is voluntary. To reiterate, this is a Sources Sought Notice that is for planning and market research purposes only and is intended to identify SDVOSB, VOSB and SB that can support this requirement.

INSTRUCTIONS TO SOURCES FOR SUBMISSIONS

Interested contractors shall submit a response to Tony Clemente via email at Tony.Clemente@va.gov. Responses are due no later than 11/13/2019 2:00pm EST. Within your email please provide your capabilities statement and indicate if you can provide the required service.  Contractors (firms responding to Sources Sought) shall be able to indicate specialized experience with Philips MRI systems and have completed a minimum of 4 MRI projects within the last 4 years. The Contractor shall also provide proof that they have worked within the VAMC system.

DESCRIPTION
The Stratton VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Albany, NY is upgrading its 1.5T MRI machine. Philips Healthcare is contracted with the Stratton VAMC to provide and install a D-Stream Upgrade to the existing MRI. This upgrade will essentially replace all the MRI system s components excluding the magnet.
The Contractor would be responsible for a design/build contract to prepare the site prior to Philips  final installation, install most of the equipment Philips is furnishing for the upgrade and furnish/install additional equipment supporting the MRI system and rooms. The equipment is primarily electrical and mechanical/plumbing and includes the MRI s Liquid Cooling Cabinet, Mains Distribution Unit, System Filter Box with Covers, Patient Ventilation and its hoses, 25 kVA UPS cabinet, Battery Cabinet, FA Series Three Phase Filter, MRI Chiller, HVAC system (including 2 air handling units & condensing units) and additional equipment related to the MRI system. Please note, the RF shielding would be affected in the specified areas of work and will also need to be renovated in deficient locations.
During the Contractor s design, the Contractor shall review Philips  supporting documentation and Scope of Work to verify the existing design is sufficient and accurate. These documents would serve as the 35% design. If there are missing or misleading pieces of information in the 35% design, the Contractor shall design and/or correct the information and inform the VA COR and Philips of the required changes. Once the design has been reviewed and approved by the VA COR and Philips, all three parties shall coordinate for the start of construction.
During the Contractor s site preparation work/construction, the Stratton VAMC will send out its cases since the MRI will not be operational. It is critical for the Contractor to stay on track with the agreed upon construction schedule and Period of Performance to not only be ready for Philips  final installation but also to prevent the cost of the VAMC sending out cases from increasing. The Period of Performance will be 90 CALENDAR DAYS. 
To prevent all construction delays, RFIs, change orders, etc. due to inaccurate scope and/or existing conditions, all prospective contractors are urged and expected to conduct a full depth, on-site investigation of the existing conditions and extensively review the Scope of Work for accuracy and note all items that need to be modified or added.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Bronx VA Medical Center, is conducting a market survey for qualified firms capable of providing the following services for Bronx VAMC.
 

          Scope of Work
        The purpose of this solicitation is to provide cleaning, disinfection, and legionella test after completion to the following cooling towers:
Chiller Plant 
Towers 1&2, 3&4, 5&6, 7&8
EMD Generators Cooling Towers 1&2
All labor, supervision, and required chemistry are included in this scope.  The process will include onsite supervision by vendor of all stages of cleaning and refill to ensure the establishment of proper chemical residuals at the end of the process.
Contractor to provide before and after electronic documentation, a written report, and a cooling tower cleaning certificate.  A legionella test at the end of the process is also to be done to each tower.
Tower Cleaning Procedure:
The purpose of this section is to present the steps necessary to clean a cooling tower while preventing injuries and accidents and protecting contractor employees from hazards associated with the task.  Employees must have proper training regarding tower cleaning practices.
PHASE 1 PRE-DISINFECTION
Begin the cleaning by adding a biocide to elevate the chlorine level to OSHA standards.  Then add a biodispersant to increase the effectiveness of the biocide.  Provide protective equipment to workers who perform the disinfection to prevent their exposure to chemicals used for disinfection and aerosolized water possibly containing Legionella bacteria.  
This procedure calls for a shock treatment with 10PPM free residual chlorine 24 hours previous to the cooling tower mechanical cleaning.

PHASE 2 MECHANICAL CLEANING OF THE COOLING TOWER
The VA will assist contractor in isolation and draining each cell of the cooling tower.  Once the system is locked out, begin the actual cleaning process by using a high pressure power washer to clean the entire tower, internal and external.  This phase is done to remove as much of the micro-bio and debris as possible, without the risk of damaging equipment, and have it collect in the tower basin.  Provide protective equipment to workers who perform the mechanical cleaning. 
Inspect all water contact areas for sediment, sludge, and scale.  Using brushes and/or low pressure water hose, thoroughly clean all cooling tower water contact areas including basin, sump, fill, spray nozzles, and fittings.  Use high pressure water cleaner to thoroughly clean the drift eliminators and fan inlet screens.  Remove loose deposits from the sump and cooling tower basin.  

PHASE 3  FINAL DISINFECTION AND PASSIVATION
Fill the system with water, add chlorine to achieve free chlorine level of 10mg/L  Circulate water for one hour, open blowdown valve and flush the entire system until the water is free of turbidity. 
PHASE 4  DOCUMENTATION
Supply a CD with time stamped before and after pictures.  Supply a written report, detailing all comments and recommendations gathered from the task of cleaning the cooling towers.
Supply a certificate that attests that the cooling towers have been professionally cleaned and disinfected in accordance with the OSHA recommendations
Take and supply the results of Legionella tests for each tower cell.

<DESC>DISCLAIMER: This announcement is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for quote. This does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not quotes, and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents to this technical description is strictly voluntary.
<p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation is issuing this Sources Sought Notice as a means of conducting market research to determine if other companies are capable of manufacturing (or legitimately obtaining) the following item:</p>
<p>NSN: 1560-01-396-0310; Window Panel, Aircraft.<br />Part Number: 70207-82801-103.<br />Weapon System Designator Code: YLN.</p>
<p>This announcement is a means of market research to seek possible sources for a project and to determine if a set-aside of a type is appropriate. This is not a solicitation for work or request for competitive quotes, nor is this to be interpret as a requirement that the Government will purchase. Based on the information received in response to this synopsis, the Government may change the initial acquisition strategy. The sources sought process is not restricted to small businesses. In many cases, large businesses should also respond with capability statements, as this will provide a clearer understanding of the current market.</p>
<p>Responsible sources who consider themselves qualified to manufacture or legitimately obtain the above listed items are invited to submit a capability statement by close of business November 4, 2019 to Ashli.Procise@dla.mil. Capability statements shall be no more than three pages to include all attachments, and must include the solicitation number, name and address of the firm, commercial activity/government entity (CAGE) code, business size, and point of contact name, title, phone, and email.</p>
<p>If your company desires to be reviewed and qualified as an "Approved Source" for this item, submit an application package through the Source Approval Request (SAR) Program as outlined in the JACG SAM HB document. A SAR package contains all of the technical data needed to demonstrate that the prospective contractor can competently manufacture the product to the same level of quality, or better, than the required item. The onus is on the contractor to document and demonstrate their product is equal to, or better, than the currently approved item, which DLA Aviation is procuring.</p>
<p>If there is an open solicitation for a LSN/NSN which you want to submit a SAR, please submit the SAR directly to the buyer noted on the solicitation.</p>
<p>If you are submitting a SAR for a LSN/NSN with no open solicitation, please send it to the DLA SAR Program Office address below:</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), PMA-265 (Program Office for F/A-18 and EA-18G Aircraft), is soliciting information from industry to determine potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully retrofit the Flight Control Computer (FCC) with Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) capable software in selected United States Marine Corps F/A-18C/D aircraft. Auto-GCAS is a safety enhancement to reduce the number of Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) events.  This ECP is applicable to the United States Marine Corps only.  The Government is developing a software only solution that provides automatic pull-up capability to avoid collision with the ground without pilot intervention in a separate effort.  The software will reside in the Digital Map Computer (DMC), Amplifier Control Intercommunications (ACI), Mission Computer (MC), and Flight Control Computer (FCC).

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">NAS Lemoore treats surface water from the California Aqueduct System by conventional filtration with GAC filter beds and as described in 40 CFR &sect; 141.64(b)(2), NAS Lemoore is a system that uses [free] chlorine as both the primary and residual disinfectant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the GAC in the filter beds is to reduce Total Organic Carbon (TOC) by adsorption and biodegradation, so that the level of disinfection byproducts formed by primary disinfection at the treatment plant and residual disinfection in the distribution system will not exceed the regulatory MCL.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">NAS Lemoore has effectively reduced TOC and maintains compliance with the disinfection-by-products maximum contaminant level regulation using virgin and custom municipal reactivated Calgon Carbon Filtrasorb 300M GAC. </span></p>

Above the media, each filter has four "S" type rotary surface wash spray arms, filter wash piping, and five filter feed/wash water troughs. During GAC exchanges the last two years, we have noted that there is less sand and more GAC, such that if the extraction level is increased to the full 30", the contracted is not expected to encounter significant sand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The filters, including the GAC and sand, also are used to meet Federal and State Surface Water Treatment filtration requirements as described in 40 CFR &sect; 141 Subpart H-Filtration and Disinfection and Subpart P-Enhanced Filtration and Disinfection-Systems Serving 10,000 or More People. The filters typically operate as a conventional treatment plant with filtration following coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation, but also may be used in direct filtration mode (bypassing sedimentation) when the clarifier is offline for maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">To sustain the GAC, the contractor will replace the spent GAC in a filter with a blend of virgin and/or blend of virgin and custom segregated reactivated GAC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will remove by hydraulics approximately 30" of spent GAC from a filter, down to a level 134" below the top of the filter wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will then refill the filter bed with NSF 61 certified virgin GAC or a blend of custom segregated reactivated GAC (removed prior from NAS Lemoore's WTP) and virgin (makeup) GAC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bed shall be filled with approximately 30" of GAC to a level that is 104" below the top of the filter wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will transport the spent GAC removed from the filter to the contractor's NSF 61 certified custom segregated reactivation facility for AWWA B605 custom segregated reactivation and hold the reactivated GAC in segregated storage for future GAC exchanges.</span></p>

In regards to security screening and public safety, sensitive, accurate and reliable methods for detecting and identifying explosive threats in the field continue to be a necessity for DoD entities and other federal government agencies. One method that is commonly utilized in the field to identify bulk quantities of unknown explosive samples is Raman spectroscopy. With current sensitivity levels, Raman spectroscopy faces significant challenges when it comes to detecting and identifying explosive samples that are present in trace quantities (e.g. sub-milligrams).</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NSWC IHEODTD) is seeking (1) Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and near COTS Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) systems/modules and their dedicated SERS substrate platforms that are capable of detecting trace amounts of energetic materials, as well as (2) discrete SERS substrates. The detection of energetic materials should include, but is not limited to, commercial and military explosives (e.g. TNT, RDX, PETN) as well as Home Made Explosives (HME).</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This SSN<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </strong>solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing SERS systems and dedicated substrate platform features, capabilities, and performance. Based on the information gathered, NSWC IHEODTD plans to select SERS systems and SERS substrates to be included in a test and evaluation effort. SERS substrates that can also be adapted to currently fielded systems are highly desired, as part of this effort will focus on evaluating the ability of individual SERS substrates to be coupled with and utilized by fielded systems (e.g. Gemini, PGR, etc.). The evaluation will assess the capabilities of each SERS system and substrate.<span style="COLOR: black"> </span>Following completion of the test and evaluation effort, a final report will be written and available for use by the Department of Defense, government agencies, and law enforcement organizations.</span></p>

One technology that is routinely used in security screening with the ability to penetrate a variety of materials to detect concealed threats and contraband is transmission X-ray imaging. In regards to security screening and public safety, sensitive, accurate and reliable methods for detecting and identifying threats in the field continue to be a necessity for DoD entities, especially Joint Service EOD, and other federal government agencies.</span></p>

<RESPDATE>111519
<CONTACT>Wendell Conyers, Supervisory Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 692-4784, Email wendell.conyers@hhs.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /><br />BIOLOGICAL ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY/INFLUENZA AND EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES DIVISION (BARDA/IEIDD)<br /><br />DATE: October 30, 2019<br /><br />TITLE: Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United States to Promote National Security and Public Health<br /><br />RFI No: RFI-20-Executive-Order-on-Modernizing-Influenza-Vaccines-0001<br /><br />1.0 Description
<p>1.1 The Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division (IEIDD), in support of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), is seeking information regarding ways an interested contractor could assist the U.S. Government (USG) with modernizing influenza vaccines in the United States in accordance with the recent Executive Order (EO) issued on September 19, 2019 (EO 13887). The intent is to promote national security and public health by developing better and faster influenza vaccines that provide more effective and longer lasting protection against many or all influenza viruses. BARDA is seeking this information in order to better inform development of the strategy as required by the EO.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</p>
<p>The IEIDD is issuing this RFI solely for information and planning purposes - it does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), a promise to issue a RFP, or a commitment to issue any type of solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the USG to contract any supply or service whatsoever. At this time, IEIDD is not seeking development proposals and will not accept or review unsolicited proposals received.</p>
<p>The USG will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Submission is voluntary and is not required to propose to subsequent solicitation on this topic (if any).</p>
<p>If IEIDD chooses to release a solicitation in the future, it will be synopsized on the System for Award Management (https://www.sam.gov/SAM/) website and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness &amp; Response (ASPR) website at https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/. It is the responsibility of the potential respondee to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to any potential requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>Within the USG, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is tasked with protecting the civilian population by providing leadership in research, development, acquisition, deployment, and use of effective medical countermeasures to treat the adverse health effects resulting from intentional exposure to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents, and natural exposure(s) to pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Prevention of disease caused by seasonal and novel influenza strains of pandemic potential continues to be a public health challenge. The current domestic enterprise for manufacturing influenza vaccines has critical shortcomings. Most influenza vaccines are made in chicken eggs, using a 70-year-old process that requires months-long production timelines, limiting their utility for pandemic control; rely on a potentially vulnerable supply chain of eggs; require the use of vaccine viruses adapted for growth in eggs, which could introduce mutations of the influenza vaccine virus that may render the final product less effective; and are unsuitable for efficient and scalable continuous manufacturing platforms. It is the policy of the United States to modernize the domestic influenza vaccine enterprise to be highly responsive, flexible, scalable, and more effective at preventing the spread of influenza viruses. The Executive Order issued on September 19, 2019 directs actions to reduce the United States' reliance on egg-based influenza vaccine production; to expand domestic capacity of alternative methods that allow more agile and rapid responses to emerging influenza viruses; to advance the development of new, broadly protective vaccine candidates that provide more effective and longer lasing immunities; and to support the promotion of increased influenza vaccine immunization across recommended populations.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information<br /><br />The USG is seeking information from developers/manufacturers on approaches, estimated timelines, and costs to implement the EO in the areas described below. Respondents may address one or more of the following areas:<br /><br />1. Expand and diversify domestic vaccine-manufacturing capacity using innovative, faster, and more scalable technologies, including cell-based and recombinant vaccine manufacturing, through cost-sharing agreements. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Information on vaccines currently licensed in the United States, or that are projected to be licensed in the United States in the next 1-2 years, is particularly desired. Information on current or projected domestic manufacturing capacity, and corresponding number of seasonal doses, along with suggested approaches that could be taken, in alignment with the EO, to expand capacity is requested. Information, if available, on projected pricing, and break-even points for per dose price and total selling volume are of particular interest. Also, estimated per dose pricing and delivery capability (time to first released vaccine dose from time of sequence identification and number of doses/week) for pandemic vaccine is requested, as well as requirements for capability sustainment costs. Finally, discuss willingness, cost, and time to transfer technology to public-private partnership for production of either seasonal and/or pandemic vaccine.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Information on additional approaches that can be implemented to decrease time to release of first vaccine dose from time of sequence identification is also of interest.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; If currently using an adjuvant, or plan to use one in the future, discuss capacity, cost, impact on the number of deliverable vaccine doses, and proposed approaches to expand manufacturing capabilities/capacity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Discuss current or planned fill/finish capacity and need, if any, for increased capacity during a pandemic.<br /><br />2. Expand domestic production capacity of adjuvants in order to combine such adjuvants with both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Discuss the technology, capacity, timeline, rough order of magnitude cost, licensing of adjuvant(s) to other companies for use with influenza vaccines and transfer of manufacturing technology to other entities, such as the HHS Centers for Innovation and Advanced Development or other domestic manufacturing facilities.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Information on adjuvants licensed for other products that could be tested/used/licensed for use with influenza vaccines is of interest.<br /><br />3. Expand domestic fill-and-finish capacity to rapidly fulfill antigen and adjuvant needs for pandemic response.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Discuss approaches to expand or otherwise improve fill-finish capacity for influenza vaccines. Include information on expected costs for process validation, estimated production capacity (millions of doses per week) as well as costs and activities to sustain the capability. <br /><br />4. Proposed approaches for development and licensure of influenza vaccines utilizing alternative delivery approaches are requested. Of particular interest are approaches that are easily scalable with a small footprint and have sustainable manufacturing through utilization with other vaccines. Information on data generated with pre-pandemic influenza strains is of particular interest, as are development plans and estimated costs to license the delivery device for use with seasonal and pre-pandemic vaccine.<br /><br />5. Potential clinical trials that could be conducted with adjuvanted seasonal or pre-pandemic vaccine to improve vaccine efficacy. Of particular interest are vaccine formulations that have been previously tested for safety in clinical trials, and have an active IND. Information on stage of development, and future development plans/costs are also sought.<br /><br />6. Cost and timelines to develop influenza vaccines utilizing incentives for the development and production of vaccines by private manufacturers and public-private partnerships, including, in emergency situations, the transfer of technology to public-private partnerships - such as the HHS Centers for Innovation and Advanced Development and Manufacturing or other domestic manufacturing facilities -- in advance of a pandemic, in order to be able to ensure adequate domestic pandemic manufacturing capacity and capability.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Of particular interest is vaccines developed using manufacturing platforms capable of routinely producing final container vaccine within 12-weeks of strain identification, with protection at least comparable to currently licensed vaccines. Information on current vaccine status, development plans/timelines/estimated costs for taking the vaccine to licensure, as well as eventual cGMP m manufacturing facility requirements (for licensed vaccine) are requested. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Discuss the interest, technology, capacity, timeline, rough order of magnitude cost, and transfer of technology to other entities, such as the HHS Centers for Innovation and Advanced Development or other domestic manufacturing facilities.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice; issued for planning purposes only; and no award shall be made from this posting.
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), St. Paul District is seeking interested sources capable of providing all labor, material, and equipment necessary to construct the Fargo Moorhead Metropolitan (FMM) Area Flood Risk Management Project, Southern Embankment Reach SE-1. The FMM Area Flood Risk Management Project, Southern Embankment Reach SE-1, is located in Cass County, North Dakota, and will consist of an earth dam embankment with gravel road on top, top soiled and seeded side slopes, and ditches on both sides. Portions of the embankment slopes will have turf reinforcement mat. The dam embankment will extend from a point just south of CR16 and &frac12; mile west of CR17 in a southwesterly direction. The total length of the dam embankment is just over 3 miles. The majority of the embankment material will come from a government provided borrow site &frac12; mile north of CR16 and just west of CR17. Portions of the embankment follow the alignments of existing roads and will require reconstructing or modifying the existing road embankments. Traffic control will be required on impacted local roads during construction. A 52 foot deep slurry trench will be installed below the northern portion of the dam embankment to cut off seepage through existing sand layers in that area. The project will also include removal of existing abandoned water line and communication lines, reconstruction of farm entrances and gravel driveways, and replacement of corrugated metal pipe and concrete culverts.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this project will be solicited on or around September 2020. Once awarded, construction completion is estimated in the fall of 2022.

L.  CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE
      It is agreed that:
1.  The preliminary and final deliverables and all associated working papers, application source code, and other material deemed relevant by the VA which have been generated by the contractor in the performance of this task order are the exclusive property of the U.S. Government and shall be submitted to the CO at the conclusion of the task order.

No information shall be released by the contractor.  Any request for information relating to this task order presented to the contractor shall be submitted to the CO for response.

 Press releases, marketing material or any other printed or electronic documentation related to this project, shall not be publicized without the written approval of the CO. 

M.  Earned Value Management System

1.  An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) is required for major acquisitions for development, in accordance with OMB Circular A-11. The Government may also require an EVMS for other acquisitions, in accordance with agency policy contained in VA Directive 6061.  Contractors that are required to have their own EVMS shall follow procedures contained in the VA EVMS Application Guide. 

2.  The following paragraphs reflect EVMS requirements and may be modified as necessary for selected use.  

a. Contractor Independent Deliverables.  This contract requires the contractor to operate as a distinct entity to produce a deliverable(s).  The contractor is required to have its own compliant EVMS, per VA Directive 6061, Table B-1, and provide EVM reports to the VA. 

(1). Non-Compliant EVMS.  If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the American National Standards Institute /Electronics Industries Alliance (ANSI/EIA) Standard-748, Earned Value Management Systems, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with these EVMS standards. Offerors shall not be eliminated from consideration for contract award because they do not have an EVMS that complies with these standards. 

(2). EVMS Reports.  As a minimum, contracting officers shall require contractors to submit EVMS monthly reports for those contracts for which an EVMS applies. 

(3). Subcontractors.  EVMS requirements will be applied to subcontractors using the same rules as applied to the prime contractor.  VA will decide the flow down of the EVM requirement to subcontractors. In all cases, the prime contractor is responsible for reporting EVM data.

(4). EVMS Plan.  When an offeror is required to provide an EVMS plan as part of its proposal, the contracting officer will determine the adequacy of the proposed EVMS plan prior to contract award. 

(5). Performance Measurement Baseline.  Contractors are required to resource load schedules in order to set a performance measurement baseline.  Resources do not have to be specifically named.

(6). Program Management Reviews.  The Contractor shall conduct Program Management Review (PMR) meetings at mutually agreed upon dates and locations.  During these reviews, the contractor shall present integrated cost, schedule, and technical performance status.  Government Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads or functional managers shall include cost information in discussions of schedule status, technical performance, and risk using earned value as an integrating tool.  The following shall be addressed: Cost/schedule trends, significant cost/schedule/technical variances, projected impacts, quantified risk assessments, and corrective action plans. 

(7). Contractor Earned Value Management.  The Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466A), and Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) shall be developed, maintained, updated/status and reported on a monthly basis per deliverable requirements, respectively.  The contractor shall establish, maintain, and use in the performance of this contract, an integrated management system compliant with the Industry Guidelines for Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) ANSI/EIA-748 as determined by the Government. 

An EVMS that has been formally validated and accepted by the cognizant contracting officer is required for all (fixed price, cost, or incentive) contracts, subcontracts, and other agreements valued at or greater than $50 million in then-year dollars.  The application of these concepts shall provide for early indicators of contract cost and schedule problems.

For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million then-year dollars, the following statement applies:  The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review).  The contractor will submit an EVMS description and proof of prior certification with its bid.

(8). Integrated Baseline Review (IBR).  The contractor shall review its performance measurement baseline plan with the Government within six months of contract award or initiation of an Undefinitized Contract Action, and subsequently, when required, following major changes to the baseline.  The Government will verify during the IBR, and follow-on IBRs when required that the contractor has established and maintains a reliable performance measurement baseline.  The contractor will ensure that the baseline includes the entire contract technical scope of work consistent with contract schedule requirements, and has adequate resources assigned.  The contractor will assure the Government that effective earned value methodologies are used to accurately measure work accomplished and determine contract cost, schedule, and technical performance.  The IBR will be used to achieve a mutual understanding of the baseline plan, cost and schedule risk, and the underlying management processes used for planning and controlling the project. 

(9). Subcontract Cost/Schedule Management and Reporting.  Subcontracts exceeding $20M in then-year dollars will apply the requirements of the Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) and the Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466).  For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million, the following statement applies:  The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the Government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review).  EVMS flow down to contracts of less than $20M in then-year dollars or Firm Fixed Price contracts that exceed 12 months duration is a risk-based decision and will be as mutually agreed between the contractor and the Government. 

(10). Contract Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS).  The contractor shall develop and maintain the CWBS and CWBS dictionary.  

(11). over Target Baseline (OTB)/Restructure.  The contractor may conclude the baseline no longer represents a realistic plan in terms of budget/schedule execution.  In the event the contractor determines an OTB/Restructuring action is necessary, the contractor must obtain Government approval prior to implementing an OTB/Restructuring action.  The request should also include detailed implementation procedures as well as an implementation timeframe.  The contractor will not implement the OTB/Restructuring prior to receiving written approval from the Contracting Officer. 

(12). Award Fee Criteria.  For contracts that include an award fee, the contractor will demonstrate the use of Earned Value Management (EVM) as a tool for cost and schedule control and as a basis for communicating with the Government.  The Government will determine the eligibility for of and amount of any award fee granted. In addition to demonstrating the use of EVM award fee criteria for the contractor will include the following:

(a).  Maintain timely detail planning as far in advance as practical; 

(b).  Ensure the system provides accurate cost/schedule performance status, reliable and timely cost/schedule projections, and quantified risk assessments;  

 (c).  Provide clear and comprehensive explanations of performance problems and associated impacts, and establish and carry out effective recovery plans; 

 (d).  Control and minimize changes to the baseline particularly in the near term;  

 (e).  Ensure all subcontractor-authorized effort is detail planned into measurable objective work packages to the extent possible; 

 (f).  Provide program-level Estimate at Completion (EAC) assessments that include consideration of potential risks and cost containment plans; and   

(g).  Demonstrate responsiveness regarding management system and cost/schedule performance questions and issues/concerns raised by the Government.

Advanced registration is required. <br /><br />Industry Day attendees will be allowed to bring electronic devices or any form of personal notetaking items. Notecards for the Q&amp;A session will also be distributed upon check in, and collected during the designated Q&amp;A time in the agenda. <br /><br />Attendance at this event is not a requirement for submission of a white paper or selection for funding under AFRL BAA FA8750-19-S-7001.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: <br /></strong><br />This opportunity is to develop an engineering tool (DET) to provide integration of DoD systems (hardware or software) to create a Systems of Systems (SoS) approach to achieve mission superiority securely sharing multiple forms of information over multiple domains. The engineering tool will work with a previously developed software module "Toolchain" to achieve the desired integration results. <br /><br />The ToolChain is a development environment that provides sub system engineers the tools required to integrate a subsystem into a SoS configuration to solve specific mission requirements. The core concept is global interoperability without global consensus. The data repository that powers the ToolChain is called the Field Transform Graph (FTG). <br /><br />The toolChain was previously developed by the System of Systems (SoS) Integration Technology and experimentation (SoSITE) Program. SoSITE uses the SoS Technology Integration ToolChain for Heterogeneous Electronic Systems (STITCHES) in multiple levels and the secure transfer of files between different levels using any of the existing government secure platforms. Information on the ToolChain and FTG will be provided to the offerors. <br /><br />Performers should be proficient with the technical design, development process, integration capability, and web processing that will develop a capability of hosting requirements for the following: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Community Cloud. <br /><br />This capability planned will host the following subjects: National FTG, stackoverflow, wiki type knowledge base, software repository and training materials.<br /><br /><strong>INDUSTRY DAY GOALS:<br /><br /></strong>The goals of this Industry Day include: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Introducing the science and technology community (industry, academia, and government) to the DARPA System of Systems (SoS) Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) Program.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Describe the purpose of the DET effort vision and goals.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Review the Research and Development Opportunity based on this Industry Day.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Explaining the mechanics of a program in general and the objectives and milestones of this program in particular. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Facilitating interaction between investigators that may have capabilities to develop elements of interest and relevance to the effort.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Encouraging and promote teaming arrangements among organizations that have&nbsp;the necessary expertise, facilities and capabilities to meet research objectives established by the effort. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Provide details, methods, and suggested timelines to meet with projected funding to submit White Papers to the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number: FA8750-19-S-7001 for Timely, Secure, and Mission-Responsive Aerial Warfighting Network Capabilities.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will include brief overview presentations by government personnel as well as a working session to discuss and develop potential innovative technical approaches and respond to questions from participants.<br /><br /><strong>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DESCRIPTION:<br /></strong><br />This effort is planning to pursue, but not limited to, the following technical areas:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Research and implement a DevOps government cloud-based platform using an existing format (to be provided) as an example and be knowledgeable in and comply with existing DoD guidance to implement the platform.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Research and implement code sharing, checking, and testing using the novel toolChain workflow.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Research and implement secure cloud-based hosting in multiple levels and provide the ability for the secure transfer of files between different levels using any of the existing government secure platforms (Gov Cloud, FENCES, SIPR, JWICS, etc)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Research and implement elegant, user-friendly, interface for user-authenticated organized forums, code/file/project repository, and software distribution.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Research and upgrade capability to use the toolChain via web interface compatible with DoD standard desktops without requiring install of any software.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Research and implement on-line project management tooling such as Kanban boards or task trackers to allow any user to create, maintain, update, and visualize schedules/deliverables/personnel/milestones/assets of a project related to integration events.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Research and implement intuitive automated testing workflow a novice user can operate. Novice users are not expected to create automated testing workflow. Experienced and power users should have sufficient control to create automated tests to be intuitively executed by novice users.</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Exception to Fair Opportunity Memo

Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C245-20-AP-0172

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 05, Baltimore VA Medical Center (512)
2237: 512-20-1-098-0028
Description of Action: The proposed sole source task order against joint National Acquisition Center (NAC)/Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) contract SPE2D1 17 D 0022 is for a one-year firm-fixed price (FFP) effort for maintenance, support, and repair services for high cost/high tech medical imaging equipment at the VA Maryland Health Care System.  
Description of Supplies or Services: The proposed action is to provide maintenance, support, and repair services for an Aquilion One Genesis 640 CT at the Baltimore VA Medical Center.  The contractor will provide travel, original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-certified parts, and labor to complete scheduled preventive maintenance in accordance with the OEM written specifications as well as unscheduled repair services as-needed. The vendor must provide software and quality updates, technical and clinical application support by telephone, and remote monitoring and support to minimize unexpected equipment downtime and maximize use of the equipment. The total estimated value of the proposed action is $153,940.00 per year.  
Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505 Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i): 
(   )FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(A):  The agency need for the supplies or services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would result in unacceptable delays.
( X ) FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B): Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.
(  ) FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C):  The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.
 (  ) FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(D):  It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.
(  )  FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(E):  For orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from a specified source . The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity for this action is 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as the Veterans First Contracting Program which provides the authority to directly contract with a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or a Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB).  
(  )  FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F) In accordance with section 1331 of Public Law 111-240 (15 U.S.C. 644(r)), contracting officers may, at their discretion, set aside orders for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3). When setting aside orders for small business concerns, the specific small business program eligibility requirements identified in part 19 apply.
Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  This requirement is for the support of highly-specialized medical imaging equipment that is regulated by the FDA. The original equipment manufacturer, Canon Medical Systems, has proprietary knowledge of the equipment as well as proprietary access within the equipment software that makes them uniquely capable of supporting this equipment. Only Canon Medical Systems can provide software and quality updates for this equipment. Additionally, only Canon Medical Systems has an MOU-ISA with the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide remote monitoring and support of Canon radiological imaging equipment which allows Canon to anticipate equipment failures before they occur which minimizes equipment downtime and the need to reschedule patients. Canon is also the only vendor that can provide remote procedural assistance on the covered equipment to optimize the use of this equipment and minimize patient dosing.
If this is a Brand Name Justification:  The discussion shall include how the particular brand-name, product, or feature is essential to the Government s requirements and market research indicates other companies  similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency s needs. Include this sentence in your discussion:  
6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  
The original equipment manufacturer, Canon Medical Systems, was contacted to provide a list of authorized service providers for support of Canon Medical equipment. At this time, Canon Medical Systems does not authorize any other provider to perform software and quality updates. Additionally, market research determined that only Canon Medical Systems has an MOU-ISA with the Department of Veterans Affairs for support of Canon Medical Radiology equipment which would enable a vendor to provide remote monitoring and technical support of the covered equipment. 
 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Describe actions taken, or that will be taken, to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before initiating any subsequent acquisitions for the supplies, or services required, including challenges to restrictive data markings, data rights, preparation of a performance based work statement, and etc.  
In situations involving highly-specialized medical equipment, it is difficult to remove barriers to competition because the original equipment manufacturer has proprietary knowledge of the equipment and access within the equipment software that makes them uniquely capable of supporting this equipment. The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed. However, unless the manufacturer authorizes other service providers to maintain Canon Medical equipment, the only alternative to increase competition would be to replace the Canon Medical equipment with equipment from another manufacturer. Replacing the equipment would not be economical at this time but all FDA approved alternatives will be considered with the existing equipment reaches the end of its useful life. 
8.  Market Research: Provide a description of the market research conducted among the contract holders and the results.  If market research was not conducted, the reasons it was not conducted should be stated.  When citing 16.505(b)(2(i)(b) or 16.505(b)(2)(i)(e), the only possible way to state in paragraph 5 of the J&A that there is only one contractor who can fulfill the agency s needs is to conduct market research, and it should be summarized here. 
Due to the high-tech nature of this equipment and the proprietary nature of its software, only providers authorized by the equipment manufacturer, Canon Medical Systems, can provide software and quality updates. The original equipment manufacturer, Canon Medical Systems, was contacted to provide a list of authorized service providers for support of Canon Medical equipment. At this time, Canon does not authorize any other provider to perform software and quality updates. Additionally, a review of the National MOI-ISA repository determined that only Canon Medical Systems has an MOU-ISA with the Department of Veterans Affairs for support of Canon Medical Radiology equipment which would enable a vendor to provide remote monitoring and technical support of the covered equipment.
9.  Other Facts: This contract is part of a VA-DoD Direct Sharing Agreement, in accordance with VHA Handbook 1660.04, which is highly encouraged to improve cost effectiveness.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Problem: Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is the most widely used bioplastic today. Its biodegradability, biocompatibility, high strength, and stiffness as a commodity polymer make PLA one of the most promising bioplastics under development. Its many application areas include but are not limited to biomedical devices, biodegradable films and packages, and 3D printing. However, PLA&rsquo;s brittle nature is a major barrier to its adoption in much wider application areas. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Solution: The BEST approach dramatically improves the ductility and toughness of PLA via a novel industry-friendly soft-coupling technology based on small droplets and chain end/tail modification. This technology is realized by a scalable, environmentally friendly process that uses only nontoxic additives and a melt-phase process to achieve the desired droplet-in-polymer microstructures, referred to as polymer&ndash;droplet composite. The droplets work as a unique topological modifier to manage the topological defects of chain entanglement networks. As a result, with minimal loading of modifiers (&lt;1.5 wt%), the modified PLA offers significant improvements in toughness as well as processability without sacrificing the material&rsquo;s mechanical strength.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Impact: The production capacity of the biobased-polymer industry is projected to triple, from 3.5 million tons in 2011 to nearly 12 million tons in 2020. As the fastest-growing segment of this market, PLA is expected to account for over $6.5 billion because of its use in packaging, biomedical devices, composites, additive manufacturing, and other areas. Overcoming the issue of brittleness without sacrificing other valuable mechanical properties would revolutionize the already rapidly growing PLA industry. Improvements in mechanical performance would not only extend existing markets, but also enable new applications such as films and packages and penetration into new polymer markets. The new materials derived using the BEST approach exhibit outstanding mechanical toughness and processability, which are of great value for its broad applications.</span></p>

<DESC>The 35th Contracting Squadron at Misawa Air Base, Japan intends to award a sole source purchase order to Cherokee Nation Management &amp; Consulting, L.L.C. Required items to be purchased include:
<div><br /></div>
<div>At least 15 Advisory &amp; Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) for housing support management and project manager positions, with performance taking place at Misawa &amp; Kadena Air Bases in Japan.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Applicability of Authority:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div>This purchase will be made under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures as authorized by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). Cherokee Nation Management &amp; Consulting, L.L.C. currently holds a contract with the Department of HHS, which will be terminated on 31 Oct 2019. As such, both Misawa &amp; Kadena Air Bases will have multiple personnel terminated, resulting in a critical mission hindrance. Since this will just be a bridge contract awarded to prevent a substantial duplication of costs to the government and unacceptable delays, an enterprise contract will be awarded in the future for a longer period of performance.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy this agency requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely with the discretion of the Government.&nbsp;</div>

<SUBJECT>Optimization of Catalysts Used in Carbon Dioxide Capture After Enhanced Oil Recovery
<SOLNBR>20_003
<RESPDATE>111419
<CONTACT>Corey Hudson, Manager, R&D Science and Engineering, Phone 505-284-1392, Email cmhudso@sandia.gov - Debi Hudgens, Licensing Executive, Phone 505-284-1596, Email dhudgen@sandia.gov
<DESC><p><strong>Background Information:<br /></strong>One highly-efficient method of enhance oil recovery (EOR) requires pushing large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) through porous rock containing oil reserves; resulting in over 30%-60% increased volume of oil extraction. Although other gases could be utilized, CO2 is the most natural medium because it is miscible with oil, inexpensive and abundant from site-specific underground sources. The method works by allowing CO2 to mix with oil, lowering its viscosity, and enabling easier entry into the wellsite. However, increasing scrutiny of CO2 emissions from environmental and government agencies has raised concerns about continuing this process of EOR, without appropriate carbon capture in place to mitigate the effects of produced greenhouse gases on global climate change.</p>
<p>National Technology &amp; Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC (NTESS) has been working in the area of cost-effective CO2 capture for nearly two decades. One of its most notable developments has been MemzymeTM an ultra-thin enzymatically active liquid membrane that allows for high flux with selective separation of CO2. This technology has already been successfully partnered for further commercial development. NTESS is now focused on improving the efficacy of currently used enzymatic reduction of CO2 through addition of carbonic anhydrase (CA). CA is well-known to catalyzes conversion of CO2 and water to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. By "redesigning" CA through molecular modeling and site-specific mutations, a newer form of CA will result in higher conversion efficiency. Studies of the redesigned CA will also include: 1) determination of maximum storage times, 2) activity in the presence of contaminants, and 3) optimal industrial operating temperatures.</p>
<p>Partial funding for this work will be provided, through the Department of Energy's Technology Commercialization Fund (TCF), upon the identification and selection of a commercial partner meeting, or exceeding, the requirements listed below. NTESS may consider providing supplemental contribution of funding.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Technology Highlights:<br /></strong>&bull;Increased Efficiency of Enzymatic Reduction of CO2 in Liquid Amine Absorption<br />&bull;Reduction of Produced Green House Gases from Enhanced Oil Recovery<br />&bull;Novel "Redesigned" Carbonic Anhydrase for Use in Industrial Applications<br />&bull;Inexpensive and Easily Applied Method for Carbon Capture</p>
<p><br /><strong>Opportunity Description:<br /></strong>NTESS is seeking a partner to further develop and commercialize CA optimization and Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) are currently available.</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Norfolk District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 Million) construction project: Construction of the Battalion Complex Operations Building and Hangar Facility, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Hampton, Virginia.
<p>Project Description: The Operations Building is a 125,000 sf multi-story, secure facility that will house operational and administrative spaces including a Controlled Access Area (CAA); armory, private and open <br />offices; multi-purpose team room; conference; training; storage; personnel support spaces (kitchen/serving, medical aid station, physical therapy, locker rooms, laundry, restrooms); and uninterruptible power supply. The Hangar is a 225,000 sf multi-story, secure facility and aircraft paint shop. It will house fixed wing and rotary-wing aircraft bays; tool room; repair, Aircraft Life Saving Equipment, rotor balance, and wash shops; operational and administrative spaces including CAA; training areas; troop area; storage and support areas; and uninterruptible power supply.</p>
<p>Magnitude of construction cost: Between $100,000,000 and $250,000,000. Estimated completion date is 730 calendar days from notice to proceed.<br />a) PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br />b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organization if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:<br />c) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency I Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters, and<br />d) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement<br />Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are response to the following questions:<br />1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.<br />2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? Are these large scale construction projects I the area (over $25M, within 50 miles of Fort Eustis, VA) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for execution of the project? Please provide supporting documentation.<br />3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.<br />4. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit for a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />5. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?<br />6. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.<br />7. Please identify and additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Mr. Stephen Astwood at email: Stephen.d.astwood@usace.army.mil and a copy to Ms. Dianne Grimes, Contracting Officer at Dianne.k.grimes@usace.army.mil no later than 10:00 AM EST on November 13, 2019.</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Norfolk District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 Million) construction project: National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) Secure Operations and Admin Facility, Rivanna Station, Virginia.
<p>Project Description: Construct an 80,800 square feet Secure Operations and Administration Facility (SOAF) Addition and multilevel parking structure. Addition will extend the secure boundary of the existing Nicholson building, and include critical laboratory spaces on the first two levels, with workstations and meeting areas on the third level that are structured to accommodate mission, collaboration and training either in a secure or non-secure environment. The addition will tie into the 2nd, 3rd and 4th levels of the existing facility, and include raised access flooring, elevators and restrooms, a fire detection system, fire suppression systems, and mechanical systems that are independent but tied into the existing Nicholson building systems chiller and EMCS. A temporary SCIF boundary wall will be constructed on the connections to the existing facility to keep the existing SCIF accreditation prior to connections from the new addition. Electrical power for the addition will be provided with electrical power from an expansion of the existing building switchgear, and include redundant standby generators and a UPS system for the SCIF information technology center. The building will be designed to comply with TEMPEST standards and accommodate AT/FP requirements including design for progressive collapse. Rock excavation is included to make the addition possible using a cantilever design to reduce construction costs. Supporting facilities will include electric, water and gas distribution, sanitary and storm water drainage systems on and offsite. The parking structure will be built over existing on-grade parking to minimize the amount of additional parking that needs to be provided - 250 additional spaces will be provided on two levels. Facilities will be designed to a minimum life of 40 years in accordance with DoD's Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC 1-200-02) including energy efficiencies, building envelope and integrated building systems performance.</p>
<p>Magnitude of construction cost: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. Estimated completion date is 1200 calendar days from notice to proceed.<br />a) PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br />b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organization if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:<br />c) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency I Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters, and<br />d) Be consistent with law.</p>

<DESC>Decommissioning Methodology and Cost Evaluation for Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region Offshore and Gas Facilities

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR part 13, supplemented with additional information provided herein.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a hard-copy written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under 140E0120Q0002. 

The Bureau of Safety Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) has a requirement for decommissioning methodology and cost evaluation for Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (POCS) Region offshore and gas facilities.  In the Pacific Region, the BSEE develops decommissioning cost estimates every five (5) years for the purpose of assessing the ability of the lessees to comply with the decommissioning requirements, and where their financial strength does not meet the standards, assist in BSEE decisions for supplemental bond requirements.  Reliable decommissioning cost information is necessary to accurately determine the amount of supplemental bond to be required by BOEM from a lessee(s) to ensure compliance with decommissioning requirements, to cover the aggregate decommissioning cost of a lessee(s)¿s facilities in varying water depths. The most recent previous Technology Assessment Program (TAP) report, TAP 735, ¿Decommissioning Cost Update for  Pacific OCS Region Facilities,¿ (Volumes 1 and 2, Rev. 5 ¿ October 2016) can be reviewed at https://www.bsee.gov/research-record/tap-735-decommissioning-cost-update-pacific-ocs-region-facilities. 

The objective of this procurement is to conduct a detailed evaluation of the various decommissioning techniques and methodologies appropriate for use in the Pacific OCS Region, determine their associated costs, and produce an update to the TAP 735 report.  The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation. 

The solicitation document and incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-100.  It is the offeror¿s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with small business size representation of $16.5 million. The complete solicitation package is included as an attachment to this Notice. The attachments can be retrieved by accessing the following website and inputting the 140E0120Q0002 in the reference field:

Offerors unable to access the RFQ or attachments should submit a request to Rebecca Kruse via email at rebecca.kruse@bsee.gov and a copy of the RFQ and associated attachments will be provided electronically.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6- Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued under the authority of FAR Part 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<div><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2019-02, effective 06/05/2019.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This acquisition will be competed as Full and Open.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Biomaterials Group is developing infrared (IR) microscopy with the goal of producing a technique that allows label-free and noninvasive functional imaging of materials, cells and tissues. The IR microscope the group is developing is designed to acquire IR spectra with frequency range from 800 cm-1 to 1750 cm-1. A mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) focal plane array (FPA) detector must acquire IR images by detecting light with the wavelength range compatible with a NIST owned quantum cascade laser (QCL) system. The MCT FPA will allow NIST to develop an instrument that will serve to acquire high quality IR absorption spectra of biological materials at sufficiently rapid rates for imaging of rapidly moving cells.</p>
<p><br />The period of performance for the line item shall be in accordance with the following:</p>
<p><br /><strong>Line Item 0001:</strong> Delivery of One (1) MCT FPA Detector and Software meeting all requirements in accordance with the Specifications document, inclusive of F.O.B Destination, Shipping, and Warranty.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><strong>Delivery</strong><br />The MCT Detector must be delivered with 70 days of the date of award. The items shall be shipped F.O.B Destination to:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology <br />Building 301, Room B129<br />Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899</p>
<p><strong>FOB DESTINATION MEANS:</strong> The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</strong></p>
<p>The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest priced, technically acceptable quotation,</p>
<p>Technically acceptable means that the Contractor provides an MCT FPA Detector, meeting the requirements in the specifications document, and the requirements of the line item. If a Contractor does not indicate how its proposed detector meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine it does not.</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated to determine that the total price is consistent with the technical portion of the quotation and is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS</strong><br />All Contractors shall submit the following:</p>
<p>1.	For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Acceptability: Documentation including system requirements that confirms the contractor has demonstrated the ability to deliver the requirements of the MCT Focal Plane Array Detector, required in the specifications document. Contractor shall include a copy of the quoted system's manufacturers specifications.</p>
<p>2.	Contractors shall provide a Firm-Fixed price quotation for the MCT FPA detector, to compete the requirements of the specifications document. Pricing shall be as follows:</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 0001, Firm-Fixed Price:</strong> Delivery of the MCT FPA Detector, meeting all requirements in accordance with the specifications document, inclusive of F.O.B Destination shipping and Warranty. $__________________total firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>3.	A complete version of all required solicitation provisions (see attached provisions/clauses document - required submissions highlighted in blue).</p>

<p>It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to identify in their quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. If the contractor does not include such a statement, the submission of a quotation in response to this solicitation will be regarded as the contractor's acceptance of the Government's terms and conditions for inclusion into the resultant purchase order.</p>
<p>5.	Quoters shall provide an active DUNS# for the System for Award Management (SAM) registration. Quoters must have an active registration at www.SAM.Gov to be considered for award.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that this procurement IS NOT being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).</strong> If a contractor submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation;</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />F-16 Program Office<br />Fighter/Bomber Directorate<br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center<br />Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Ohio
<div><br />The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Fighter/Bomber Directorate (WW), F-16 Iraq Program Office (WWM) is researching the potential to combine services that provide base support to Balad Air Base (AB) in Iraq and F-16 Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) also performed at AB.  Balad AB is an active Iraqi base with air operations, pilot training, maintenance training, and transient aircraft support.  Balad AB support includes base management, mission support, air operations, medical support, base security, and hazmat management.  F-16 CLS includes all aircraft maintenance, Upgrade Training (UGT) of Iraqi maintenance personnel, supply support, operation of an automated Logistics Management System (LMS). Currently ILIAS Solutions from Brussels, Belgium is being implemented as the Iraqi LMS.  Additionally, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) support may be required.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>1.	Description</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>1.1	This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to perform all Balad AB support and operational functions, as well as perform all the F-16 CLS functions and UGT activities.  Additionally, the contractor will be required to support weekly status briefings and periodic Program Management Reviews both CONUS and OCONUS.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>1.2	The F-16 Iraq FMS Program Office, with operating location Wright-Patterson AFB transitioning to Hill AFB, is seeking a source for logistical, mission and engineering support for a sixty (60) month period (1 year Base, 4 annual yearly Options). Responders should indicate their support capabilities of an Iraqi AB with very limited or no country infrastructure.  Respondents must have major CLS aircraft platform  experience. The USG will provide all F-16 Block 52 data that has been made available to the country of Iraq to perform all associated CLS efforts and F-16 working groups.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>2. Background</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>2.1&nbsp;Historically and currently, Base Operations Support (BOS), Base Life Support (BLS) and Base Security (BS) (referenced as BBS) for Balad AB and Balad F-16 CLS have been under two separate contracts; FA8615-14-C-6020 to Sallyport Global Holdings Inc. and FA8615-19-C-6051 to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company for Balad F-16 CLS respectively. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to find out if there are potential sources that can provide a combination of the two requirements. The NAICS codes for this combined effort are as follows:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__________<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NAICS</span></div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BBS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;561210</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;F-16 CLS&nbsp; &nbsp;336413</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>3.	Sources Sought Synopsis Only</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>3.1	This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is issued solely for market research  (information and planning purposes) and it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This SSS does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. This is a sources sought only, which, as part of market research, is being issued in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>3.2	The Air Force has not determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a response as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Not responding to this SSS does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website. It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>3.3	Market research results will assist the Government in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open competition, a small business set-aside, or a sole source acquisition.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>3.4	The Air Force is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this SSS. All costs associated with responding to this SSS shall be solely at the interested parties' expense. Respondents are encouraged to include a budgetary estimate for the work involved. Contractors must be either U.S.-owned or a U.S.-owned subsidiary with valid security infrastructure and Secret Clearance to accomplish this effort.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>INSTRUCTIONS:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>1.	Below are the Requirements Description and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows interested parties to provide company capabilities.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>2.	A total of 34 F-16 aircraft will require CLS while maintaining, operating and securing an Iraqi AB.  Interested parties must submit a Contractor Capability Survey, along with a Capabilities Document of no more than ten (10) pages total and a maximum of 3 MB, which should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate the ability to meet the stated capabilities. Please include the following details:</div>
<div>(a)	Scope of similar/same experience</div>
<div>(b)	Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements, which should be clearly delineated, particularly with any proposed teaming arrangements.</div>
<div>(c)	Delineate if work was in support of a Government or commercial contract</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>3.	The contractor shall explain how they will use teaming/subcontracting while maximizing opportunities for small business participation in accordance with FAR Part 19.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>4.	Both small and large business should recommend small business utilization percentages as a percent of total contract value to be considered, if the acquisition is not set aside for small businesses. This recommendation should include supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>5.	All responses should be unclassified as it's been determined that a classified response is not applicable.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>6.	If, after reviewing these documents, there is a desire to participate in the market research, interested parties should provide documentation that supports the company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess the company's capabilities. If there is a lack of sufficient experience or capabilities in a particular area, the interested party should provide details explaining how this lack would be overcome in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.) All documentation should be provided in the form of a white paper, which is not to exceed a total of ten (10) pages in length and a maximum of 3 MB.</div>

Scope of Work for RFP W56HZV-19-R-0101 has been uploaded for industry review and comment. Please use the Microsoft Excel "Stryker MCWS Comment Matrix" to submit questions and/or comments by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on 25 October 2019 to <a>jenna.n.mcginnis.civ@mail.mil</a> and <a>antonio.c.smith13.civ@mail.mil</a>.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span><br />The purpose of this RFI is for the United States Government (USG) to determine the industry capabilities to produce and integrate a MCWS using a XM813 (30x173mm cannon) onto a Stryker DVHA1. PMO SBCT produced a MCWS on a Flat Bottom Hull, as a replacement to the Remote Weapon Station (RWS) currently on the platform in support of an Operational Needs Statement (ONS). The USG is considering the pursuit of a potential future system to be integrated fleet wide on the DVHA1 chassis. General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) is currently the prime manufacturer of the Stryker DVHA1 and a complete systems-level Technical Data Package (TDP) is not available.
<p>Any information received in response to this survey will be used by the USG to aid its current Stryker Acquisition Planning effort and a potential competitive Request for Proposal (RFP). Currently, the USG plans to obtain the prospective requirements identified within this survey from a source that has the ability or capability to meet the USG's requirements.<br /><br />***Update*** The Chief of Staff of the Army made the decision to go forward with 30mm Program of Record for Stryker. Additional information will be forthcoming in the Phase 1 Request for Quote, W56HZV-19-Q-0082.</p>

All other dates remain unchanged.



This is a Request for Quote (RFQ). The Department of Energy/Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) has a requirement to replace the current Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Energy Management System (EMS) for grid control across all WAPA regions with a Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) software solution and integration from a single vendor. The initial anticipated award will cover the purchase of software licensing, as well as, implementation and training for the integrated SCADA/EMS solutions in a single WAPA region. It is anticipated subsequent follow-on awards will be made for the remaining regions once funding is available in future fiscal years. This requirement is a continuation and result of Request for Information (RFI) # 89503419NWA000004 posted to FedConnect (https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/?doc=89503419NWA000004&agency=DOE)

The Government intends to acquire commercial software licenses and services using the provisions, clauses, and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, specifically FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items. This is a full and open requirement.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511, and the size standard is $27.5 million dollars. It is anticipated this action will result in a firm-fixed-price contract and the period of performance for the initial award and single regional implementation will be between one and two years depending on the region selected for implementation. The Government intends to award to the responsible contractor whose quote is determined to be the best value to the Government based upon technical excellence, price, and past performance.

All questions submitted by vendors along with their corresponding answers will be posted publically on FBO and FedConnect as necessary.

In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. It is highly recommended that, prior to submitting a quotation, interested parties obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and register in the System for Award Management (SAM), www.sam.gov, as these requirements are mandatory for any firm selected for a contract award.

It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov) for the release of amendments (if any), or other documents relating to this procurement. 

Questions will only be accepted via e-mail to Diana Weiss at dweiss@wapa.gov by 2:00 PM Mountain Time on 15 October 2019. Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice. No telephone requests will be honored.

All quotes are due in by 2:00 PM Mountain Time on 07 November 2019.

<DESC><p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is issuing this solicitation for the Consolidated Program Support Services (CPSS) Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)&nbsp;acquisition activity. The CPSS acquisition includes three separate Source Evaluation Boards (SEBs) for the following disciplines:</p>
<p>Program, Planning, and Control (PP&amp;C)<br />Project Coordination (PC)<br />Configuration and Data Management (CDM)</p>
<p>This posting includes the&nbsp;Final Request for Proposal (RFP) Amendment P00002&nbsp;for CPSS PP&amp;C.&nbsp;New questions or comments are conditionally permitted, provided they are limited to Amendment P00002 changes/information. Submission of questions or comments in relation to Amendment P00002 shall be submitted via email to the designated point of contact in accordance with Section L, Provision MSFC 52.205-90, <em>Designated Point of Contact.</em></p>
<p>This solicitation is for the CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition which is the follow-on competition for the existing Marshall Integrated Program Support Services (MIPSS) PP&amp;C task order and MIPSS Programmatic Subject Matter Expert (SME) task order.</p>
<p>CPSS PP&amp;C includes PP&amp;C integration, Earned Value Management (EVM), cost estimating, cost analysis, and scheduling. The PP&amp;C integration discipline includes programmatic services supporting managers and decision makers for all aspects of program performance including planning, budgeting, scheduling, cost control, EVM, full cost accounting and budgeting implementation, workforce tracking and analysis, and risk management. The EVM discipline provides support in the area of EVM processes, analyses, and assessments including the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) process per the NASA IBR Handbook, and surveillance and compliance activities per Electronic Industries Alliance EIA-748, Earned Value Management Systems, as well as training of EVM processes and tools. The Cost Estimating and Cost Analysis discipline provides support to program and projects in determining life-cycle costs (LCCs) and provides independent cost assessments of on-going projects. Within the PP&amp;C cost estimating and analysis discipline, support for resource data storage and retrieval library will be required. The Resource Data Storage and Retrieval (REDSTAR) Library is a physical and online storage location for documents containing cost, schedule, technical, and programmatic data on NASA and non-NASA projects, along with studies, cost estimates, and other documents of interest to the NASA cost estimating community. The scheduling discipline provides support in the areas of WBS and schedule development, maintenance, analysis, assessments to include schedule risk assessments, and training.</p>
<p>CPSS SME discipline provides highly qualified experienced SME support to program management including, but not limited to, mentoring, strategic program and project planning and alternatives analysis, program cost and schedule projections, project review, and special studies as requested by the Government.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C acquisition is a total small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CPSS PP&amp;C contract will provide Mission Service PP&amp;C support for MSFC and Johnson Space Center (JSC); however, it will include an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) component to provide additional PP&amp;C support service and SME support Service to MSFC and any other NASA Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical &amp; Service Support Centers, as identified in subsequent awarded task orders, and at such other locations as may be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. The CPSS PP&amp;C contract period of performance will include a one-year base period and four one-year option periods (to be exercised at the Government's discretion). The Mission Services and IDIQ portions of the contract&nbsp;are anticipated to be firm-fixed-price and the SME IDIQ effort is anticipated to be Time and Materials (T&amp;M). Performance-based deductions will apply to the contract in its entirety.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall possess an active Top Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) by the due date for receipt of proposals. Unpopulated Joint Venture (JV) offerors must have Top Secret FCLs for each member of the JV by the specified due date.

FRCSE shall be responsible for delivery of parts to the contractor and the contractor shall be responsible for return of the parts to FRCSE.  

The Government anticipates issuing a requirements award contract for the entire requirement outlined in this announcement.

A complete RFQ package will be available on or about 27 September 2019 by downloading the documents at the NECO Website as follows: http:// www.neco.navy.mil.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 332811 with a size standard of 750. The Product Service Code (PSC) is J016, Equipment related Services.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to the following questions:

1. Material is Al/Steel/ TI: How we can quote for all 3 material same? Are we supposed to put different price sheet for all 3 material?
Answer: The vendor price quote should be based upon the heat treatment process as defined in the SOW and not the specific composition of the material.

2.  Form or drawing needed: This will be needed to quote. Is it a bar, plate etc.?

Answer: The Government may include drawing in the orders, but due to the proprietary data not all drawing can be provided.  The bassis for individual orders will be on the item weight and  treatment process as defined in the SOW

3. Can you provide a sample drawing with material information? Just in case customer is looking an estimate only.
  
 
Answer:  Sample drawing will not be provided in the solicitation. The customer will not also ask for estimate; there is no reason to ask for this if there is a contract in place. If our concern is how much is left in the contract then we will base this on the weights used (limits defined by CLIN 001  and  002).

<CONTACT>DeAnna L. Mannel, Contract Specialist, Phone 916-557-6690, Email deanna.l.mannel@usace.army.mil - Melissa A. DeNigris, Contract Specialist, Phone 9165575137, Email Melissa.A.DeNigris@usace.army.mil
<DESC>This is a <strong>PREQUALIFICATION OF SOURCES</strong> announcement, issued in accordance with DFARS 236.272 and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Acquisition Instruction (UAI) 5236.272. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Respondents will be notified of the results of the Prequalification of Sources Selection.
<p><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Sacramento District is seeking to create a Prequalified Sources List (PSL) for levee improvement cutoff wall construction within the Sacramento Valley. The objective of the Prequalification of Sources process is to identify and select responding firms that demonstrate the capacity and capability to successfully support critical USACE cutoff wall construction projects and thus establish a PSL. Identifying and selecting prequalified sources will be based solely on the responding firm's ability to meet the specific criteria that assess the firm's bonding capability, capability to concurrently complete large construction projects, previous experience completing a large cutoff wall construction project, financial accounting capabilities to support potential Government fixed-price contracts, and past performance. The selection process will be objective in that responding firms either meet or fail to meet the criteria. Failure to meet any one of the criteria may result in non-selection. The criteria were designed to ensure selection of clearly qualified contractors with experience and capability relevant to the anticipated requirements, provide competition, and minimize subjectivity in the Government's assessment.</p>
<p>The PSL will be available for use while other acquisitions are underway for similar requirements. The PSL will be reviewed annually to ensure a legitimate need exists. Presently, the Government anticipates at least four contract actions over approximately the next four years. The PSL will be used as a vehicle to solicit several stand-alone "C" type construction contracts where the high-end of any single contract is not expected to exceed $100M at this time. This, however, does not preclude the Government from soliciting and awarding a contract in excess of this amount if determined to be in the Government's best interest. After the PSL is established, the Government intends to proceed by issuing solicitations using FAR Part 14 procedures (i.e., Invitation for Bid (IFB)). However, the Government reserves the right to issue solicitations using FAR Part 15 (i.e., Contracting by Negotiation (i.e., Best Value using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable up to and potentially including Trade-Off)) when determined to be in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>The SPK projects that are likely to be constructed under stand-alone contracts that will be advertised to the firms on the PSL include cutoff walls using conventional, Deep Mix Method (DMM) / Deep Soil Mixing (DSM) / Cutter Soil Mixing (CSM) / One Pass Trenching (OPT) / or Trench Cutting Re-Mixing Deep Method (TRD) methods and conventional materials including soil bentonite and/or slag cement-cement bentonite. Projects will be located within the Sacramento Valley with a particular focus on levee improvements on the Sacramento and American Rivers.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for procurements offered to firms on the Prequalified Sources list is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Construction, which has a small business size standard of $39.5M.</p>
<p><strong>Bonding Requirements:</strong> Pursuant to the Miller Act, Performance and Payment bonds shall be provided for each project awarded under the PSL. Notice to Proceed (NTP), will not be issued until after the successful bidder or offeror provides sufficient bonding to cover the work required as communicated under the project solicitation.</p>
<p>To be considered qualified for the PSL, firms must meet the following minimum requirements (additional information on required responses is detailed in the attached questionnaire including standards of acceptance):</p>
<p>The Contractor's company, subcontractor, joint venture partner (JVP), or merged company (MC) must have experience in cutoff walls used for seepage control within the last ten (10) years from this announcement. Multiple headings on any one contract must be considered as one construction project experience.</p>
<p>1. Conventional slurry supported cutoff wall construction project experience must include using long-reach excavators or clamshells and include at least two (2) soil bentonite (SB) cutoff walls and two (2) slag cement-cement-bentonite (SCCB) completed cutoff wall projects. For each of the four (4) projects the following cutoff wall standards must have been met to demonstrate sufficient capability:</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of 50 feet deep;<br />&bull; A minimum of 24-inches wide;<br />&bull; A minimum of 500 feet long;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec for SB cutoff walls;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec for SCCB cutoff walls at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements; and<br />&bull; The SCCB cutoff wall must have had a minimum unconfined compressive strength of 50 psi at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements.</p>
<p>2. Deep Mix Method (DMM) cutoff wall construction project experience must include in-situ soil mixing methods classified as: Wet Rotary Shaft (WRS), Wet Rotary End (WRE), Wet Rotary and Jet End (WJE) or Wet Vertical Panel (WVP), as described in the Federal Highway Administration manual Deep Mixing for Embankment and Foundation Support. This experience must also include completed construction of at least two (2) DMM cutoff wall projects including, but not limited to, Deep Soil Mixing (DSM) / Cutter Soil Mixing (CSM) / One Pass Trenching (OPT).</p>
<p>3. Trench Cutting Re-Mixing Deep (TRD) method cutoff walls. This experience must include setting up and operating the batch plant and delivery system to the cutoff wall location, and all associated work with constructing the cutoff wall. For each of the two (2) projects the following cutoff wall standards must have been met to demonstrate sufficient capability:</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of 75 feet deep;<br />&bull; A minimum of 24-inches wide;<br />&bull; A minimum of 500 feet long;<br />&bull; A maximum permeability of 1x10-6 cm/sec; and<br />&bull; A minimum unconfined compressive strength of 50 psi at the end of the curing time period specified in the project's contractual requirements.</p>
<p>4. Earth Embankment Construction Project Experience. The Contractor's company, subcontractor, JVP, or MC must have experience in completed construction of at least one (1) project that included placing at least 50,000 cubic yards of engineered fill for flood control levee, earth dam, or earthen embankment for water retention or conveyance, completed in the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>5. Cutoff Wall Construction Project Experience Supporting Data. Example projects provided must include documentation such as contract document excerpts, not to exceed 5 pages, for each project submitted which demonstrate cutoff wall length, width, depth, permeability, and strengths requirements, as appropriate, and laboratory and testing data for cutoff wall permeability and strengths, as appropriate. Additionally, each example project must include a point of contact that may be reached if needed to verify the data.</p>
<p>6. Cutoff Wall Construction Project Experience Submission. Prequalification will be based on the cutoff wall method submitted and approved. This could include one or both of the cutoff wall methods described.</p>
<p>7. Single bonding capability of at least $50M and aggregate bonding capability of at least $200M.</p>
<p>8. Past Performance information that demonstrates satisfactory or above ratings for the projects used to demonstrate previous experience.</p>
<p><em>Certification/statement that all responses to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire are accurate and complete by a principal of the firm.</em></p>
<p><em>An individual's experience gained through employment with previous companies may qualify as the firm's experience provided the individual was substantially involved in the construction of a cutoff wall. Such substantial involvement must be clearly documented in the Capability Statement. For individual-based experience the following additional information must be provided for each individual comprising the firm's experience:<br />&bull; Identify the specific requirement / project.<br />&bull; Identify the scope of the project.<br />&bull; Identify the individual's title and role on the project.<br />&bull; Describe the scope of the individual's labor effort on the project.<br />&bull; Describe how the individual's experience constitutes "substantial involvement."</em></p>
<p><strong>On Ramp Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to utilize an On Ramp concept, to maintain sufficient competition among the PSL by adding additional contractors to the list annually. This will be done by requesting and evaluating capabilities in a manner consistent with this original announcement. The Sacramento District will implement the following opportunity to add additional PSL holders: <br />1. An On Ramp notice will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). The notice shall identify by name, the contractors who have already been added to the list. The notice shall contain the description of the prequalification requirements.<br />2. The potential contractors shall be required to meet the same capabilities established in the original PSL notice for each factor that was established. The evaluation and admission of sources will be on the same basis as the evaluation of capabilities used for the original PSL. <br />3. The announcement of a new On Ramp notice shall be made annually. <br />4. Immediately upon on-ramping, each selected contractor is eligible to bid in response to any solicitation utilizing the specified PSL procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Process:</strong></p>
<p>1. The Government will provide all of the firms on the Prequalified Sources List notification of its intent to advertise a requirement via a Presolicitation Notice. The purpose of this notice is twofold. In addition to signaling the Government's intent to advertise a requirement, this notice will also be used for subcontracting opportunities. The notification will include a brief summary of the requirement, and a request for each firm to provide the Government with a positive or negative statement of interest in proposing on the project. <br />2. The firms will be provided a closing date by which they must respond positively or negatively to their interest in competing on the specific project. In addition to indicating an interest in the project, small businesses on the Prequalified Sources List must also provide proof of sufficient bonding capacity. If the solicitation is issued as a small business set-aside (see para. 3 below), then proof of bonding capacity will have been used to demonstrate that the small business concern can responsibly compete.<br />3. After the specified closing date for receipt of interest, the Government will consider whether the "rule of two" is met per FAR 19.502-2(b) to determine if the project must be set aside for the small businesses on the list. If the "rule of two" is<br />met, then an IFB solicitation will be issued and if proceeding as a small business set-aside, only prequalified small businesses would be eligible for a contract award.<br />4. Per FAR 36.103(a), Contracting Officers shall use sealed bid procedures for a construction contract if the conditions in 6.401(a) apply. Therefore, the Government will consider if:<br />a. Time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;<br />b. The award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;<br />c. It is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding offerors about their bids; and<br />d. There is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid.<br />5. SPK expects that these conditions will be met for most if not all contract actions contemplated for use with the PSL.
