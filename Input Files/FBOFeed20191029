<DESC>Synopsis / Notice of Proposed Sole Source: This notice is prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 5.201. The Bureau of Indian Affairs intends to solicit/ award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, to United Phosphorus, 630 Freedom Business Center, King of Prussia, PA 19406 for aquatic herbicide to be delivered  to its Fort Hall Irrigation Project located in Fort Hall, Idaho.

The NAICS is 325320 and size standard 1000 employees. A brand name restriction applies to all lines on the order because the BIA/ Fort Hall Irrigation project prefers use of EPA "non-restricted use" chemicals for human health reasons and ease of application and therefore will not consider EPA "restricted use" aquatic herbicides for this requirement, and the Teton Minor product offered by United Phosphorus contains the required formulation with Salt of Endothall that is effective on Horned pond weed. A 250-gallon sized tote is required for efficiency of application. Contractors interested in this requirement may submit a quote/ response to this request in accordance with FAR Part 12 no later than November 15, 2019 at 3 pm EST.

All interested parties are advised that no alternate sized totes will be acceptable; the 250-gallon sized tote is a firm requirement due to the government's requirement to apply the product over a large geographic area in the most efficient manner. Price shall also include pick up / disposal of totes at the end of the irrigation Season, but not later than 6 months after award. A determination by the Government not to complete this acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-CO-15569-SIEM
<RESPDATE>111819
<ARCHDATE>11292019
<CONTACT>Parya Fenton, Phone 2024828228, Email parya.fenton@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the acquisition and deployment of cyber security logging and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) hardware and software as replacement for those that are at, or near, End-of-Life (EoL) within three environments at the NATO Computer Incident Response Centre (NCIRC) located in SHAPE, Mons.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) within the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government, and 4) hold an active facility security clearance at the level of SECRET.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Introduction<br />To address an urgent obsolescence management requirement and facilitate technology refresh, the NCI Agency is seeking the acquisition and deployment of cyber security logging and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems that are at or near End-of-Life (EoL). These systems are part of the existing NATO Computer Incident Response Centre (NCIRC) which is operated centrally at SHAPE Mons.</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to ensure continuity of service and support by refreshing the existing logging and SIEM components of the NCIRC capability that are nearing EoL, and to enable transition to an enterprise logging solution.</p>
<p><br />Project Scope<br />The intent is to award a single contract. Interested and eligible companies may provide quotations for the requirement as a whole as follows:</p>
<p>a) Partial refresh and transition of the currently deployed ArcSight Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to provide continuity of service until replacement of remaining ArcSight components in a future project. Activities include:<br />Upgrading and migrating existing ArcSight Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) to new hardware; Deployment and configuration of ArcSight Management Center (ArcMC) to manage the ArcSight infrastructure; Tuning of event management as necessary; Corresponding implementation services.</p>
<p>b) Deployment and configuration of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES), including corresponding hardware.</p>
<p>c) Migration of ArcSight SIEM back-end to Splunk, including: Migrating existing ESM use-cases and integrations to Splunk. Configuring event transit and ingestion from ArcSight Loggers to Splunk.</p>
<p>The scope items above will be deployed in independent architectures for NATO Restricted, NATO Secret, and a Test/Reference environment.</p>
<p>Geographical Implementation<br />The NCIRC SIEM and central logging capability is operated centrally from SHAPE Mons. All scope items are wholly deployed and operated from SHAPE Mons.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for U.S. NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 18 November 2019</p>
<p>- NCI Agency issues RFQ (target): Early December 2019</p>
<p>- Bid Closing (target): TBD</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): April 2020</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p><br />This is a notice of intent to Sole Source synopsis as required under FAR 5.2. This procurement is being conducted using commercial item procedures pursuant to FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, specifically FAR Subpart13.106-1(b)(1)(i) Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available, allowing the Contracting Officer (CO) to solicit from one source. This Notice of Intent (NOI) is to inform industry contractors of the Government's intent to execute a Sole Source Award under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), specifically FAR Subpart 13.5 - Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items in accordance with 41 USC 1901.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, 1331Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20229, intends to negotiate and award a sole source procurement to Aware, Inc., 40 Middlesex Tpke, Bedford, MS 01730-1404. The procurement will be to provide 1,000 Aware CaptureSuite <sup>TM</sup> Software, Version 5.14 licenses and maintenance. This procurement will also provide the maintenance for 3,905 current licenses for a total of 4,905 (1000, new license maintenance and 3,905 current license maintenance) in maintenance. This contract is expected to be for a one year base period (1,000 license and 4,905 maintenance) and four (4) one year option periods (4,905 maintenance only).</p>
<p>The Government believes that only one source can satisfy the agency's requirement because although there are other small business companies capable of providing 10-print solutions/maintenance, Aware Inc. possesses unique customized capabilities to meet CBP's requirement. The amount of time and funding that it would take to re-develop, integrate, test &amp; deploy a new interface to our CBP applications, along with the impact of having to transition-in (acquire Background Investigation (BI) clearances) and train a new provider would be too significant at this time.</p>
<p>Other persons who may be interested, please submit your statement of interest and capability statement, no more than on page in length to include company name, socioeconomic category (if registered as a small business), website, brief description of your business entities capability to provide product/service by Friday, November 15, 2019. Such capabilities information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. <br /><br />All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation is available at this time and he solicitation will not be made available through the GPE. To obtain the solicitation email Lanette M. Barnes, lanette.m.barnes@cbp.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>All inquiries and documentation must be submitted by email to Lanette M. Barnes at lanette.m.barnes@cbp.dhs.gov.</p>

GENERAL SCOPE OF WORK:

A detailed list of electrical components to be replaced is attached for each residence. The contractor shall work with hatchery staff to choose the style of the new light fixtures.
a. Replace all switches, receptacles and covers inside and outside of each residence.
     i. Bring all receptacles up to code including GFCI and AFCI receptacles or circuit breakers where required.
     ii. Add additional receptacles in bedrooms where needed to meet spacing requirements.  Since the exterior walls are masonry additional receptacles needed on the inside of exterior walls can be surfaced mounted keeping the raceway runs to a minimum.
b. Replace all light fixtures with LED inside and outside of each residence.
     i. Remove all recessed fixtures and replace with 3 lamp LED fixtures and light boxes.
     ii. Replace combination fan/light/heat lamps fixtures in the bathroom with only fan/light fixtures with separate switch controls.
     iii. Replace exterior motion sensored light fixtures with in-kind or better light fixtures.
c. All cover plates for switches and receptacles shall closely match the color of the surrounding walls.
d. Replace and consolidate subpanels and main electrical panel in the basement into one central main panel of adequate size for the electrical service needed.
e. Add main disconnect shut off switch to main electrical service panel. Leave exterior disconnect switch in place if existing for redundancy.
f. Inspect wiring on ceiling fans and replace as needed. Ceiling fans appear to be new and do not need to be replaced, however all wiring should be inspected. Living room fans are controlled only by a remote and have no installed switch to control operation. Add a wall switch for on/off operation control.
g. Inspect the wiring to attic vent fans. Replace if necessary.
h. Design and install a current code compliant fire alarm system that will replace all smoke alarms and interconnect wiring between sensors.  Add new smoke alarms in living rooms/bedrooms/hallway/stairway/basement and new heat alarm 194F in the attic and garage if feasible.  Carbon Monoxide Sensors shall be installed where required if wood burning stoves or gas appliances are present.  A combination strobe/horn alarm meeting ADA/ABA requirements shall be installed in one bedroom of each house and common areas.  System shall be designed, installed and tested by persons qualified in the state of Idaho.  
i. Replace all wiring that is worn, damaged or out of code.
j. The wiring in the carports can be concealed by installing any exposed wiring in code compliant raceways or covering the underside of the rafters with a weatherproof panel board material.  The panel board material and colors shall be approved by the FWS before installation.
k. Inspect the wiring in the basement and rewire where needed. Install switches to control basement lighting in lieu of individual pull cords and install LED fixtures.
l. Wiring to unused appliances such as basement furnaces shall be disconnected and removed.
m. Inspect all other accessible wiring and rewire where needed.
n. Patch and repaint damaged and disturbed surfaces to as close to original condition as practical.
o. Include all demo and disposal of old materials and construction debris in bid.
p. Option Item: Install weatherproof duplex GFCI receptacles outside near the front door and rear door of the residence.
q. Option Item: Install a weatherproof combination horn/strobe annunciator on the exterior of the residence.

<DESC>USDA Forest Service National Forests in North Carolina, Tusquitee Ranger District has a requirement for Shuler Creek Stream Restoration.&nbsp; Within this ~1000 feet stream reach of Shuler Creek work is proposed to stabilize erosion and sources of sedimentation and improve aquatic habitat diversity. Work includes demolition and disposal of a log-crib fish barrier. This will be accomplished using natural channel design techniques including the construction of 24 instream structures, per&nbsp;Specifications. The channel's natural dimension, pattern, and profile (within a confined valley bottom) would be reestablished in the constructed reach using upstream reference reach data to establish a stable stream channel with high quality aquatic habitat.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to award a contract on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company. The contemplated contract will provide five years of engineering anomaly support to the existing Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) NOP spacecraft bus. Specifically, the contractor shall work with NOAA and NASA to maintain GOES NOP operations through spacecraft decommissioning and deorbit activities. The contractor shall perform the following tasks:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>1)</strong> Investigating on-orbit anomalies that affect spacecraft performance parameters and/or anomalies that threaten spacecraft health and safety.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>2)</strong> Investigating changes to the GOES mission as directed by the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Representative.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>3)</strong> Maintaining capability to read and extract engineering data from GOES NOP archive files in Decommutated Mnemonics File (DMF) format.&nbsp;
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>4)</strong> Participating in as needed technical interchange meetings&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>5)</strong> Providing written reports for anomaly investigations. These reports shall include root cause investigation, analysis, justification, and recommended operations procedure (ROP) updates.<br />

This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC><strong>911 Fed Bldg Electrical Upgrade Design Build<br />Sources Sought &amp; Request for Qualifications/Presolicitation</strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought &amp; Request for Qualifications/Presolicitation is to determine availability and capability of qualified Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Woman Owned Small Businesses and HUBZone small businesses.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice will be used for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.</p>
<p>This procurement will be advertised under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 238210 - Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors. The small business size standard for NAICS code 238210 is $16.50M in average annual receipts.</p>
<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>The 911 Federal Building, 911 NE 11th, Portland, Oregon was constructed in 1953 by the Lloyd Corporation and leased by the GSA until 1959 when the government purchased the building. The 8-story Federal Building is adjacent to and shares common areas with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Building. The electrical switchgear and distribution system are from the original construction and are outdated and non compliant with current codes and standards. The scope of the project includes: replacing all switchgear, switchboards, and panel boards throughout the building; replacing the motor control centers; replacing the emergency generator; and installing a new lightning protection system.</p>
<p><strong>Tenants:</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Congress - House of Representatives and Senate <br />Department of Interior- Bureau of Indian Affairs<br />Office of the Special Trustee for American Bureau of Reclamation <br />Fish and Wildlife Service<br />Department of Labor - Health Safety and Health Administration <br />General Services Administration - Public Buildings Service<br />Department of Homeland Security - U.S. Coast Guard<br />Department of Energy - Bonneville Power Administration (although BPA is housed in the neighboring building, 905, they share a common linking space with 911.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Project:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Replacement of all switchgear, switchboards, and panel boards throughout building:</strong> The electrical switchgear, switchboards, and panel boards are beyond their useful life and should be replaced.  The electrical distribution equipment is located in dedicated electrical rooms or closets.  The medium-voltage switchgear and utility metering is located in a locked PP&amp;L vault accessible from the basement level.  The main distribution panel consists of a unit substation located in a centrally-located electrical room in the basement</p>
<p><strong>Replacement of motor control centers (MCC):</strong> The MCCs in the basement are at the end of their useful life and should be replaced.  The MCCs in the mechanical mezzanine and penthouse are newer, but still approaching the end of their useful life.  Space for the replacement MCCs will need to be determined since replacing an entire MCC in the same location is not practical in a single weekend closure.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement of emergency generator system: </strong>The existing system is approaching the end of its useful life and should be replaced.  The existing generator is a 150kW unit.  GSA recommends replacing with a 250kW unit to provide additional capacity for multiple elevator operation and emergency loads.</p>
<p><strong>Installation of a new lightning protection system:</strong> Previous risk analysis has determined lightning protection is warranted for this building.  This system will consist of new air terminals installed on the building roof, connected together with copper wire.  Down conductors from the roof will be installed to a counterpoise system of buried conductors and ground rods located in planters around the building perimeter or in the sub-basement.</p>
<p><strong>Magnitude of Construction:</strong> Between $5.0M and $7.5M</p>
<p><strong>Project Description &amp; Approach:</strong></p>
<p>GSA envisions a highly collaborative design build delivery approach for this project where the DB contractor works closely with all stakeholders to deliver a project that meets the expectations and needs of both the team members and GSA's requirements to deliver an economical and operationally efficient high performing building.</p>
<p>As required by law, the facility must meet federal energy goals. The project is also to include conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings) and all other applicable building codes and standards.</p>
<p>The DB team will be selected through a best value / trade-off selection process. During the development period from initial concept to final design the DB team will work in close consultation with GSA, the stakeholders to ensure all of the goals are addressed and that best value practices are utilized.</p>
<p><strong>Unique Situations/Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The need for continuous operation during construction, present unique challenges for the design/build teams on the project. Facility will remain fully occupied and operational during the entire project. No adverse impact on tenant mission will be acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Occupied Facility Construction:</strong></p>
<p>This project scope at the must occur within an occupied, fully functional facility. These functions include typical office work, but also include services for the general public. This presents several challenges that will have to be addressed by the designer and/or design/build team.</p>
<p>All work in public spaces will need to be completed during unoccupied periods. Setup, construction, and clean-up will need to occur on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Responses:</strong></p>
<p>Interested small business vendors in the categories listed above shall submit their capability statement electronically, limited to 10 double sided pages. The capability statement shall be in sufficient detail to allow Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. The statement shall include:</p>
<p>1) Company name, CAGE code, DUNS number, active SAM registration printout (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.sam.gov</span>), size/number of employees<br />2) A statement describing the company's interest in performing the work.<br />3) Organization chart to include both the design &amp; construction team and relevant subcontractors.<br />4) Capabilities and experience with federal projects in design and construction of major electrical projects involving both medium and low voltage systems as detailed above. Submitted references should highlight recent and relevant design-build projects <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in fully occupied facilities</span></strong> within the past five (5) years. <br />5) Statement of capability to bond.<br />6) Contact information, phone number, email address and web address (if available).</p>
<p><strong>Responses should be emailed not later than the date specified in this to: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">richard.risso@gsa.gov</span></strong></p>
<p>Each response will be reviewed by the GSA Contracting Officer for the purpose of determining whether there exists a reasonable expectation of obtaining a sufficient number of offers from qualified and responsible small business concerns. All information furnished to the Government in response to this notice will be used for review purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>All interested parties are required to respond to this announcement via email not later than 4:00 pm (PST), Friday, 15 November 2019.</strong></p>

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and technical space in a building under lease in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or to determine what is in the best interest of the Government. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC><strong>Type of Notice: </strong>
<p>This is a Small Businesses Sources Sought notice (SS).  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business;  HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />The NAICS code for this project is 541690. The small business size standard is $15M.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics Branch (DCEG), has a need to access anonymized genomic data linked to longitudinal clinical data from clinical programs that have created platforms for genomic discovery, drug development and clinical genomic implementation.</p>
<p>The traditional approach to evaluating a phenotype is subject to ascertainment bias towards the most highly-penetrant clinical manifestations. The availability of large-scale, population-based exome-sequenced cohorts linked to the electronic health record (EHR) will substantially change the traditional, rare-disease clinical genetics paradigm. The new model inverts the traditional "phenotype-first" strategy into a "genotype-first" strategy in which we start with a sequenced rare variant, characterize the variant distribution in a population embedded within an EHR resource, and then determine its associated phenotype in an individual. This "public health genomics" approach has the potential to reduce ascertainment bias, identify the complete phenotypic spectrum, provide a more comprehensive gauge of phenotype severity, and permit more precise gene/variant penetrance and risk estimates. This Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of NCI.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this acquisition is to acquire highly specific and detailed EHR data with matching exome sequence data that will allow the investigation of the genotype-first approach in a comprehensive way using numerous cancer-associated genes studied by DCEG investigators in established, funded protocols. Specifically, the scientific needs of this acquisition include EHR on a minimum of 25,000 individuals with matched exome sequence data that will allow:</p>
<p>1)	Quantification of pathogenic germline variant prevalence and the spectrum of different variants;<br />2)	Refinement of estimates of phenotype (especially cancer and cancer precursors) penetrance in carriers of pathogenic germline variation in genes of interest;<br />3)	Detailed characterization of cancer phenotype (histology, location, natural history) associated with germline variants evaluated in 1 and 2;<br />4)	Quantification of gene-specific cancer risk in individuals with and without family history;<br />5)	Development of eligible gene- and disease-specific patient referrals for actively recruiting DCEG protocols.</p>
<p>NCI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small businesses concerns in performing the tasks/duties herein.  Based on the responses received from this SBSS notice, the proposed project may be solicited as a Small Business Set-Aside.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>A copy of the draft Statement of Work (SOW) pertaining to this requirement, which is subject to revisions, is attached to this notice.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of options, for this proposed acquisition is November 2020 - November 2025.  Multiple awards may be made from a single solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought:</strong></p>
<p>Small businesses possessing experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the aforementioned requirements and level of effort are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform the required services.  Information furnished must not exceed 20 pages (12-point font minimum), including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.; and should include an outline of previous or similar projects performed.  All responses must include an indication of current certified small business status, and clearly marked on the first page of the capability statement, as well as the eligible small business concern's name, point of contact, address, and DUNS number.</p>
<p><strong>Information Submission Instructions:</strong></p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this  Small Business Sources Sought notice must be sent electronically (via email) to Lisa Bielen, Contracting Officer at lisa.bielen@nih.gov and Jill Johnson, Contracting Officer at jill.johnson2@nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) by November 12, 2019; 2:00PM Eastern.   All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered. Capability Statements received after that date and time will not be considered.</p>

<DESC>1.0 BACKGROUND<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL) is seeking information on commercially available Messaging Applications for First Responders to meet the needs of emergency responders and protective services. In general, NUSTL is seeking information on: Messaging Applications that can be used for emergency response by first responders. The messaging applications should contain the following features and functions:<br /><br />1. Has both a mobile and desktop-based user interface.<br />2. Allows for desktop users to push Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Geographic Information System (GIS) information to mobile users within the messaging app. For example, sending a field officer a layer-based map with highlighted threats and resources.<br />3. The mobile version should have the ability for the end user to toggle on and off location sharing with multiple members of their team.<br />3.1. An administrator user should be able to remotely toggle on/off the location sharing of their team members, overriding the field operator's location sharing preferences if necessary.<br />4. Must be compatible with iPhones and iOS<br />5. Mobile application must have push notifications (similar to notifications received from SMS text applications on most smart phones).<br />6. Secure communications (encryption) that allows for logging such that audit reviews and FOIA request compliance can occur.<br />7. The messaging app should conserve battery to the maximum extent possible.<br /><br />This information is being sought for the DHS Science and Technology Directorate's System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program to assist emergency responders making procurement decisions. The SAVER Program conducts objective assessments and validations on commercially available equipment and systems and develops knowledge products that provide relevant equipment information to the emergency responder community. Information provided by the SAVER Program will be shared nationally with the responder community, providing a life- and cost-saving asset to DHS, as well as to Federal, state, and local responders. For more information on the SAVER program, visit the SAVER website at <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/saver">https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/saver</a>.<br /><br />2.0 SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTATION<br /><br />Respondents are required to complete a written Product Summary Questionnaire for each product. The questionnaire may be obtained via e-mail from the technical point of contact, Bhargav Patel, at <a href="mailto:bhargav.patel@hq.dhs.gov">bhargav.patel@hq.dhs.gov</a>. The Product Summary Questionnaire includes questions seeking the following specific information:<br />1. Company name<br />2. Company address<br />3. Point(s) of contact (name, title, e-mail, and phone number)<br />4. Business type (manufacturer or distributor)<br />5. Product name, type, description, and specifications<br />6. Cost information (purchase price and General Services Administration [GSA] schedule information).<br />7. Does the software have both a mobile and desktop-based user interface ?<br />8. Does the desktop user interface allow for ESRI or other GIS affiliated file types to be sent to mobile users of the messaging application?<br />9. Can mobile users of the application turn on and off their location sharing settings through the application?<br />10. Can an admin user of a group turn on and off the location sharing settings of other users?

Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.<br />NOTICE: The following information is provided for situational awareness and is not required to respond to this Sources Sought.<br />All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management, which indicates "All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)." Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.SAM.gov. Refer to www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.<br />Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected. <br />ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration. <br />Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM.<br />Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM.<br />To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).</p>

<DESC><p align="left"><strong>TITLE: F3T2MX9301AQ01, Sole Source Acquisition for the purchase of Datawatch Monarch Licenses </strong></p>
<p>
<p>The 4th Contracting Squadron, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC intends to award a sole source purchase order to Datawatch, required items to be purchased are:</p>
<p>This procurement will be for the purchase of one license with one year of maintenance for the Maintenance Management Analysis (MMA) Section for the continued use of the Datawatch Monarch software at Seymour Johnson AFB, NC.</p>
<strong>
<p>APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures as authorized by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Datawatch is the exclusive distributor of this third-party software. This is the only company able to provide licenses and training on this software package. The purchase of the software training is necessary for MMA to provide key maintenance indicators across the 4 FW and process data requests. Without the Datawatch Monarch software, the 4th MXG MMA will not be able to process thousands of Integrated Maintenance Data System data points effectively. This will result in a great increase of man hours and increased time needed to process local and ACC data requests. The purchase of this software will enable SJAFB to utilize full analytical tools and enable the MMA Section to provide quick turnaround on requests and enable all daily, weekly, and monthly MMA functions.</p>
<p>Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is <strong>31 Oct 2019 at 1:00 P.M EST</strong>. The anticipated award date is unknown<strong>. </strong>For information regarding this purchase, please contact SrA Joel Campbell at: joel.campbell.3@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>Technical Support and Operational Analysis (TSOA) 20-2 RFI<br />A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to gain information leading to Government/Industry collaboration at TSOA 20-2 to accelerate the development of technologies that will enable the Warfighter to be more effective, efficient and lethal.<br /><br />The Technical Support and Operational Analysis (TSOA) invites industry, academia, individuals, and laboratories to submit technology white papers addressing innovative technologies and capabilities that can be used in challenging environments:<br /><br />Physical (Terrain -Natural &amp; Urban) <br />Electronic (Frequency Congestion &amp; Overload) <br />Contested (Electronic Interference, Cyber Attacks, &amp; CBRNE)<br />Low Visibility (Tactical Effects without the Overt Tactical Signature)<br /><br />TSOA 20-2 vulnerability analysis event is executed to improve operational security, force protection and survivability. The TSOA team identifies potential vulnerabilities in emerging technologies including performance degradation in contested environments, interoperability, adaptability and training/ease of use through live experiment venues. The TSOA 20-2 experiment will focus on challenges presented by an assessment of infrastructure vulnerabilities conducted at multiple echelons, including small unit incursions.<br /><br />After reviewing the technology submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to participate in a TSOA field experiment/assessment venue in which we evaluate the capability as applied to the Warfighter, its technical limitations and vulnerabilities through an enemy perspective.<br /><br />These assessments will provide the submitter an opportunity to interact with the Warfighter, the DoD Science and Technology community, academia, Combatant Commands (COCOMS), Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) and other federal agencies for the purpose of assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on missions and capabilities.<br /><br />Submissions and Verification of Submission will be made through Vulcan.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE<br /><br />(1) Background: The Army's C5ISR Center Unique Mission Cell (UMC) conducts field experiments/assessments to support the vulnerability identification and system limitation in contested environments for emerging capabilities in an operationally relevant venue. These assessments are conducted with representatives from Government Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, academia, and industry. TSOA events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel and determine how their efforts might support military capability gaps and high priority mission deficiencies. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between academia, Government, and industry and supports identification, assessment, and dissemination of emerging and mature technology information and the acceleration of delivering capabilities to the Warfighters and those they support. The assessment results are reported back to the program director.<br /><br />(2) Assessment Focus and Submission Timeline: TSOA 20-2 assessment will be conducted: 6-10 April 2020 at Joint Base Lewis McChord, WA. <br /><br />TSOA 20-2 Focus: Protection of critical infrastructure from small unit peer/near peer threats. <br /><br />a. Detection and protection from small / advanced (highly covert and adaptable) units<br />b. Detect and Counter cyber threats<br />c. Detect and Counter Unmanned Aerial System Threats<br />d. Conduct electromagnetic spectrum defense</p>
<p>Location: Training areas include urban environment with SUB-T as well as both open and wooded terrain adjacent to the urban area.<br /><br />RFI Submission Deadline: 13 December 2019 - All respondents to the submission will be notified by the Government: NLT 17Jan 2020 <br /><br />Focus Details: The TSOA 20-2 experiment will evaluate challenges presented by an assessment of infrastructure vulnerabilities conducted at multiple echelons, including small unit incursions. Technologies that increase awareness of video surveillance, counter or disrupt surveillance, and can assess and counter the internet of things as it pertains to increased risks to operational security, force protection and physical security will be the focus of this activity. Ultimately, these technologies will provide the SM with an additional set of tools to assist in planning, execution and overall mission risk reduction. <br /><br />(3) Field Experiment/Assessment Focus: The following technical areas are of particular interest:<br /><br />TSOA focus areas (considered after primary focus technologies selected)<br /><br />a. Increase Force Protection (Soldier/Vehicle/Base)<br />b. Timely Mission Command and Tactical Intelligence<br />c. Reduce Warfighter Overburden<br />d.

<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 22.503) Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of PLAs in connection with large-scale construction projects;</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will-</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with the law.</p>

Any interested party (contractors, project owners, contractor associations, labor unions, construction management firms, etc.) may respond. LETTERS SIMPLY INDICATING SUPPORT FOR OR OPPOSITION TO LABOR UNIONS AND/OR PLAs DO NOT OFFER ANY USEFUL INFORMATION AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions:<br /><br />(1) What market share does union labor have in the Fairbanks geographical area?<br />(2) Are any Collective Bargaining Agreements expected to expire between October 2020 and October 2021? If so, please provide CBA number.<br />(3) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings on the CHL023 Moose Creek Dam Modification project? How?<br />(4) Could a PLA minimize risk to the Government on the CHL023 project? How?<br />(5) Are there ways a PLA would increase costs on the CHL023 project? How?<br />(6) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor in the Fairbanks labor market?<br />(7) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(8) Have PLAs been used on private sector construction projects in the Fairbanks geographical area? If so, please provide the following details:</p>
<p>A. Project Name and Location<br />B. Project Description<br />C. Project Cost<br />D. Was the project completed on time?<br />E. Number of craft trades present on the project?<br />F.

<DESC>USACE Jacksonville District intends to award a contract to implement additional features identified for the Rio de le Plata Project. These additional features consist of (1) the addition of riprap keys and (2) additional riprap armament of the channel upstream and downstream of the Dorado Bridge at the Rio De La Plata - Flood Control Project, Dorado Bridge Channel Widening and Scour Protection (CWSP), Dorado Bridge, in Puerto Rico. Negotiations to be conducted solely with Construcciones Jose Carro SE, under the statutory authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition, 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<div><br />&nbsp;Construcciones Jose Carro is the current contractor performing construction work under Contract No. W912EP17C0050 for Rio de La Plata - Flood Control Project, Dorado Bridge, Channel Widening and Scour Protection (CWSP), Dorado, PR. The additional features were not included in the original design    and referenced contract and will therefore be funded under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) (BBA) using Supplemental funds. The proposed features would be constructed by Construcciones Jose Carro under a separate construction contract beyond the original design, which was funded using regular appropriated, cost shared funds. This will allow Jacksonville District to adhere to fiscal law which requires additional work above and beyond what was included in the original design using regular appropriated funds be fiscally tracked separate when using BBA18 Supplemental funds. Fiscal law prohibits mixing regular appropriated funds and supplemental funds under one contract.  Most importantly, by having the current contractor perform the channel armament which includes, stone keys at the bottom of the channel slopes and stone protection in the bottom of the channel, the stone would be placed in the dry while the contractor excavates the channel in phases. Also, if the additional channel armament is not aligned to be constructed with the current construction contract then: (1) much of the riprap placed along the channel slopes in the CWSP Contract will have to be removed to place the stone key, thereby reinstalled, (2) all the excavation and stone placement will have to be performed under approximately 20 feet of water with the use of divers, and (3) the underwater placement of stone requires that the riprap thickness and excavation be increased by one and a half times to compensate for the difficult nature of underwater placement. The increase in excavation and stone key would also pertain to the placement of the already placed stone in Contract CWSP that will have to be removed to construct the stone key.</div>

NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE / SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
Â 
On behalf of the South Texas Veterans Healthcare System (STVHCS), 7400 Merton Minter Blvd. San Antonio, TX 78229; Network Contracting Office (NCO) 17 intends to award a firm-fixed price delivery task order against GENOMIC HEALTH INC task order number V797D70053 for procurement of the following Oncotype DX test: 

Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, CPT 81519
Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay, PLA 0047U 
Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, DCIS CPT PLA 0045U

The anticipated statutory authority permitting limiting the source for the requirement is FAR 8.405 6(a)(1)(i)(B) - Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.

STVHCS requires a vendor to perform the following special cancer tests: Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, the Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay and the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay DCIS, which are trademarked tests by Genomic Health.  The required testing will analyze the activity of a group of genes that can affect how a cancer is likely to behave and respond to treatment.  Testing results need to show how complex genes are expressed in cells (what their level of activity is), and the role they play in specific cancers including breast, colon, and prostate. The acquisition is anticipated to take place on or about November 6, 2019.  The period of performance will be for a base year and 2 option years.

The intended procurement will be classified under North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) 621511 with a small business size standard of $35 Million. This notice of intent is not a request for offers. However, all responsible sources may submit a capabilities statement that proves by the preponderance of the evidence that another contractor can provide an equivalent or higher performance to the Oncotype DX test.  Equivalent tests must show clinical evidence and at least three years on the market in labs (outside of research purposes).  The STVHCS requires testing that has been reliable for years and will not risk experimenting with newer specialized cancer tests unless evidence guarantees greater benefits to Veterans.  
All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Ross Futch via email at ross.futch@va.gov. Capability statements are due not later than 4:00 PM Central Standard Time on Friday 1 November 2019.  No phone calls will be accepted.

Notice: The POC for this notice does not have a Federal Business Opportunities registration account. The POC does not have any visibility to the  Interested Vendors List  tab within the FBO notice. Interested firms must respond directly to the POC email address listed in this notice.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Needle, Chest Decompression. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO DHA is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Needle, Chest Decompression products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Needle, Chest Decompression in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Needle, Chest Decompression will be established approximately 13 February&nbsp;2020 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately 13 March 2020, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Needle, Chest Decompression. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Needle, Chest Decompression.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Needle, Chest Decompression. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,396,133. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. One (1) item is required for addition to the QSL and accounts for 100% ($1,396,133) of the total volume in sales ($1,396,133). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample. Vendor must send the same part number(s) for evaluation(s) as provided in response to this QSL FBO announcement and as noted in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> / <br />5.1 NEEDLE, CHEST DECOMPRESSION, 14 Ga, 3.25 IN LENGTH, WITH CATHETER 147,764 /<br /><br />6.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin by DoDAAC" and "Issue by DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer.</p>
<p>Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico (replaces RapidGate). Vendor is responsible to acquire DBIDS credentials prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility.

EVALUATION OF QUOTES:

In accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3), the government will evaluate information based on the Comparative Evaluation process, by comparing one quotation with another in a uniform and fair manner to determine which quote provides the government what it needs, where and when as identified herein. Once one quote is determined acceptable, that quote will then be compared side by side to the remaining quotes; the  best  quote will then be chosen. Award shall be made to the vendor whose quotation offers the best value to the government, considering technical acceptability, past performance, and price.

QUOTE FORMAT AND SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:

Offerors shall provide only one quote.  Quote should be emailed to corey.malik@va.gov NLT 11/15/2019 at 5:00 PM CST. Non-compliance with this requirement may result in disqualification of the quote.

All vendors must be registered and complete all entries in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be considered for award. Potential vendors may register at the following web site: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM

All Quote submissions must list your DUNS number, CAGE code, and Federal TIN with Company name, POC, and phone number. If you need to obtain or renew a DUNS number or CAGE code, please visit www.sam.gov.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

The government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract as a result of this RFQ that will include the terms and conditions set forth herein. To facilitate the award process, ALL quotes shall include a statement regarding the terms and conditions herein as follows:
"The terms and conditions in the RFQ are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."
OR
"The terms and conditions in the RFQ are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:"
Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s).
Offerors must complete annual representations and certifications electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) website located at https://www.sam.gov/portal in accordance with FAR 52.212-3,  Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items.  If paragraph (j) of the provision is applicable, a written submission is required.


The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but not for more than a total of six months during the life of the contract.  The evaluation will therefore use the cost of the last option years pricing to evaluate cost.  Any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised.

<DESC>1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the<br />document as a "Sole Source Justification."<br />This is a sole source justification. Contracting activity is the Naval Sea Systems Command,<br />Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue,<br />Panama City, FL 32407-7001 (Contracts Department Code 02).<br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />This action will award a firm fixed price purchase order to North Atlantic Industries, 110 Wilbur<br />Place, Bohemia, NY 11716-2416, for the acquisition of commercially available synchro modules<br />and synchro connectors.<br />3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the<br />estimated value).<br />The following commercial items are being acquired:<br />Item Part Number Quantity<br />SIU31 = 1x3U cPCI slot, SIU31-28553 16 each<br />3 Functions Configured With:<br />Slot 1 = 75ARM1-2-SC1SD5SD52140WH210<br />3U cPCI ARM<br />PS Slot = 75PS4-D100WH1 Power Supply Unit, 3U<br />SIU31 Mating Connector KIT - SIU31-CONN-KIT 16 each<br />For development use only.<br />The Government's minimum needs have been verified by the certifying technical and<br />requirements personnel. This memo does not authorize acquisition for other requirements. This<br />purchase will be executed using simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Part 13.5 and for<br />commercial items that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $7,000,000.<br />The requirement is estimated at $368,896 based on commercial catalogue pricing. All equipment<br />will be delivered no later than twenty (20) weeks after award of the order. The contract action<br />will be funded with FY 2019 Other Procurement, Navy (OPN) funds.<br />4. Identification of the justification rationale and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed<br />contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service. 10 U.S.C.<br />2304(c)(l), 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(l)(B).Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or<br />Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements FAR 6.302-l(a)(l)(iii)(B).<br />Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(l), this procurement is sole source for the following reasons.<br />Synchro's and resolvers are transformer-type voltage/current transducers that convert a shaft or<br />other rotating device's angular position and/or velocity to a multi-wire AC electrical signal. Both<br />deliver signals proportional to the Sine and/or Cosine of the shaft angle. A Resolver-to-Digital or<br />a Synchro-to-Digital converter is used to convert these signals to a digital output corresponding<br />to the shaft angle and/or velocity. North Atlantic Industries offers multichannel programmable,<br />isolated output, synchro and/or resolver measurement Synchro/Resolver-to-Digital function<br />modules, for all the multifunction intelligent 1/0 cards and platforms. Covering the range of<br />excitation voltages/ frequency and field parameter programmability, the function modules are<br />able to interface to virtually any type synchro or resolver. All Synchro/Resolver-to-Digital<br />function modules feature background wrap-around self-test capability and most platforms<br />support an optional programmable AC excitation supply synchro modules and connectors<br />manufactured by NAI have been designed and ruggedized to meet harsh shipboard<br />environments. These modules compatible with the PINS system and meet the stringent U.S.<br />Navy environmental requirements of MIL-STD-810E, the critical shock requirements of MIL-S-<br />901D, the vibration requirements of MIL-STD-167, and the EMl/EMC requirements of MILSTD-<br />461E. As such, the Government does not expect significant savings through competition<br />and does expects significant and unacceptable delays that will negatively impact this<br />requirement. Therefore, it is in the Governments' best interest to award on a sole source basis to<br />North Atlantic Industries.<br />5. A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best<br />value consistent with FAR 13.106-l(b).<br />The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the<br />lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to<br />meet the Government's needs.<br />6. A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a<br />statement of the reason market research was not conducted.<br />For the reasons specified in paragraph 4 above, North Atlantic Industries is the only source that<br />can meet the Government's needs. This requirement will be synopsized in the government point<br />of entry fbo.gov.<br />7. Any other facts supporting the justification.<br />None<br />8. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers<br />that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or<br />services is made.<br />As stated in paragraph 4 above, North Atlantic Industries is the only source that can meet this<br />requirement.
<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /> <br /> - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br /> - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br /> - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br /> - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br /> - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br /> - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

<DESC>The proposed acquisition is for the purchase of American Power Company (APC) Power Modules Replacement Service (PMRS) and is essential to NAVSUP Business Systems Center (BSC) requirements.  The APC uninterrupted power supplies (UPS) system that is currently in use by NAVSUP BSC started reporting error messages that indicated the internal batteries needed replaced.  Battery replacement took place on 4 Oct 2019 when it was reported that power modules were reporting faulty. The APC UPS system was placed in a bypass state until the power modules can be replaced. These power modules are required to be replaced before the UPS system can be returned to operational state. Once the APC UPS system is operational and returned online we can begin the process for a preventive maintenance schedule.

This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2019-01 and DFARS Publication Notice 20190215.It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.
The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: https://www.acquisition.gov/far/ and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfarspgi/current/index.html.

This solicitation is issued as a full and open competition.  The NAICS Code is:  334220.  
NAVSUP FLC San Diego, Port Hueneme Office, requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing the following services at Finegayan Guam.  The 10 meter Satellite Tracking Station at Detachment (Det) Charlie Guam supports the Naval Satellite Operations Center (NAVSOC).  The tracking station provides Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding (TT and C) operations of the Navyâ€™s Communication Satellite system.  Software drivers were developed by NAVSOC for the Integrated Satellite Control System (ISCS) to communicate with the Telemetry  and  Communications Systems (TCS) ACU at Det Charlie for status and control capabilities through a secure network architecture.
 Contractor shall upgrade the existing SGLS antenna system at Det C Guam with a mono pulse Auto Track capability in order to allow the antenna to track satellites operating in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  The upgrade may also include the following antenna control system equipment, at a minimum, to support the new mono pulse auto track system or to replace obsolete equipment: antenna control unit, power drive unit, servos, brakes, encoders, synchros, transformers, and cabling.  Effort to be performed in accordance with attached Performance Work Statement.

Delivery Date:  Required no later than 330 days after award. 

Delivery Location: The contractor will provide travel arrangements to Det Charlie Finegayan Guam for on-site installation and testing.
Responsibility and Inspection: Unless otherwise specified in the order, the supplier is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements and quality control.


The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition:

52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (OCT 2018), Subparagraph (c) of the referenced provision is changed to 90 days; 

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014), the fill-in for Subparagraph (a) is:
The factors are listed in order of importance. Non-price evaluation factors, when combined, would be significantly more important than Price.

(I) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT
(II) PAST PERFORMANCE 
(III) PRICE 

The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the two non-price factors.


Offerorsâ€™ proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 

Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.


For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price. 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. 

TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures, drawings or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.
In addition, each offer shall address each of the system requirements. Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation. Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

Offerorsâ€™ PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance.
A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction. Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. 

Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Offerorâ€™s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.
Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03820QB2000012 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2019-06-1 and 2020-01 effective 10 October 2019.
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or an OEM authorized distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceable, genuine OEM parts, and is the only OEM authorized distributor for Airbus Helicopters France parts. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />&#61607; "Requirements - 70Z03820QB2000012" and<br />&#61607; "Terms and Conditions - 70Z03820QB2000012".</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable&nbsp; Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.&nbsp; Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed-Price.</p>
<p><br />As prescribed in 46.302, insert the following clause:</p>
<p>Inspection of Supplies-Fixed-Price (Aug 1996)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</p>
<p>(e) <br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br /><br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</p>
<p>(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</p>
<p>(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either (1)by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2)terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</p>
<p>(i) <br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time-<br /><br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</p>
<p>(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</p>
<p>(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</p>
<p>(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</p>
<p>(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1)at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2)within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>Alternate I (July1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs(g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.</p>
<p>(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either (1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or (2)may terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.</p>
<p><br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1)at no increase in any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in any target price, or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2)within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the total final price as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.</p>
<p>Alternate II (July1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:</p>

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.</p>
<p>(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either (1)by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or (2)terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.</p>
<p><br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1)at no increase in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2)within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l) (2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract.</p>

<DESC>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission. This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase B of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA).
<p>These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (40 USC Chapter 11), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located in NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts), with the potential for work on EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to three (3) HUBZone firms sharing $6 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that more than three (3) contracts should be awarded, based on the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all HUBZone Certified Businesses. Firms are required to maintain their self-certified HUBZone status throughout the life of this contract, or they automatically become ineligible for task order awards.  The ordering period for each contract will be three (3) years with an option for two (2) additional years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded no earlier than August 2019.</p>
<p>Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract ordering period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, knowledge of locality and capacity. These task orders will be firm fixed-price type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders (aside from the $6 million total capacity threshold) and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services.  For the purposes of this procurement, a business is considered a HUBZone Business if it has been certified as a HUBZone business with the Small Business Administration, and therefore meets all of the HUBZone program qualifications, as such.  Under the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as engineering studies, preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, proposed plan, decision document, design, and Title 2 Services.</p>
<p>When the requirement is identified, the government will notify all contractors in the pool that an evaluation will be conducted. The notification will include whether the contractor's SF 330 will be used, or if the government requires unique experience or qualifications to be submitted for the task order evaluation. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents.  A Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the selected firm for each task order.</p>
<p>The Service Contract Labor Standards statute is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts (task orders).  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. Service wage rates will be determined based on the locality where the services will be performed.</p>
<p>Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be eligible for contract award. In order to register in SAM, a firm must have a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B).  If a firm does not have a DUNS number, one can be requested by visiting D&amp;B at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-4212 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website  https://www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.</p>
<p>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required.  It is anticipated that a majority of the work will be performed within NWD under the CERCLA regulatory framework.  These contracts may be used to provide A-E services for EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems, and habitat restoration and mitigation.</p>
<p>Assignments may include Preliminary Assessments, Site Investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, human health and ecological risk assessments, Proposed Plans, Decision Documents, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, vapor intrusion studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking design drawings), Five Year Reviews, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, storm water design (including drainage studies and hydraulic modeling), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, assorted engineering studies and other related services. Task orders may be assigned for any work (HTRW, civil, or military) within the jurisdiction of Northwestern Division or EPA Region 2, but the selection will be based on HTRW program criteria as described in Section 3 Primary Selection Criteria.</p>
<p>3. Primary Selection Criteria: Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion.  Criteria A through E are primary criteria and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>(A) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm demonstrated for a broad range of CERCLA HTRW work performed under the CERCLA regulatory framework.  Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence in sub-criterion 1 and 2 below.  The most highly qualified firms will have experience in all of the following areas:</p>
<p>1.	Remedial Investigations, Risk Assessments (human health and ecological), Feasibility Studies, execution of field investigations including soil and groundwater sampling, and installation of monitoring wells. Experience providing A-E services for HTRW projects located within NWD should also be demonstrated. Direct experience in these areas will be given more consideration than the management or oversight of other contractors (e.g. oversight of PRPs or subcontractors).   Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications by the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms as the Prime/JV.  The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>2.	The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate strong quality management practices by describing quality management roles and responsibilities, by describing their quality management process and procedures, and by documenting application of quality management to field work, work performed by subcontractors, and other engineering work products. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(B) Professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. Relevant HTRW work performed under the CERCLA Regulatory Framework by key personnel will be considered. Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications of key personnel of the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms and for experience on projects included in Section F. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these key disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. Responding firms shall submit resumes for each of the following key disciplines: (1) Project Management; (2) Hydrogeology / Geology; (3) Chemistry; (4) Environmental / Civil Engineering; (5) Risk Assessor.  A maximum of two (2) resumes for Project Manager, and a maximum of one (1) resumes for each of the other disciplines shall be submitted. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section E and Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(C) Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. The Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried by the Government for all firms submitting a SF 330. No submittals are required by the offerors for this criteria. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from CPARS. When evaluating past performances, the board will determine the relevancy of performance evaluations on A-E services contracts and will only consider the 15 most recent and relevant performance evaluations for each firm.</p>
<p>(D) Knowledge of the Locality: The board will evaluate a Prime/JV firm's knowledge and experience with geological features and the state/ local regulatory agencies. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout the USACE NWD (Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Wisconsin and Minnesota). Additional consideration will be given for knowledge and experience of the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F and H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(E) Capacity: The board will consider available capacity of the key disciplines listed in Criteria B from the Prime/JV firm and its team consultants when evaluating the capacity of a firm to perform the work. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H and Part II of the SF 330.</p>
<p>4. Secondary Selection Criteria: The following secondary criterion will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The secondary criterion is Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms.  The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>5. Submittal Requirements:  Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus two (2) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF 330 (08/2016 edition) for the prime firm that includes all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF 330, Part I, Sections B and C. A maximum of five (5) projects for the proposed team, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the five (5) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An IDC contract is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Each project in Section F of the SF 330 shall include the contract number, task order number, cost of work performed by firm, and owner's contact information.  Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, percent of work completed, dates when work was performed, and date of contract completion. Projects submitted must be at least 80% complete or completed in 2014 or later for consideration.</p>
<p>Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall have a total page limitation of 40 printed pages with Section H limited to eight (8) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 40 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages if printed on one side, and four (4) pages if printed on both sides. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11 pt. font. Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal. Any pages that exceed the page limitations noted, will not be evaluated, nor considered.</p>
<p>Submittals must be mailed or delivered to the following address not later than December 7, 2018, at 12:00 pm Noon Central Standard Time (CST) (no faxed or other electronic submittals will be accepted):</p>

<SUBJECT>India - BPCL Petroleum Coke Gasification Project "Technical"
<SOLNBR>2019-31020A 
<RESPDATE>120919
<CONTACT>Anna Amaya, Lead Project Information Specialist, Phone 7038754357, Email RFPQuestions@ustda.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong>
<div>Mr. Sreeram A N<br />General Manager (Project Technical &amp; Petchem)<br />BPCL Kochi Refinery<br />Ambalamughal<br />Ernakulam<br />Kerala<br />India<br />PIN: 682302</div>
<p>Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited ("Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for the Grantee to evaluate options for petroleum coke ("petcoke") gasification at the Grantee's Kochi refinery.  The implementation of petcoke gasification would help BPCL make value-added products that meet environmental emission restrictions in India.</p>
<p>BRIEF PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>BPCL is a government-owned oil and gas company in India with over $40 billion in annual sales.  BPCL operates several refineries in the country, including India's largest public sector refinery in Kochi, a major port city in the southern state of Kerala.  The Kochi refinery has been in operation for more than 50 years and installed a delayed coker unit (DCU) in 2017.  The petcoke produced by the DCU is currently sold as fuel to industrial customers in India, primarily cement manufacturers.  For reasons highlighted above, the use of this petcoke as fuel by cement manufacturers results in significant emissions.</p>
<p>India is the fourth largest energy consumer in the world, and its need for energy supplies continues to climb as a result of the country's dynamic economic growth and modernization.  In order to meet the country's domestic demand for fossil fuels, especially for petroleum-based transportation fuels, the Government of India and the private sector began to focus on investing in refineries in the 1990s.  Thanks to this effort, refining capacity has grown substantially and is expected to continue to grow by 5.3% annually for the next five years.</p>
<p>As Indian refineries are increasingly refining heavy crudes, the petcoke produced via delayed coking contains high amounts of sulfur and toxic heavy metals, such as vanadium, which contributes to the air pollution problem when used as fuel.  To address this issue, the Government of India has recently announced enhanced emissions restrictions due to the potential environmental hazards presented by petcoke.  For example, in 2017, the Supreme Court of India banned the burning of petcoke as a fuel in and around New Delhi.  At the time, the Government of India considered completely banning the burning of petcoke as a fuel nationwide in order to reduce pollution, but failed to do so, presumably due to pressure from industry.  Most refiners believe this ban is inevitable and are evaluating alternative methods of processing petcoke in order to comply with increasingly strict environmental air emission standards while continuing to use petcoke as a revenue stream.</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDY COMPONENTS</p>
<p>BPCL has requested a feasibility study (FS) to explore other methods of petcoke processing at the Kochi refinery.  Specifically, the FS will evaluate options to gasify petcoke, a process that produces synthesis gas which can be used to create several value-added petrochemicals such as methanol, or act as a replacement for natural gas and other fuel sources for power production, steam production and cogeneration.  This methodology would lead to reduced pollution levels as the petcoke would no longer be sold to be burned as fuel.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $731,775 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.   Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.  Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.   Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.   Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 PM IST (6:30 AM EST), December 9, 2019</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Addendum to 52.212-2 EVALUATION SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES
Basis for Award. The Government will issue a purchase order to the responsible quoter whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:
Technical
Price
Past Performance
Evaluation Approach. The Government will evaluate quotations based on a lowest priced, technically acceptable basis.   
Quotations may exceed minimum requirements of the solicitation. The Government reserves the right to select a quotation that provides benefit to the Government that exceeds the minimum requirements of the solicitation, but is not required to do so. Each response must meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. The Government is not requesting or accepting alternate quotations. The evaluation will consider the following: 
Technical: The quotation will be evaluated to the extent to which it can meet and/or exceed the Government s requirements as outlined in the solicitation and based on the information requested in the instructions to quoters section of the solicitation. All salient characteristics of the equipment, delivery time frame, and pick up time frame must be met in order to be technically acceptable.
Price: The Government will evaluate the price by adding the total of all line item prices, including all options .  The Total Evaluated Price will be that sum.
Past Performance: Past performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror s probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. It considers each offerors  demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that met the contract requirements. One performance confidence assessment rating is assigned for each offeror after evaluating the offeror s recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.  Past performance will be evaluated on the relevancy of contractual work performed and how well the contractual work was performed.  If no past performance information is readily available, the Offeror s past performance will be evaluated as Neutral. The Government will research information and databases to aid in establishing contractor s responsibility and ability to perform. The resources for past performance include, but are not limited to past performance questionnaires, D&B, PPIRS, EPLS, SAM, and interviews with Program Managers and Contracting Officers. A Certificate of Competency (COC) may be required prior to receiving award under this solicitation.  If an offeror is unable to obtain a COC, they will no longer be eligible for award.
Options. The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. This includes options under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation. Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by adding six months of the quoter's price for the last potential period of performance under this contract to the quoter's total price.Â  For example, if the contract includes option periods that are exercisable under FAR 52.217-9, the quoter's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, all option periods, and an additional six months of the last option period. Quoters must price only the base and option periods specified in the contract line item numbers (CLINs), and shall not submit a price for the potential six-month extension of services under FAR 52.217-8. The Government reserves the right to exercise the option under FAR 52.217-8 before the end of any of the contractor's performance periods and will be exercised at the price and/or rates in effect at the time the clause is exercised. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

FAR 52.212-3,  Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items  
Offerors must complete annual representations and certifications electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) website located at https://www.sam.gov/portal in accordance with FAR 52.212-3,  Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items.

<DESC>Modifying/Amending the solicitation due to vendor questions:
<p>Question #1. Will there be any special elements to consider? For example, nitrogen in<br />stainless steel. Please let us know if that will need to be factored in for<br />the design of the instrument.</p>
<p>Answer#1. We do NOT require nitrogen or oxygen in any of the methods. I know those two<br />are usually special elements that have to be specifically added to an OES.</p>
<p>Question #2. Calibration Standards will be a significant expense for the number of different matrices and alloys in your SOW. Do you have any certified standards and standardization standards that we could include with our standards when calibrating the instrument? If you do, and if we can use them, it will help to reduce the calibration section of the quotation.</p>
<p>Answer #2. We do NOT have standards for the vendor/contractor to use. They will have to supply all the standards that would be needed.</p>

<DESC>This combined synopsis is amended to include the following: 

This is a 100% set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). 

Set-Aside Requirement:Â  Only verified SDVOSB firms are eligible to submit an offer or receive an award of a VA contract that is set-aside for SDVOSBs in accordance with VAAR Part 819. A non-verified vendor that submits a quote should be rejected as non-responsive or technically unacceptable as listing in VIP is not self-correctable as a minor informality as, for example, a listing in SAM. All other purported SDVOSBs must apply for and receive verified status in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and be listed in VIP prior to submitting a quote on an acquisition conducted in accordance with VAAR Part 819. The VIP database will be checked both upon receipt of an offer and prior to award.

The applicable clauses now include the following:

<DESC>Attaching Questions and Answers.

1. The load bank testing services included in our original scope of work utilized a 100kVA load bank. The
current scope is requesting 750kVA load bank. If deemed acceptable by Eaton, would the government
be accepting of the use of a 100kVA load bank?

Answer â€“
This request is acceptable as long as the load bank is adequately size to support the equipment tested,
and meets all manufactures recommended test requirements.

2. The original proposal submitted was developed with a Monday through Friday contiguous work
effort. The PWS is requesting work be performed across multiple days with a weekend break of no work.
This will result in additional costs.
If all UPS work can be performed across a 5 day period with mitigated
risk, would the customer be accepting of the contiguous Monday through Friday schedule?

Answer â€“
This request is not acceptable. This work shall be performed across multiple days with a weekend break
of no work.

<CONTACT>Eric C. Bowie, Contract Specialist, Phone 8163893178, Email eric.c.bowie@usace.army.mil - Travida D. Byas, Contracting Officer, Phone 8163892029, Email travida.d.byas@usace.army.mil
<DESC>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission. This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase B of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA).
<p>These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (40 USC Chapter 11), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located in NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts), with the potential for work on EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to three (3) HUBZone firms sharing $6 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that more than three (3) contracts should be awarded, based on the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all HUBZone Certified Businesses. Firms are required to maintain their self-certified HUBZone status throughout the life of this contract, or they automatically become ineligible for task order awards. The ordering period for each contract will be three (3) years with an option for two (2) additional years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded no earlier than August 2019.</p>
<p>Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract ordering period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, knowledge of locality and capacity. These task orders will be firm fixed-price type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders (aside from the $6 million total capacity threshold) and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement, a business is considered a HUBZone Business if it has been certified as a HUBZone business with the Small Business Administration, and therefore meets all of the HUBZone program qualifications, as such. Under the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as engineering studies, preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, proposed plan, decision document, design, and Title 2 Services.</p>
<p>When the requirement is identified, the government will notify all contractors in the pool that an evaluation will be conducted. The notification will include whether the contractor's SF 330 will be used, or if the government requires unique experience or qualifications to be submitted for the task order evaluation. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. A Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the selected firm for each task order.</p>
<p>The Service Contract Labor Standards statute is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts (task orders). The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. Service wage rates will be determined based on the locality where the services will be performed.</p>
<p>Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be eligible for contract award. In order to register in SAM, a firm must have a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). If a firm does not have a DUNS number, one can be requested by visiting D&amp;B at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-4212 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website https://www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.</p>
<p>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. It is anticipated that a majority of the work will be performed within NWD under the CERCLA regulatory framework. These contracts may be used to provide A-E services for EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems, and habitat restoration and mitigation.</p>
<p>Assignments may include Preliminary Assessments, Site Investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, human health and ecological risk assessments, Proposed Plans, Decision Documents, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, vapor intrusion studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking design drawings), Five Year Reviews, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, storm water design (including drainage studies and hydraulic modeling), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, assorted engineering studies and other related services. Task orders may be assigned for any work (HTRW, civil, or military) within the jurisdiction of Northwestern Division or EPA Region 2, but the selection will be based on HTRW program criteria as described in Section 3 Primary Selection Criteria.</p>
<p>3. Primary Selection Criteria: Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion. Criteria A through E are primary criteria and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>(A) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm demonstrated for a broad range of CERCLA HTRW work performed under the CERCLA regulatory framework. Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence in sub-criterion 1 and 2 below. The most highly qualified firms will have experience in all of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Remedial Investigations, Risk Assessments (human health and ecological), Feasibility Studies, execution of field investigations including soil and groundwater sampling, and installation of monitoring wells. Experience providing services for HTRW projects located within NWD should also be demonstrated. Direct experience in these areas will be given more consideration than the management or oversight of other contractors (e.g. oversight of PRPs or subcontractors). Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications by the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms as the Prime/JV. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>2. The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate strong quality management practices by describing quality management roles and responsibilities, by describing their quality management process and procedures, and by documenting application of quality management to field work, work performed by subcontractors, and other engineering work products. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(B) Professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. Relevant HTRW work performed under the CERCLA Regulatory Framework by key personnel will be considered. Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications of key personnel of the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms and for experience on projects included in Section F. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these key disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. Responding firms shall submit resumes for each of the following key disciplines: (1) Project Management; (2) Hydrogeology / Geology; (3) Chemistry; (4) Environmental / Civil Engineering; (5) Risk Assessor. A maximum of two (2) resumes for Project Manager, and a maximum of one (1) resumes for each of the other disciplines shall be submitted. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section E and Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(C) Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. The Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried by the Government for all firms submitting a SF 330. No submittals are required by the offerors for this criteria. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from CPARS. When evaluating past performances, the board will determine the relevancy of performance evaluations, and will only consider the 15 most recent and relevant performance evaluations for each firm.</p>
<p>(D) Knowledge of the Locality: The board will evaluate a Prime/JV firm's knowledge and experience with geological features and the state/ local regulatory agencies. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout the USACE NWD (Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Wisconsin and Minnesota). Additional consideration will be given for knowledge and experience of the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F and H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(E) Capacity: The board will consider available capacity of the key disciplines listed in Criteria B from the Prime/JV firm and its team consultants when evaluating the capacity of a firm to perform the work. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H and Part II of the SF 330.</p>
<p>4. Secondary Selection Criteria: The following secondary criterion will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The secondary criterion is Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>5. Submittal Requirements: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus two (2) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF 330 (08/2016 edition) for the prime firm that includes all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF 330, Part I, Sections B and C. A maximum of five (5) projects for the proposed team, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the five (5) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An IDC contract is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Each project in Section F of the SF 330 shall include the contract number, task order number, cost of work performed by firm, and owner's contact information. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, percent of work completed, dates when work was performed, and date of contract completion. Projects submitted must be at least 80% complete or completed in 2014 or later for consideration.</p>
<p>Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall have a total page limitation of 40 printed pages with Section H limited to eight (8) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 40 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages if printed on one side, and four (4) pages if printed on both sides. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11 pt. font. Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal. Any pages that exceed the page limitations noted, will not be evaluated, nor considered.</p>

These facilities under the cognizance of the USACE Chicago District, lie along the banks of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC), which is part of the Chicago Area Waterway system. The barriers were constructed to deter the movement of invasive species, such as Asian Carp, between the Mississippi River and Great Lakes basins. The barrier project currently consists of three distinct parts: Demonstration Barrier I, Barrier IIA, and Barrier IIB. Each of the barriers consists of steel electrodes fastened to the bottom of the canal which send a low-voltage, pulsing direct current (DC) through the water in order to repel invasive fish. Barriers IIA and IIB are located 800 to 1,300 feet downstream of the Demonstration Barrier. They are able to generate a more powerful electric field over a larger area and consist of two independent sets of electrodes and control houses. Each control house and set of electrodes can be operated independently. Barriers IIA and IIB each contain (3) three Pulsed Power Switch Assemblies and the Demonstration Barrier contains (4) four Pulsed Power Switch Assemblies.
<p>By way of this proposed contract, 5S will be required to provide the following Pulsed Power Switch Assemblies:</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE TYPE: Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 336414, Guided Missile and Space Vehicle Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1250 persons.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Armament Directorate, Long Range Systems Division is increasing the potential production quantities of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) from a possible maximum of 4,900 to a possible maximum of approximately 10,000 and the quantities of Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) from a possible maximum of 110 to a possible maximum of approximately 400 additional missiles. The increased quantities for JASSM will be procured in Lots 18 through 24 and the increased LRASM quantities will be procured in Lots 4 through 8.</p>
<p>This effort also includes sustainment efforts to include operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness. In addition to the JASSM-ER/LRASM missile hardware and software, this weapon system includes telemetry instrumentation kits, precision targeting image software, the JASSM Weapon System Simulator, technical data, obsolescence management, upgrades, production implementation, pre-planned product improvement, sustainment, aircraft integration, non-warranty repair, containers, tooling, and other related items. Associated support items include, but are not limited to, replacement parts, program management, engineering, logistics, test support, support equipment, software/hardware upgrades to support production missiles, associated data, and any other supplies or services needed to sustain the program over the life of the system, as well as all facilities, equipment, labor, tools and test equipment. Sustainment activities include JASSM-ER system repair, container requirements, and repairable/replaceable components of these end items plus the repair infrastructure; and any other supplies or services needed to sustain the JASSM/JASSM-ER program over the life of the system. Repair infrastructure includes program management, replacement parts, special tooling maintenance, business management, hardware demilitarization/disposal and administrative support. Sustainment requirements are anticipated to include the capability and capacity to repair non-warranted missiles and other support items that may occur proportional to the estimated increased missile quantities listed above.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of the supplies/services listed above will be executed sole source to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC) in Orlando, FL and Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems (LM RMS) in Mount Laurel, New Jersey under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". The program is supported by the LMMFC manufacturing facility complex, which is uniquely capable of sustaining the Full Rate Production (FRP) of JASSM/LRASM, a major weapon system. LMMFC has supply chain management capability and maintains key relationships with vital suppliers across the multi service complex. LMMFC has the engineering personnel and program management expertise based on experience to support continuous improvement and production upgrade efforts. There is a direct working relationship between LMMFC and LM RMS. JASSM software includes specialized aspects of the overall mission planning software that only LM RMS can provide. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Foreign participation is not authorized.</p>

*******************
*******************

This announcement is a Market Survey / Request for Information for the purpose of soliciting feedback regarding existing capabilities from educational providers to meet FAA Cybersecurity training needs. Responses to this announcement will be used for informational purposes only to support the development of an acquisition strategy for the contemplated Cybersecurity Training Initiative (CTI). The information will not be released, except as required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked. This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal.  

In accordance with the National Cyber Strategy released by the White House in September 2018, the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) has a requirement to develop a robust and well-trained cybersecurity workforce. Accordingly, the  FAA has a requirement to develop a cybersecurity training program that would include the following FAA Cybersecurity training needs: 

1. Develop and maintain Cybersecurity curriculum in the areas of:
         - Critical Infrastructure, Resilience, and Protection
         - Safety Assurance & Risk Management
         - National Security Policies & Reporting
         - FAA Familiarization & CyTF Table Exercise (Capstone)

2.  Deliver Instructor Led Training (ILT)
3.  Develop and implement continuing education training for cybersecurity advances and innovations.
4.  Training to individuals leading to formal accreditation in the field of Cybersecurity.

The FAA requests responses from industry to address the following: 
 
1. Describe your firmâ€™s understanding and experience with FAA training procedures and methods, including FAA Standard 028.  

2. Describe your capability and experience developing and maintaining a comprehensive cybersecurity training curriculum in the areas described above.

3. Identify the customers for whom you have provided a cybersecurity training program and provide a list of courses developed including a brief course synopsis.

4. Describe your capabilities for conducting online or distance educational programs.   

5. Describe your cadre of resources (e.g. instructional designers and training instructors) and their experience developing cybersecurity training programs.

6. Describe your firmâ€™s ability to provide flexible classroom training including in-residence environments such as a FAA facility. 

7. Describe your experience providing continuing education training for cybersecurity advances and innovations. 

8. Describe some of the challenges, lessons learned, and successes in developing a cybersecurity educational/ training program.

9.  Describe if you have conducted a program that leads to a cybersecurity degree and / or certificate, both on-site and web-based, as well as professional certification and program accreditation for a Government organization.  What were the significant obstacles you encountered and how did you overcome those obstacles?

This Market Survey must not be construed as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these items.  Since this is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal, no results will be issued to the responding firms. No solicitation for these items exists currently. If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the FAA Contract Opportunities website. It is the vendorâ€™s responsibility to monitor the website for release of the solicitation.  The FAA will not entertain or accept unsolicited proposals for this work.

The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this Market Survey, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.  Any costs associated with the Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested partyâ€™s expense.  

The FAA may request that one, some, all, or none of the respondents to the Market Survey/Request for Information provide additional information. No evaluation of vendors will occur based on this additional information, and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA. 

Interested vendorsâ€™ responses must be submitted by email no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on November 18, 2019.  Responses to this Market Survey are limited to 15 pages, must be in writing, on company letterhead, and must include respondent point of contact information including name, telephone number, e-mail address, and mailing address. Any proprietary information submitted must be properly identified. Information from vendor submissions may be used in future acquisition activities on a non-vendor specific basis.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole source, fixed price Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with a base year and 4 option years, with Artel, Inc., 25 Bradley Drive, Westbrook, ME, 04092-2013.  The purpose of the BPA is for procuring Reagents and Plates for its existing Multi-channel Verification System (MVS).  BPA is not to exceed 25,000 per year.
<p>The FBI's Federal DNA Database Unit (FDDU), the DNA Casework (DCU), and the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) currently utilizes the Artel MVS for verifying the precision and accuracy of all the robotic stations used for casework, research, database and validation studies. Each MVS measures reagents to ensure the precise volume is applied to the robots. The Artel Reagents and Plates are required to keep the robotic stations running efficiently. They are critical to the quality assurance and quality control processes and must be compatible with current laboratory procedure manuals.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Artel Reagents and Plates are the only products that can be used on the FBI's existing MVS. Artel, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and the only authorized distributor of the required products.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, per FAR 5.207(16)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  All capability statements or quotes shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer Adelle Bolton by email.  The email address is <strong>albolton@fbi.gov</strong> Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) Requirement <br />Vendors must be registered in the System for Awards Management (SAM.gov) to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate.

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Code 210.P, Office for Program Support, intends to negotiate solely with SEAKR Engineering located in Centennial, Colorado to deliver an Optical Module Control Electronics System that NASA GSFC requires in order to meet program milestones. This action is in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".
<p>NASA GSFC requires a copy of the optical communications system that will fly on the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis-2 II mission. This system is required to meet all of the Orion technical interfaces. The Control Electronics (CE) unit is one of five subsystems that make up the full optical communications system. Each subsystem is required to maintain the interfaces with the others for the system to work. In addition, each subsystem must be available for the Orion flight should the need arise, precluding time for new development in the schedule. The CE unit's primary function is to interface with external sensors and loads through hardware and digital control loops in the CE. The CE will receive commands and configuration updates, and supply telemetry via a MIL-STD-1553B and up to two (2) Space Wire ports.</p>
<p>SEAKR Technology, Inc. possesses the knowledge and development expertise to provide and deliver within schedule the Optical Module Control Electronics System NASA GSFC requires in order to meet program milestones.

Proposed office space is on the first floor or below the first floor of the building.<br />2.	Proposed office space is on the top floor of the building and rooftop access is within the space.<br />3.	Proposed office space has public parking underneath or within the building.<br />4.	Proposed office space is inside a shopping mall or shopping center.  <br />5.	Proposed building houses day care facilities, abortion clinics, mental health clinics, or drug rehabilitation clinics, immigration, probations, public defenders, and/or social services (including but not limited to: Social Security Administration (SSA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)) within the building.<br />6.	Proposed building has metered or public parking directly in front or next to the building.<br />7.	Proposed building will not or cannot accommodate secured parking for TENANT official vehicles at this facility. <br />8.	Proposed building is within 225 feet of residential areas, 1,000 feet of places of worship, schools, hospitals, prisons, or abortion clinics, mental health clinics, and/or 900 feet of day care facilities.<br />9.

Any exceptions or variances to the above listed criteria must be approved in writing, by the Chief, Physical Security Programs Branch.<br />11.	If TENANT cannot find a building within the central business district (see Executive Order 12072), which satisfies our security requirements, then TENANT must be allowed to expand the delineated area so that a safe, secure building can be found.</p>

<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under a lease in Glendale, California that will be expiring.  The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>SAT)

Acquisition Plan Action ID: _36C250-19-AP-6342_

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10, Battle Creek VA Medical Center (BCVAMC) (515), Network Contracting Office 10, 24 Frank Lloyd Wright Drive, Lobby M, Suite 2200
Ann Arbor, MI 48105.

Purchase Request/2237# 515-19-4-043-1162

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: A short-term firm-fixed price contract for 2.8 FTE (6,000 hours annually) Medical Officer of the Day (MOD) physician services for the Battle Creek VA Medical Center (BCVMC).  The period of performance is from 9/21/2019 to 9/20/2020. 

The previous contract (BPA 36C25019A0041/Task Order 36C25019A0041), awarded 5/29/2019 to
A-Team Solutions, LLC, (A-Team) with an effective date of 8/5/2019 was terminated for cause   effective 9/21/2019. 

The failure of A-Team Solutions, LLC (A-Team) to ensure the proposed physicians for this contract timely submit and complete all required documentation required for credentialing resulted in 
A-Team not providing MOD Physician services for the Battle Creek VA Medical Center on August 18th, 25th, 26th to 31st and September 2nd, 3rd and 5th.  A Show Cause Notice was issued to 
A-Team on September 6, 2019 and a termination notice was issued on September 17th with an effective termination date of September 21, 2019. 

The Termination Notice referenced the Performance Work Statement of the BPA which required the contractor to provide 2.8 FTE MOD Physician services at the Battle Creek VAMC from 6:00pm to 7:00am, Monday through Thursday and 6:00 pm thru 7:00 am on weekends and holidays.  The failure to provide credentialed MOD physicians constituted a default of the contract.  A-Team solutions only filled 61% of the required shifts in August 2019, 63% of the shifts in September 2019 and 43% of the projected shifts in October 2019.

Vista Staffing Solutions, Inc. (Vista) immediately provided a number of previously-credentialed (at the BCVAMC) MOD physicians for MOD services at the BCVAMC.  A new contract, 36C25019C0284, was awarded to Vista Staffing Solutions, Inc. (Vista) on 9/20/2019 with an effective date of 9/21/2019.  


Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  An emergency short-term contract for 2.8 FTE (6,000 hours annually) Medical Officer of the Day (MOD) physician services for the Battle Creek VA Medical Center was awarded.  The period of performance is from 9/21/2019 to 9/20/2020 which allows for time to solicit and award a new, long-term new contract plus time to onboard the new physicians.  Onboarding, which includes completing the credentialing and background investigation processes, can take several weeks.  Services under the short-term contract are to be performed during the hours of 6:00 pm to 7:00 am Monday through Thursday and 6:00 pm Friday through 7:00 am Monday (the entire weekend) and all federal holidays.  The contract total is $1,014,000.00.  

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 (  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (X) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;



Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

The previous contract identified in Section 2 above was terminated for cause effective 9/21/2019.  The need for these direct patient care services necessitated that a new contract needed to be put in place as expeditiously as possible in order to prevent an adverse impact to patient care.  The former contractor, Vista Staffing Solutions, Inc. provided MOD physician services to the BCVAMC under Contract VA251-16-F-1709 which expired 8/15/2019.  Vista has many physicians already credentialed at the BCVAMC and expressed an interest in providing services starting on 9/21/2019.   Only those physicians previously credentialed at the Battle Creek VA Medical Center could complete an abbreviated credentialing process and immediately provide services for the BCVAMC.  Due to the time required to solicit and award a new contract, as well as the lengthy credentialing process required of a contractor with non-credentialed physicians, Vista Staffing was uniquely qualified to provide the required services without undue delay and impact to patient care.  

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  A special notice was published to FBO (36C25019Q1447_1) on 9/18/2019. The notice listed the proposed contract action and closed on 9/19/2019.  One (1) response by an SDVOSB staffing company, Millbrook, Support Services, Inc., who simply introduced themselves and provided a capability statement, was received.  
 
Determination by the CO that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The quoted pricing from Vista Staffing Solutions of $1,014,000 is determined to be fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 8.405-3(b)(2)(vii) based on a comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on past purchases. Contract VA251-16-F-1709, MOD Physician Services for the Battle Creek VAMC, which ended 8/15/2019, had a total price of $1,012,141 at an hourly rate of $169 per hour.  The new contract is also priced at $169 per hour.  

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: The last contract action was set aside to SDVOSB vendors on GSA, under SIN 621-001, primary care physicians.  The VIP database for this procurement was checked, utilizing the NAICS code of 561320, with numerous results.  However, the VA Rule of Two did not apply as the contract action was procured under Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2.  



Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Vista Staffing Solutions, Inc, 2800 E. Cottonwood Pkwy, STE 400, Cottonwood Heights, UT 84121.  

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  A replacement contract, awarded on a competitive basis, with a base and four option years, will be awarded with an effective date of June 21, 2020. 


Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
