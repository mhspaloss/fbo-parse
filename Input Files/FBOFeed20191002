<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source, firm-fixed price contract, as authorized by FAR 13.106-1   soliciting from a single source. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 23 intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to Candelis, Inc. for proprietary maintenance services on ImageGridTM archive hardware.  Vendor shall be an OEM, authorized dealer, authorized distributor, or authorized reseller for the proposed medical supplies, medical equipment, and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts), verified by an authorization letter or other documents from the OEM, such that the OEM s warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM.Â All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.  VA requires the proprietary maintenance and emergency repair services from Candelis, Inc. because the parts, maintenance and repair services are unique or proprietary to Candelis, Inc.  Market research revealed that Candelis, Inc. is the only authorized provider allowed to perform maintenance on ImageGridTM equipment currently being utilized by VA. The prime contractor for the maintenance and repair services must be Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certified, offer OEM parts, and shall not provide gray market items.  Gray market items are OEM goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors.  No remanufactured or gray market items will be acceptable.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 811219 and the service code is J065. 
While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the requirement.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  The Government understands that Candelis, Inc. is the only vendor that can provide the requested services.  However, vendors that believe they can provide the capabilities required to fully meet the Government's requirement may submit information in writing to john.breyer@va.gov by 3:00 PM Central Time on October 9, 2019.  Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 with a small business size standard of 1,250 employees. <br /><br />The Government requires the purchase of two (2) Quad Receiver Digisonde Portable Sounder and, two (2) 4 Receiving Turnstile Loop Antennas two (2) 4 Polarization Switches / Preamplifiers; System Performance Evaluation and Training and Dual Delta Turnstile Transmit Antenna.
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>Lowell Digisonde International, LLC (LDI)<br />175 Cabot Street, Suite 200<br />Lowell, MA 01854, USA</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. This DPS4D system is the only known system capable of providing a real-time electron density profile as well as a vertical ionospheric total electron content count. It also provides real-time International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) profile shape parameters (B0, B1, D1) for 3D ionospheric modeling, and real-time plasma drift velocity evaluation. Further, the system is able to mitigate strong in-band HF interferers via their patented RF Interference Mitigation (RFIM) method. This system also provides the capability to "null" frequency bands during a scan (selectively omit frequencies). Finally, the USAF currently has an expansive network of DPS4D systems in use globally for R&amp;D: utilizing systems directly compatible with these deployed systems will allow AFRL/RITF to align interests and seamlessly collaborate on USAF projects.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quote, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 September 2019.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees.&nbsp;

<div><br />Brief Description of Requirements:</div>
<div><br />&bull;	1282968: PALADIN SCAN 532-36000 Laser System</div>
<div><br />o	Wavelength 532 nm<br />o	Output power 36W<br />o	Repetition rate: 76 MHz plus/minus 1 MHz<br />o	Pulse length: &lt; 25 ps @ 532 nm<br />o	Spatial Mode: TEM00<br />o	M^2: &lt;1.2<br />o	Beam Waist diameter (@1/e^2): 1.35 mm plus/minus 15%<br />o	Beam Divergence: &lt;750 &mu;rad (full angle)<br />o	Beam Ellipticity: 0.9 to 1.1<br />o	Pointing stability after warm-up: &lt;20 &mu;rad/K after<br />o	Polarization: Linear, &gt;100:1, vertical, linear<br />o	Long Term Power Stability: &lt;&plusmn;2%<br />o	Noise (20 MHz bandwidth over 100s): &lt;1% RMS<br />o	Max warm-up time: &lt;30 min from standby
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for the purchase of the requirement described above. The identified sole-source provider/producer of this laser system is as follows:</p>
<p><br />Coherent Inc.<br />5100 Patrick Henry Drive<br />Santa Clara, CA 95054</p>
<p>Coherent is the only known manufacturer of a 355nm picosecond pulsed laser that will satisfy the requirements of the Government's trapped ion lab experiment. Specifically, the Coherent laser is the only known source that can meet the required average power needs and which also possesses the necessary frequency, pulse width, and repetition rate needed in the experimental setup.  This setup cannot be modified without jeopardizing the entire experiment. This system has been proven to be successful in similar peer experiments and the Government's experiment cannot be successfully performed without the use of this specific laser. If this system is not procured from Coherent, there will be significant technical capability degradation to the future experiments of the Government, potentially causing the inability to meet yearly program milestones. Procurement of a different brand system will add an estimated 4 months or more of development effort by a PhD ($150k) to make that system usable in the Government's experiment. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirement.</p>
<p><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Tabitha.Haggart@us.af.mil</p>
<p><br />Responses to this notice must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or after 20 September 2019.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811219 with a small business size standard of $20,500,000 in average annual revenue. <br /><br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract a radiometer repair with:<br />ATS Services, Ltd<br />35 Auriga Drive, Unit 213<br />Ottawa ON K2E 8B7<br />1-613-221-9815<br />POC: Larry Malenfant
<p>The requirement is for the repair the RPG Model LWP-U72+U72.5/82.5 radiometer, serial number R-LWP-U72+82 - 10/001. This includes repair of various defective and damaged components, replacement of internal SATA DOM, replacement of cooling fans, and replacement of radome sheet with custom internally fabricated hardware, custome firmware and software. Original equipment manufacturer is Radiometer Physics GmbH (RPG), Werner-von-Siemens-Str. 4, 53340 Meckenheim, Germany.</p>
<p>Market research to date has determined that no other source can meet the requirements, most notably ATS is the authorized US distributer and agent for RPG. A party other than ATS servicing, altering, or performing the requirement described in this notice would void existing warranties and agreements.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to richard.childres@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 15 SEP 2019.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>INU TEQ, LLC has a requirement for an upgrade to a System Switch Digital Differential, part no. S2560FX-33-1A, Adapter Panel-Active Digital, part no. AP32BTI-076, Adapter Panel Active Digital, part no. AP32BTO-0D6 AND Adapter Panel Passive, part no. AP32R2-006.
<p>INU TEQ intends to purchase the items from Universal Switching Corporation, 7671 N. San Fernando Road, Burbank, California 91505.</p>
<p>Procurement falls under FAR6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). This is a follow on procurement upgrading existing property.<br />The hardware infrastructure dictates the same form-factor and proprietary modules and components specific to this supplier. Other similar equipment does not have the same interfaces and capabilities with what is already installed and in use. The specifications of similar equipment have been examined but do not measure up to Universal Switching features, capabilities, and technical support.</p>
<p>This purchase will allow for an additional Universal Switching Corp. Switch matrix device with the current system located at NASA AFRC. This switch is an enhancement to an existing System. All other components shall remain as Universal Switching Corp. Switch for interface and control reasons. Any other switch will have to utilize or accept control by Universal Switching systems proprietary GUI (Route Ware Pro) or NASA create GUI software. Any other solution would require the rewrite of existing control software (maintain commonality) and would be an unacceptable cost to the Government and require unreasonable lead time with completely new documentation rewrite and engineering plan. A common set of spare parts already exist for system maintenance, such as front panel keyboard, processors and power supplies. With this procurement system commonality will also allow existing personnel labor. The primal goal is common and familiar equipment.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.<br /><br />Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on October 17, 2019.</p>
<p>Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for a 100% set-aside for small businesses under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 519130 "Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals," with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP)) is contemplating an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award for an information technology partnership network and communication technology project entitled, "National Prevention Information Network (NPIN)." The anticipated period of performance for the contract is sixty months. Place of Performance will be determined on individual task orders. The solicitation Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available on the Internet at http://www.fbo.gov on or about July 18, 2019. Requests for Proposals in hard copy form will not be available to interested parties. Telephone requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.<br /><br /><strong>Background for the Acquisition:</strong> The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is one of three national Centers housed within CDC's Office of Infectious Diseases (OID).The National Center for HIV/AIDS, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP) was established in 1994 to bring together most of CDC's HIV prevention activities under a single organizational home with Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention and Tuberculosis (TB) Elimination Programs. In 2006, CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) was added, and the Center was renamed the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.</p>
<p>The diseases addressed by NCHHSTP share a number of commonalities. They have similar or overlapping at-risk populations-including racial and ethnic minorities, men who have sex with men (MSM), and injection drug users (IDUs). These diseases also have important interactions. Those who are infected with certain STDs, such as syphilis or gonorrhea, are at greater risk for HIV infection. Likewise, those who are infected with HIV are far more susceptible to TB disease because their immune systems are weakened.</p>
<p>These diseases also share similar social determinants, including poor access to health care, stigma, discrimination, homophobia, and poverty. In the area of prevention and control, effective, science-based interventions exist to reduce the burden of TB, Viral Hepatitis, most STDs, and HIV.</p>
<p>NPIN is congressionally mandated by the Health Omnibus Extension of 1988 which, "Authorizes the Secretary, through the Director of the CDC, to establish a clearinghouse to make information on AIDS available to Federal agencies, States, public and private entities, and the general public. Allows the clearinghouse to: (1) develop and obtain educational materials, model curricula, and methods regarding reducing the transmission of the etiologic agent; (2) provide instruction and support for individuals who provide instruction regarding prevention of AIDS; and (3) conduct evaluations of such materials, curricula, and methods."<br /><br /><strong>Project Objectives:</strong> The purpose of this contract is to procure the necessary services for the NPIN Program to fulfill its congressionally mandated mission.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide services that fall within the scope of the work for the project entitled, "National Prevention Information Network (NPIN)" administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of the National Center for HIV/AIDs, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD), and Tuberculosis (TB) Programs - (NCHHSTP).<br /><br /><strong>General Scope of Work:</strong>The services to be acquired under this contract provide a mechanism for various information technology, health communication, and health education professional services tasks, studies, and projects to be performed for NCHHSTP. Services to be performed will be non-personal and not inherently governmental services in nature. As an independent organization and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish all necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, and equipment, to provide NCHHSTP with required scientific, technical, and operational services, within the general work parameters set forth in this Performance Work Statement. Contractor's performance and all resulting deliverables must adhere to all federal, HHS, and/or CDC IT security policies and procedures. All resource materials produced or maintained under this contract, including databases, all information products, all data, mailing lists, websites, telephone protocols (Intellectual Property), etc., are the property of the Government. <br /><br /><strong>Follow-On Requirement:</strong> This requirement is a follow-on contract requirement.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA or Agency) intends to award a contract to Leidos for the continued system integration, sustainment, and enhancement of Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) capability into the National Airspace System (NAS). This award will be on a single source basis pursuant to AMS 3.2.2.4 Single Source Contracting.

On November 5, 2018, Market Survey No. 31843 was posted regarding the FAA requirement for the continued system integration, sustainment, and enhancement of TBFM currently performed under contract DTFAWA-10-C-00052. The purpose of the Market Survey was to determine availability of competition to sustain and enhance within specific intrinsic aspects of the existing TBFM system.

Based on the results of the market survey, the Agency has determined adequate competition does not exist to conduct an unrestricted competition for the continued system integration, sustainment, and enhancement of TBFM. This single source will put the FAA in a position to revisit a competition in 2025.

The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. Any questions relating to this announcement may be directed to the Contracting Officer, Joyce Edwards-Williams, joyce.edwards-williams@faa.gov no later than 5:00 PM EDT October 18, 2019

VA NOTICE OF TOTAL SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE (JUL 2019) (DEVIATION)

(1) Means a small business concern 
(i) Not less than 51 percent of which is owned by one or more service-disabled Veterans or, in the case of any publicly owned business, not less than 51 percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more service-disabled Veterans or eligible surviving spouses (see VAAR 802.201, Surviving Spouse definition);
(ii) The management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more service-disabled Veterans (or eligible surviving spouses) or, in the case of a service-disabled Veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such Veteran;
(iii) The business meets Federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code identified in the solicitation document;
(iv) The business has been verified for ownership and control pursuant to 38 CFR 74 and is so listed in the Vendor Information Pages database, (https://www.vip.vetbiz.va.gov); and
(v) The business will comply with VAAR subpart 819.70 and Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations regarding small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 121.406 and 125.6, provided that any reference therein to a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern (SDVO SBC), is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB. The nonmanufacturer rule and the limitations on subcontracting apply to all SDVOSB and VOSB set-asides and sole source contracts.
(2)  Service-disabled Veteran  means a Veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16).
(b) General.
(1) Offers are solicited only from eligible service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns. Only VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns (SDVOSBs) may submit offers in response to this solicitation. Offers received from concerns that are not VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns shall not be considered.
(2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern that meets the size standard for the applicable NAICS code.
(c) Representation. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpart 819.70. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible. Therefore, any reference in 13 CFR part 121 and 125 to a service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern (SDVO SBC), is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB and only such concern(s) qualify as similarly situated. The offeror must also be eligible at the time of award.
(d) Agreement.Â  When awarded a contract (see FAR 2.101, Definitions), including orders under multiple-award contracts, or a subcontract, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR part 121.406 and 125.6, provided that for purposes of the limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs shall be considered eligible and/or  similarly situated  (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An independent contractor shall be considered a subcontractor. An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to the following:
(1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.
(2) Supplies or products.
(i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.
(ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a nonmanufacturer, it will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver is described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) is granted.
(3) General construction. In the case of a contract for general construction, it will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.
(4) Special trade contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, it will not pay more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.
(5) Subcontracting. Any work that a VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. For mixed contracts and additional limitations, refer to 13 CFR 125.6.
(e) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any reference therein to service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern or SDVO SBC, is to be construed to mean a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants.
(f) Precedence. For any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA program for service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns and the VA Veterans First Contract Program, as defined in VAAR subpart 819.70 and this clause, the VA Veterans First Contracting Program requirements have precedence.

<SOLNBR>NNA13AA12Bext
<RESPDATE>101719
<ARCHDATE>10202019
<CONTACT>Marla P Lefevre, Contract Specialist, Phone 650-604-5775, Email marla.p.lefevre@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) intends to extend contract NNA13AA12B (Safety, Environmental, and Medical Support Services (SEMSS) with Earth Resources Technology, Inc. (ERT) on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.. The performance period will be extended for a maximum of six (6) months (November 16, 2019 - May 15, 2020), consisting of a three (3) month base period and three (3) one-month option periods. A contract modification reflecting this extension and resultant contract value increase will be issued on or before November 15, 2019, the expiration date of the contract.
<p>The current Contractor provides the following mission critical Occupational Health and Safety support services under SEMSS: Occupational Safety, Industrial Hygiene (IH), Health Physics (HP) and Occupational Medicine to Operate the Health Unit and Maintain Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) certification of the Ames Health Unit (HU); Implement programs that assure the safety and health of all employees; Provide oversight to ensure that all ARC operations are carried out in compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local regulations and NASA policies; Implement the NASA Safety Accountability Program at ARC; and Maintain Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) certification at the STAR level.</p>
<p>The current Contractor provides the following mission critical Environmental support services under SEMSS: Ensure that the Hazardous Waste Program is compliant with regulatory requirements including collection, processing, and manifesting hazardous waste for disposal; Ensure environmental impacts are thoroughly assessed, documented, and mitigated to the extent practicable; Ensure facility wide operations are carried out in compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, and NASA policies and procedural requirements; Raise awareness among Center personnel, Resident Agencies, tenant partners, and applicants for grants, leases, use permits, and other Federally-funded or approved actions, and the public of applicable Federal, State, and local and NASA environmental policies and procedural requirements and environmental program activities. Ensure effective interagency cooperation, communication, and consultation. Identify opportunities for reducing cost, delay, and paperwork, and consider safety in all tasks.</p>
<p>The extension will increase the current contract value by approximately $6,000,000 if the base and all options are exercised. The current contractor, ERT, is considered the only contractor that can meet ARC's needs given the short period of performance for the extension.  Awarding a six-month contract to another source, at the same time as the re-competition of the follow-on is in process, would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements and not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARC's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 4 PM PDT on October 17, 2019. Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the extension can be sent via email to Marla Lefevre at marla.p.lefevre@nasa.gov</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html  .</p>

This notice is issued solely for information purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP). This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service.

Number of calendar days to complete construction is to be determined by the AE firm after the design is complete.

SELECTION CRITERIA/DESCRIPTIONS
The selection criteria descriptions are provided below. 

PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS NECESSARY FOR SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE OF REQUIRED SERVICES. 
Provide brief resumes of proposed team members who will specifically serve as the Project Managers and Designers of Record. The Designers of Record shall perform and direct the design within their respective discipline and shall sign and seal the drawings. All Designers of Record must be professionally registered in their discipline. Each resume shall include a minimum of two (2) specific completed projects that best illustrate the individual team members experience relevant to this contract scope;

SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE
Specialized experience and technical competence required for this specific project, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.

CAPACITY
This factor evaluates the ability of the firm, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the possible myriad of design projects in the required time. 

The general workload and staffing capacity of the design office will be evaluated.
List current projects with a design fee of greater than $20,000 being designed in the firms  office. 
Indicate the firms  present workload and the availability 
of the project team (including sub-consultants) for the specified contract performance period;
Describe experience in successfully delivering projects per 
performance schedule, providing timely construction support, and successfully completing multiple projects with similar delivery dates


PAST PERFORMANCE: VISN2 will evaluate past performance on recent and relevant contracts with government  agencies (emphasis on VA work) and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules and a record of significant claims against the firm due to improper or incomplete engineering services (references required). 
Recent is defined as performance occurring within 5 years of the date of this Sources Sought, except that ongoing projects must have begun no less than one (1) year prior to the issuance of this Sources Sought.
Relevancy is defined as performance of work on projects that are similar in scope to the types of projects anticipated under the resultant contracts.
Respondents with no previous past performance shall state this when addressing the selection criteria. Where there is no record of past performance, the proposal will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements: 
Submit a minimal of three (3) references; any of the following evaluations are acceptable:
Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS), or 
Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project submitted under Criterion 2.
If a completed CPARS evaluation is available, it shall be submitted with the completed SF330 package. If there is not a completed CPARS evaluation, the PPQ included with this notice is provided for the Offeror or its team members to submit for each project included in criterion (2). If a PPQ is submitted, but an official CPARS evaluation is found for that project in government databases, the official evaluation will take precedence. If a CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for each contract customer/reference. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF330. If the A-E is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a contract customer/reference for a project before the response date set forth in this notice, the A-E should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment #1), including contract and point of contact information for the respective projects. 
A-Es should follow-up with references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. At the reference s request, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Governments point of contact, Richard Adu via email at Richard.Adu@va.gov , prior to the response date. A-Es shall not incorporate by references into their response CPARS or PPQ evaluations previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation. Submitted CPARS and PPQ evaluations shall be attached to the SF330, behind the SF330 Part II document.

LOCATION
The A/E Firm proximity to the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 79 Middleville Road, Northport, NY 11768-2200 is an evaluation criteria.  
This distance is determined according to http://maps.google.com/

(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, General Management, and cooperativeness.

(8) Specific Experience and Qualifications of personnel proposed assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.

PLEASE NOTE: The AE Evaluation Board must be provided with complete and accurate information for ALL eight (8) evaluation factors above in order to rank as qualified and eligible firms. Therefore, the AE firm must expand upon, as it deems necessary, on any evaluation factor not well demonstrated or addressed with Part 1A to Part IG and Part II of the SF330.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) for Fresh Fruit & Vegetable support for DLA Troop Support's DoD and Non-DoD customers (USDA Schools and Reservations) located in State of Washington and parts of Oregon
<SOLNBR>SPE300-20-R-0002
<RESPDATE>101619
<CONTACT>Stephanie Milstein, Contracting Specialist, Phone 2157373674, Email stephanie.milstein@dla.mil - Susan M. Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-737-0726, Fax 215-737-4246, Email susan.m.williams@dla.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information ("RFI").  DLA Troop Support's ("Agency") Subsistence Produce Program is interested in comments and feedback regarding the Agency's full line produce support to Department of Defense ("DoD;" Troop), United States Department of Agriculture  ("USDA;" Schools) and Reservation customers throughout the Continental United States ("CONUS").  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment from the Government and any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Please note that by responding to the instant Agency request, a potential offeror is not promised any future business with the Government.  The sole purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to assist the Agency in creating an appropriate solicitation in the future.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background: The Agency intends to issue a solicitation and ultimately enter into indefinite quantity contract(s) ("IQC") with a commercial firm(s) to supply a full-line of United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") Grade Number 1 or better quality fresh fruits and vegetables ("FF&amp;V") and Shell Eggs (if required by the customers) to Department of Defense ("DoD", or "Troop"), USDA  ("Schools") and Reservations customers in the State of Washington and parts of Oregon Zone.  Specific quality requirements per item are included in the Schedule of Items (Attachment 1).  When proposing in response to a solicitation, failure to propose the specified quality requirement per item as identified in Attachment 1 may render an offeror's proposal technically unacceptable.  If the item's description in Attachment 1 does not provide a specific quality grade, the minimum quality grade that is required to meet the terms of this Solicitation is USDA Grade Number 1.</p>
<p><br />In the solicitation that is contemplated, the aforementioned zone will be comprised of three (3) Groups in the area described above. Group 1 will consist of DoD customers to include Washington Troops and  United States Coast Guard (USCG) customers in Oregon. Group 2 will consist of non-DoD customers to include School &amp; Reservation in Western Washington zone. Group 3 will consist of non-DoD customers to include School &amp; Reservation in the Eastern Washington zone. After soliciting, the Agency intends to make one award per Group.  Offerors may submit a proposal for any Group or a combination of Groups.  Offerors are required to propose on all items in the Schedule of Items for each Group on which it offers.  Failure to do so may result in a proposal being deemed technically unacceptable and therefore excluded from further consideration for award.  Because the Contracting Officer is not obligated to initiate negotiations, when proposing to the solicitation each offeror shall submit its most competitive proposal for each Group it has chosen to propose on.  Said proposal shall be responsive to all of the Solicitation's requirements and free from any deficiencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the attachments: Schedule of Items, Delivery Schedule and Market Research questions. If interested, we strongly encourage you to respond. We appreciate, and thank you in advance for any feedback. Your responses regarding this solicitation are requested back by the close of business on October 16, 2019. Please respond via e-mail to the following addresses: stephanie.milstein@dla.mil and susan.m.williams@dla.mil.</p>

3.  Size of business:  Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, Woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, or other category

4.  If the services can be obtained from an existing Government contract vehicle, to include the General Services Administration (GSA) or Seaport Next Generation (NxG), provide the applicable contract number.

5.
 Indicate if your company can be a prime contractor for this effort or, if not, whether your company can be a subcontractor.  If subcontractors are to be used, provide the anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and if a small or large business subcontractor(s) will be used.

6.  The Government is determining the acquisition strategy for this potential acquisition.  If any potential acquisition will be a small business set-aside, then FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, applies.  If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small businesses, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort.
 If the Government determines that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, provide details as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 will be achieved, including specifics regarding teaming arrangements, the anticipated percentage of the effort to be subcontracted, and the business size of anticipated subcontractors.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and any previous experience in teaming must be addressed.

7.  Please address the following questions in your response.  Documentation of technical expertise and qualifications must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary capabilities to perform the required services.

7.a.
 Describe your ability to support the scope of the requirement in the draft performance work statement.

7.b.  Identify which of the three primary sites identified (i.e., Naval Support Activity (NSA) Naples, NSA Bahrain, Naval Station Rota) you can support.  State whether or not you can support more than one site simultaneously.

7.c.  The support areas generally encompass program support-related areas (management analysis, information technology support, financial support, etc.) and technical/engineering-related areas (engineering support, quality assurance, integrated test engineering, etc.).  Can you provide program support, technical/engineering support, or both?

7.d.  This effort requires personnel with Secret-level clearance.
 State your ability to comply with this requirement. 

7.e.  What contract type would you recommend to meet this requirement (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity or definitive contract; firm-fixed price, cost-reimbursement, or a hybrid; single award or multiple award)?

7.f.  What additional information do you require to provide a proposal?  Please identify any areas requiring clarity and provide any feedback related to the draft performance work statement and procurement strategy.  Submit any questions you have regarding this RFI/Sources Sought Notice and the draft performance work statement.

Submission 
Responses should be limited to no more than fifteen standard typewritten pages.
 Reponses should reference FDRMC RFI and shall be submitted by e-mail to Danielle Lafferty at Danielle.lafferty@navy.mil by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on 16 October 2019.

Again, this is not a request for proposals.  Respondents will not be notified of any results.  Please note that the information within this RFI/Sources Sought Notice may be updated and/or may change prior to an official solicitation, if any, is issued.

<DESC><p>The Bureau of The Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Administrative Resource Center (ARC) has made a sole source award to ImmixTechnology, Inc. 8444 Westpark Dr Ste 200, McLean, VA 22102-5112 for a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for three years against their GSA Federal Supply Schedule, GS-35F-0265X for Kronos WebTA payroll time and attendance services. This award was pursuant to FAR Part 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>Per market research and confirmed via the Kronos, the Manufacturer of the Kronos WebTA system, ImmixTechnology is the only authorized reseller available through a Best in Class (BIC) resource (a Treasury Mandatory Source). As the required products and services will be providing upgrades to existing software and/or the purchase of new software components of the existing WebTA Platform on a "as needed" basis; only Kronos products/services will be acceptable. Migration to another time and attendance system would require a conversion, testing, implementation, and training effort that would extend for a minimum of twelve (12) months (excluding planning time) and require extensive resources from ARC for deployment and additional cost/time from each customer agency.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of The Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) has made a sole source award to SDAC Facilities Services, LLC., 14510 SW 284th St., Homestead, FL 33033-1632 for a Task Order (TO) for a Base Year plus three 12-month option years against their GSA BMO Contract GS06Q16BQDS119 for Landscaping and Groundskeeping services for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the Liberty Center Building in Washington, D.C. <br />Last year the requirement for O&amp;M was competed and awarded on Task Order 2033H619F00031 under the BMO to SDAC. At the time, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service was unaware that GSA would be turning these landscaping services over to Fiscal Service. This would have fit in the scope of the current O&amp;M award and as Landscaping is such a small percentage of the O&amp;M, it would have had no effect on the competition. In the interest of economy and efficiency, the Government has awarded a logical follow-on to SDAC Facilities Services, LLC. This award was pursuant to FAR Part 16.505 (b)(2)(i)(C), the order must be issued on a sole source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 22, is issuing this special notice to inform industry contractors of the intent to execute a Single Source award as prescribed in FAR 13.106-1(b)(i) with Data Innovations, LLC., 120 Kimball Ave. STE 100. South Burlington, VT 05403.

A sole source with Data Innovations is required to continue normal operations without negatively impacting patient care at the eight (8) facilities within VISN 22.  All facilities will need to evaluate, receive, and validate the new instrument management middleware, JRN, and EP Evaluator software before instrument testing can be run on them.  New instrumentation may be required to meet compatibility of new middleware and software which require consumables and reagents to be exchanged to meet compatibility with new instruments.  Switching middleware manufacturers at this point will hurt normal operations and negatively impact patient care at these eight (8) facilities. At this time, there are no current vendors or FSS contract holders capable of providing the required instrument management middleware, JRN, and EP Evaluator software.  In accordance with FAR Part 13, specifically Subpart 13.106-1(b)(i), there is only one (1) responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. 

This procurement is for Instrument Management Software, JResultNet(JRN) middleware, and EP Evaluator in accordance with FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. The Instrument Management Software, JResultNet(JRN) middleware, and EP Evaluator will provide the necessary support to continue normal operations for all eight facilities.  The Instrument Management Software and JRN will support auto-verification and increase quality. The EP Evaluator system will support instrument and method validation within all laboratory facilities. The support from Instrument Management Software, JResultNet(JRN) middleware, and EP Evaluator will ensure efficient streamlined process at all eight facilities.  

 
Data Innovations, LLC. is a responsible source who has worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs on previous acquisitions. The award date is 10-01-2019. The period of performance is from 10-1-2019 to 09-30-2020. The place of performance is VA San Diego Healthcare System, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, VA Long Beach, VA Loma Linda, VA Albuquerque, VA Prescott, VA Tucson, and VA Phoenix. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 511210.  The Small Business Administration size standard for this sector is $41.5 Million. 

This notice of intent is neither a formal solicitation nor a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No award will be made on the basis of unsolicited quotations or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities no later than 4:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on November 02, 2019.  Interested shall e-mail all statements, quote, and capabilities; the senders bear full responsibility to ensure complete transmission and timely receipt. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing via e-mail to carol.evans3@va.gov with solicitation/notice number 36C26220P0029 referenced in the subject line.

<SUBJECT>LDUUV Large Displacement baseline autonomy evaluation
<SOLNBR>N66604-10-D-0215-N66604-18-F-0915
<RESPDATE>100819
<CONTACT>Keri L. Gunn, Contract Specialist, Phone 4018326779, Email keri.gunn@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a synopsis for a modification to Task Order N66604-18-F-0915 (under basic contract # N66604-10-C-0215) with Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc. (hereafter referred to as "Draper") for noncommercial services prepared in accordance with FAR 5.207 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The purpose of the proposed modification is to increase the tasking under the Statement of Work (SOW) and to extend the associated period of performance.
<p>The objective of Task Order N66604-18-F-0915 is for system engineering analysis, design, and support for Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV) with respect to the autonomous control system; the development of software updates to the Maritime Open Architecture Autonomy (MOAA) framework and UUV simulation environment to accommodate the LDUUV and demonstrate the updated MOAA framework and UUV simulation through simulation scenarios; and to develop software updates to the MOAA framework to support in-water testing on prototype vehicles and demonstrate the updated MOAA framework during in-water test events. The updates will support the Extended Range Modular Undersea Heavyweight Vehicle (ER-MUHV) project requirements.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the Government requires an increase of the tasking in the SOW for the evaluation of the Large Displacement (LD) baseline autonomy with the UMAA evolving standard in order to align with required UMAA standard. This additional effort is required to close out critical design reviews (CDRs) that took place in May 2019. Because of the increase in the tasking described above, the Government also requires an extension of the period of performance under the task order by one year.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services and supplies for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(d) (1)(B)(ii), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) states, "For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-- Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements".</p>
<p>Draper is the only company with the skills and knowledge necessary to meet the Navy's need for support of the ER-MUHV project requirements. Draper has solely provided system engineering analysis, design, and support of LDUUV with respect to the autonomous control system; provided engineering support for the program Integrated Product Teams (IPTs), including participation in weekly meetings; provided informal status updates and responded to program information requests; provided engineering and technical documentation reflecting changes and updates to sustain and advance LDUUV; documented the specification of interfaces between the autonomous controller and the vehicle systems, payloads, and command and control system; defined software requirements, software architecture and design; as well as prepared and provided presentation material for the CDR and performed detailed design for presentation at the CDR for Autonomous Controller (AC) software components, to include : AC to Ashore/Afloat Command and Control (C2) interface, AC to Vehicle Controller (VC) interface, AC IPOE (Internet Protocol Over Ethernet) Behavior Functionality, AC Mission Sequencer Functionality, and AC Obstacle Avoidance functionality. Given the time to compete the additional requirements, coupled with the technical understanding required for another company to meet the Government's system capability and schedule requirements, Draper is the only company that can perform the work.</p>
<p>Delaying the evaluation of LD baseline autonomy with the UMAA evolving standard in order to align with required UMAA standard EMM would result in significant negative impact on the Navy mission. Specifically, the government will be unable to develop and integrate a MOAA-based UUV AC into a testbed variant of the Mk 48 Mod 7 Heavyweight Torpedo to demonstrate improved UUV-like mission capabilities. Due to these considerations, full and open competition for the requirement would result in an unacceptable delay of capability to the Navy. Having such a gap would result in significant negative impact on the Navy mission. Therefore, avoiding the significant negative impact on the Fleet outweighs the potential short term minimal impacts on the addition of SOW tasking and extension of the associated period of performance given the tasking falls under the original Statement of Work scope.</p>
<p>The synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Information shall be submitted prior to 8 October 2019 via email to all of the following points of contact: Keri Gunn at keri.gunn@navy.mil.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael J. Douglass, CPSM, CPSD, Contracting Officer, Email michael.j.douglass@usps.gov
<DESC>Background: The Postal Service constructed a new building, the Worldway Airport Mail Center (AMC) in 1968. In 2009, the facility was renamed LA Worldway International Service Center (ISC) when Carson Long Beach ISC relocated to the LA AMC. The LA ISC is 377,601 square foot, multi-level building constructed and owned by the Postal Service.
<p><br />The LA ISC has direct access to the Los Angeles Airport (LAX) airside operation as well as access to the public. The LA ISC houses mail processing operations on two floors and utilizes automation/mechanization and manual system for processing originating mail for national and international destinations. The Bulk Mail Entry Unit (BMEU) is located onsite.</p>

<CONTACT>Thomas M. Pio, Purchasing & Supply Management Specialist, Email thomas.m.pio@usps.gov - Paige Lyne, Puchasing & Supply Management Specialist, Email jacqueline.p.lyne@usps.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a Security Upgrades project at the Dallas, TX NDC located at 2400 DFW Turnpike (I-30), Dallas, TX. 75398-9100. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,000,000 to $1,600,000 with construction completion within 270 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification/Evaluation Package with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1)Contractors must provide a copy of a General Contractors license as required by the State named in this solicitation, or copy of an application to obtain such license(s) to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation. <br />(2)Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five consecutive years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3)Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4)Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification. An EMR in excess of 1.0 may be grounds for eliminating a firm from further consideration by the evaluation team.<br />(5) Company must submit information for three comparable security upgrade projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification / Evaluation Package will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2 of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON THURSDAY MAY 23, 2019, AT 10:00 A.M. CENTRAL TIME AT THE USPS DALLAS NDC LOCATED AT 2400 DFW TURNPIKE (I-30), DALLAS, TX. 75398-9100. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Thomas Pio, Thomas.M.Pio@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn .P.Lyne@usps.gov or Robert Ramba, Robert.C.Ramba@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon Eastern Time on June 3, 2019.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued. This is a new procurement with no incumbent.
This solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular [FAC 2005-95, effective 19 Jan 2017].
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611, with a small business size standard of $15 million.
The Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is seeking the services of a qualified vendor to obtain technical, analytic, and transaction services support to enable the VA to provide supportive housing to homeless and near homeless individuals, and their families, at the Northern Arizona VA Health Care System, 500 AZ-89, Prescott, AZ.
Please see Attachment 1   Performance Work Statement for project details. 
Evaluation of Offers
Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the government, considering technical capability, past performance, and price. The government will evaluate information based on the procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.106-2   Evaluation of Quotations of Offers using the following evaluation criteria: 
1) Technical Evaluation   The evaluation process will consider whether the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the requirements of the solicitation.
2) Price    The contractor s quote shall include their proposed labor categories, rates and number of hours by task, together with associated delivery dates and sub milestone dates (if any). The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. 
3) Past Performance   The Vendor s quote must include a summary description of at least three but no more than five prior contracts/orders per team member/sub-contractor for projects completed within the last five years with organizations with similar mission and functional domains, and of comparable size, complexity and scope.  These references must also include:
Contract/Order Number, brief description of the project, type of contract, amount of the contract
Contracting Officer s Name and Phone Number, Government agency
Contracting Officer s Representative Name and Phone Number

The contractor must indicate whether they were the prime contractor, sub-contractor or other teaming arrangement. Prime shall indicate which aspect they are directly responsible for of this requirement. 

The Offeror is required to provide references for the above projects.  In the event the company itself does not have relevant past performance, references may be submitted on contracts performed by the Key Personnel of the company.  The VA reserves the right to contact all the references that the Offeror lists.
 
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest.
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

VA reserves the right, at any time, without notice, at its sole and absolute discretion, to: (a) reject any or all responses; (b) extend any deadline set forth in this RFQ; and, (c) terminate the RFQ process, in whole or in part.

2 PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF EUL SITE

2.1 Overview of Solicitation Structure

Through this RFQ, VA is presenting an EUL Site available for redevelopment for an Offeror, EUL Offerors may submit a single response to this RFQ to develop the EUL Site referenced in Attachment A.  See Sections 4 and 5 of this RFQ for required response content and evaluation criteria.  

Location, Background and Description of EUL Site

The intent of this Solicitation is to outline the requirements for selection of a Developer and its team(s) to create a safe, affordable, housing community for homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families at the Dayton VA Medical Center campus.

Supportive housing is a proven, effective means of reintegrating homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families into the community by addressing their basic needs for housing and providing ongoing support services to residents in that housing.  

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Â§8163, VA conducted a Public Hearing on the redevelopment of proposed an EUL for supportive housing and selection of a Developer on July 24, 2019 at 6:00 p.m.

Attachment A contains additional information regarding the location, background information, and description of the subject EUL Site.  Attachment B includes directions on how to participate in the in-person tours of the EUL Site.

Development Considerations

In considering whether to submit a response to develop the EUL Site, the Offeror should consider certain factors.

National Historic Preservation Act

Prior to entering into a EUL with VA, the Offeror shall work with VA to fulfill the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act, 54 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 300101, et seq. ( NHPA ) in conjunction with the development and finalization of the proposed Development Plans.  Section 106 of NHPA, 54 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 306108, requires the consideration of the effects of the Project on historic properties listed or eligible for listing in the National Historic Register and provides representatives of the state and local governments, tribes and other interested consulting parties sufficient opportunity to comment on the Development Plan prior to execution of the EUL.  Section 106 of the NHPA also requires the seeking of ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects (e.g., demolition) that the Development Plan might have on any historic properties during the execution stage of the EUL.  Consummation of this effort will be accomplished by VA. VA will act in concert with the Offeror when necessary in the accomplishment of historical compliance.  For guidelines related to historic preservation requirements, visit https://www.achp.gov/protecting-historic-properties. 

National Environmental Policy Act and Other Environmental Considerations

EUL and the Project will be subject to all applicable Federal, State, and local environmental laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations, including but not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ( CERCLA ), 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9601-9675; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6901, et seq; and the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ), 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4321-4347.Â  NEPA requires that Federal agencies, including VA, identify and evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a major Federal action (e.g., an EUL) on the human environment.Â  VA will complete the NEPA analysis upon VA s selection of the Offeror.Â  The Offeror will be required to provide development-specific information to support the analysis.Â  The NEPA analysis must be completed by VA, prior to execution of the EUL.Â  The Offeror will be responsible for complying with mitigation requirements of the NEPA analysis, if required. Offer shall comply with all applicable environmental laws and will be responsible for any required cleanup/remediation activities.Â  Additionally, the Offeror will be responsible for any necessary environmental studies, reports, sites assessments, seismic, etc. that are needed by Offeror to meet Offeror s obligations.Â  Lastly, the Offeror will be responsible for complying with any regulatory requirements for the abatement and removal of any asbestos and/or lead-containing material. 

Infrastructure

Any available information about infrastructure at the EUL Site is included in Attachment A.  It is the responsibility of the Offeror to pay utility providers for all utilities through separate metering. It is the responsibility of the Offeror to bring in the necessary utility lines (water, sewer, gas, fiber optics, communication, cable, etc.) to operate the EUL. VA is not obligated to provide selected Offeror access to VA owned utilities or resources. 

Legal Considerations

Overview 

The Offeror is responsible for conducting its own due diligence regarding the EUL Site including, without limitation, whether (a) the development of the EUL Site, as contemplated by the Response, can be accomplished in compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local requirements (including fire, life safety, accessibility, zoning, State and local building codes, and other local land use restrictions); (b) the condition of the EUL Site is suitable for the Offeror s contemplated use; (c) the necessary permits, variances, special exceptions and other governmental actions or approvals required for the contemplated developments can be reasonably obtained (at no cost or expense to VA); and (d) the contemplated use(s) is otherwise practical and economically feasible. Property is under concurrent jurisdiction. Prior to the execution of the lease agreement, Offeror will need to have written executed agreements (e.g., Memorandum of Understanding regarding fire, police, and emergency services) in place and includes VA concurrence. 

Taxes

In accordance with the pertinent provisions of the EUL Statute (i.e., 38 U.S.C. Â§ 8167), the Offeror during the EUL term will be subject to any and all applicable State and local taxes, fees, assessments, and special assessments legally chargeable to the EUL, the Offeror s leasehold interest, and the Offeror s underlying improvements.  However, neither VA s interest in the EUL nor the United States  fee interest in the underlying properties shall be subject, directly or indirectly, to any State or local laws relative to taxation, fees, assessments or special assessments.

Security

Offeror is responsible for providing security on the EUL site. The Offeror shall include in their response an overview of the physical security and electronic monitoring that will be provided based upon the individual space requirements and tenant mix of the proposed EUL Project. As part of the response, it should be noted, that it is the requirement of the Offeror to have security 24/7.

Energy Conservation and Sustainable Design Requirements

The VA Sustainable Design Manual (<http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/sustain.asp>) is the guidance that defines the methodology to incorporate sustainable design, including energy efficiency, in the EUL project. VA encourages Offerors to incorporate sustainability over and above the standards found in the current VA Sustainable Design Manual. In previous projects, some developers have proposed more aggressive energy efficiency and sustainability milestones that made their proposals, all other elements considered equal, more attractive.Â  To take advantage of existing sustainability work in the private sector that is well accepted in the construction industry, VA has determined that using a third-party rating system is the best method for fulfilling VA sustainable building requirements in the EUL project. The Offeror may propose using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDÂ®) rating system, the Green GlobesÂ® rating system, or an alternate rating system. VA requires that the project achieve at least LEED Silver, Two Green Globes, or an equivalent certification level by the alternate rating organization. Offerors proposing to use an alternate rating system must submit a memo to the VA Project Manager demonstrating that the alternate solution achieves an equivalent level of certification as LEED Silver, Two Green Globes, or both.

Prevailing Wages

Unless the Offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of VA in the form of a written determination or written correspondence from the U.S. Department of Labor that the Offeror or the Project are exempt therefrom, Offeror shall comply with the requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act, as amended, 40 U.S.C. Â§ 3141, et seq. and the relevant rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor applicable thereto.

Handicap Accessibility

The Offeror will be required to ensure that its design, development, construction, operation, and maintenance plan and activities on the EUL Site comply in all respects with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 12101, et seq., and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4151, et seq., as amended.

EUL Statutory Requirements

VA s EUL and statutory requirements are codified at 38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 8161-8169 and as amended. 

EUL Site, VA s Goals and Objectives

VA has the following goals and objectives for the Projects:

Reuse underutilized VA properties to create safe, affordable, smoke-free housing for Veterans and their families (including Women and their children) and should have priority placement in any housing project created on the EUL Site.

Provide supportive housing and on-site supportive/resident services (if HUD-VASH is used, the service provider must provide service above and beyond HUD-VASH requirement). It is the intent that VA will provide case management services to eligible Veterans. 

Develop a housing model geared towards enabling Veterans to achieve self-sufficiency and live independently.  

Avoid ongoing operating costs associated with the upkeep of vacant and/or underutilized assets.

Other Considerations

VA will not participate in or allow its or the United States  underlying fee interest in the land to be used as security for financing for the Project or otherwise, including without limitation, providing any kind of guaranty or act in any way as a beneficiary for a financing vehicle.

In regard to any proposed Project-related financing to be obtained by the Offeror, VA as a general rule will not approve any financing that includes requirements that operate to deny, restrict, or subordinate VA s right to terminate the EUL upon the Offeror s failure to cure an outstanding event of default thereunder.  This includes any document, to include the EUL that would prevent VA from terminating the EUL due to  cross default  arising from one or more parcels on the Property.  Any proposed Project financing that does not comply with this restriction must be explicitly identified in the RFQ response for VA s unilateral review and evaluation. The successful Offeror must establish and maintain positive relations and communications with State and local governmental authorities and the local communities during negotiations with VA and any of its representatives.

The successful Offeror must integrate development activities with cultural resources and historical and environmental policy management requirements in support of VA s mission and operations.

The Offeror will be responsible for coordinating the work schedule(s) with VA in order to minimize disruption to the campus  activities and operations. This coordination includes the work of any contractor or subcontractor that the Offeror retain in connection with the Project.

CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN OUTLINE

Following its selection, the Offeror will be responsible for preparing a detailed Development Plan for the Project.  The Development Plan must contain a description of the Project and address comprehensively all significant issues regarding its development, operation, management, and maintenance.  The Development Plan must include, but should not be limited to, the following:

ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS: 

Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made based on the best overall quote that is determined to be the overall best value to the government. Pursuant to FAR 52.212-2, the criteria for evaluation is: : (I) Technical Acceptability (II) Price.

Factor 1: Technical Acceptability   The Government will evaluate the responses provided to Attachment 1, List of Requirements.Â  If an offeror marks  no  to a minimum of one (1) requirement listed therein, the offeror s quote will be excluded from further evaluation and no longer considered for award. The technical rating is on the below:

 Table A Technical Ratings
Rating
Description
Acceptable
The technical volume clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. (All responses to Attachment 1, List of Requirements, are marked  yes )
Unacceptable
The technical volume does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. (If an offeror marks  no  to a minimum of one (1) requirement listed therein)

Factor 2: Price   Initially quotes shall be ranked according to price, including option prices.  The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to make a price reasonableness determination. Offers that do not receive a technical rating of  acceptable  shall not be selected for award, regardless of price.

Consequently, contractors are highly encouraged to quote their best pricing quotes in their initial submissions. However, the Government reserves the right to communicate with any or all contractors submitting a quote, if it is determined advantageous to the Government to do so. If these communications take place, the Government is not obligated to communicate with every contractor (note that FAR Part 15 procedures do not apply; therefore, formal discussions are not applicable). All contractors will be treated fairly and impartially. A contractor may be eliminated from consideration without further communication if its pricing quotes are not among those contractors considered most advantageous to the Government based on a best value determination.
 
All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the review in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first sort the quotes of all Offerors by price from lowest price to the highest.  Thereafter, the Government will review the capability of the lowest priced quote only.  If the lowest priced Offeror s capability is determined to be acceptable and meets the requirements, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further reviews of the remaining Offerors  capability.  If the lowest priced Offeror s capability is determined to not meet the requirement, then the Government may review the capability next lowest priced quote, and so forth and so on, until the Government reaches a quote that is determined to meet the capability requirements.

Quotes that merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement shall be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor quoting the lowest price, or to the contractor with the most highly technical quote.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide question and answers from interested vendors and provide site visit for interested vendors. Please see attached. The solicitation due date is extended to 10 October 2019 at 12:00 PM EST.

The SOW states that Building 100 has an existing DirecTV system that is standard definition.  Are all the TV s at this location Pro-Idioms? NO

You say you have 275 drops and want to change over to HD capable.  What receivers do you currently have in your HD system and what modulators are you using? None of our equipment will supply HD so we need to upgrade.

Regarding the new Fisher House buildings, you say you want 16 drops.  If so, do you envision a head end system at each new building?  How many receivers at the head end of each building? 

There is 17 locations in Fisher House 1 but 18 locations in Fisher House 2.  I would also like to add that the TVs have been installed in both Fisher Houses already and there are coaxial lines running from each TV location back to the data closet in each house, but those lines have not been terminated.  Therefore, you would need to install a head end in each Fisher House, terminate the 35 lines, plug them into your head end, then install receivers in the 35 locations



Could you please provide the requested channel lineup including the number channels that are required?
Local Channels 2,4,5,7,9,11,13,21  (Channel 12  local chapel) 
Yes Network, SNY, Military Channel, and Chapel Channel if available


Can you tell me if you have H25 receivers now, or do you have the older D12's? We have D12 s

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Safety Lancets, Pediatric. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Safety Lancets, Pediatric products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil">https://www.medical.dla.mil</a>.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Safety Lancets, Pediatric in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Safety Lancets, Pediatric will be established approximately 12 January 2020 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately 12 February&nbsp;2020, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Safety Lancets, Pediatric. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Safety Lancets, Pediatric.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Safety Lancets, Pediatric. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $234,665.99. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. One item is required for addition to the QSL and accounts for 90.2 % ($211,582.53) of the total volume in sales ($234,665.99). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 4:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample. Vendor must send the same part number(s) for evaluation(s) as provided in response to this QSL FBO announcement and as noted in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />5.1 LANCET DEVICE HEEL, BLADE, 1.0 MM INCISION DEPTH X 2.50 MM INCISION WIDTH / 172,250 /<br /><br />6.

<DESC>Background: The Postal Service constructed a new building, the Worldway Airport Mail Center (AMC) in 1968. In 2009, the facility was renamed LA Worldway International Service Center (ISC) when Carson Long Beach ISC relocated to the LA AMC.

<p><br />The LA ISC has direct access to the Los Angeles Airport (LAX) airside operation as well as access to the public. The LA ISC houses mail processing operations on two floors and utilizes automation/mechanization and manual system for processing originating mail for national and international destinations. The Bulk Mail Entry Unit (BMEU) is located onsite.</p>
<p>The purpose of this purchase is&nbsp;to construct a 602,000 square foot expansion at the Los Angeles Processing and Distribution Center in order to relocate and consolidate the LA ISC functions to the LA P&amp;DC at 7001 S Central Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90052.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p><br />2. Attachment A4 - NASA Capabilities: Minor edits to Center title pages only.</p>

<p>&bull; Amended the language of 1852.204-75 SECURITY CLASSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (SEP 1989) to reflect the fact that DD254 is now incorporated into the solicitation as Attachment L.</p>
<p>&bull; Amended MSFC 52.216-90 IDIQ CONTRACT VALUE BY PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE (MAY 2017) to change the Period of Performance on the Base Contract and Option A Listed from "TBP" to "10 Months" and "4 Years," respectively.</p>
<p>&bull; Amended MSFC 52.216-92 MATRIX OF CONTRACT LINE ITEMS (CLINs) (OCT 2017) to change the value on Option A CLINs from being indicated as "TBP" to "$TBP*," and added asterisk wording below the table to state, "*See Section 5.2.6.1 of Broad Agency Announcement NNH19ZCQ001K_APPENDIX-H-HLS for information on option exercise."</p>
<p>6. Attachment F - Requirements: Corrected Objective 009 in HLS-RQMT-001.</p>
<p>7. Attachment G - Statement of Work: Minor formatting edits only.</p>
<p>8. Attachment I - GFE/GFP List: Minor edits to the first tab to synchronize with referenced requirements.</p>
<p>9. Attachment L - DD Form 254: Added.</p>
<p>10. Attachment Q - GTA Template: Significant clarifications and revisions. Removed the Letter of Intent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Due to the updates the attachment list is as follows:</p>
<p><br />A Reference Library<br />01 HLS Concept of Operations<br />02 Referenced standards and documents<br />03 Interoperability standards<br />04 NASA Capabilities<br />05 Orion Parameters for HLS Mission Design<br />06 Physical Capabilities and Characteristics<br />07 Gateway-Exploration Systems Development (ESD)-Surface Suit Quad Charts<br />08 HLS Communications Information<br />09 Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Services for Commercial Proposals<br />10 Elliptical Polar Orbit<br />11 Global Access White Paper<br />12 HLS Design Analysis Cycle 2 (DAC2) Architecture Analyses of Alternatives<br />13 Net Habitable Volume and Internal Layout Considerations<br />14 Surface Mission Duration Sensitivity<br />15 Reserved<br />16 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) Reference Trajectory<br />17 Manual Control Systems<br />18 Development of HLS Preliminary Hazards List<br />19 Rocket Propulsion Test Capability<br />20 Lunar Landing Site Characterization<br />21 NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) 14 Final Report<br />22 Launch Availability and Quiescence<br />B NASA Points of Contact<br />C Quad Chart Template<br />D Corporate Contribution Worksheet<br />E Model Contract<br />F HLS Requirements<br />G Statement of Work (SOW)<br />H Data Procurement Document (List of Data Requirement Deliverables (DRDs))<br />I Government Furnished Equipment/Property (GFE/GFP) List<br />J Design and Performance Metrics Tables<br />K Optional GFE/GFP Agreement Template<br />L DD Form 254<br />M Reserved<br />N Reserved<br />O Milestone Acceptance Criteria and Payment Schedule<br />P Pricing Template<br />Q Government Task Agreement Template</p>

The selected firms must have the capability using in-house staff or consultants to provide timely and cost effective responses to support the Military Design and Construction Program to include but not limited to: engineering studies, investigations, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, drawing reviews, renovation/repair projects, such as, building renovations and additions, new construction, master and sub-area development planning, preparation of project definition and programming documents, charrettes, preparation of the technical portions of design-build solicitations, value engineering studies, environmental permit applications, facility condition assessments, and the development of construction plans and specifications for new vertical construction projects. Mobile District's Military Design and Construction Program supports various stakeholders to include the Army, Air Force, Navy, Special Operations Command, Defense Health Programs and other DoD programs and agencies. Mobile District requires multiple contracting resources to provide support for its diverse range of stakeholders.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the work will be on military installations, however work may also include a variety of projects under the Interagency/International Services (IIS) program. The selected firm must have the capability using in-house staff or consultants to perform surveying and mapping, geotechnical and subsurface utility investigations, and hazardous material testing and abatement and remediation planning. Design drawings shall be produced in the AutoCAD, Autodesk Revit Building Information Modeling (BIM), Bentley BIM, or MicroStation format. The format will be specific to each project and will be specified in the AE scope of work for the specific project. If BIM is required for a specific project, all BIM models shall be delivered in their proprietary format along with exported IFC models, and 2D CAD drawings (construction documents). Technical specifications will be produced with SPECSINTACT software using Unified Facilities Guide Specifications. Responses to design review comments will be provided using the Government web-based Design Review and Checking System (DrChecks) located at www.projnet.org. The work will primarily be located in with Mobile District Area of Responsibility (AOR) and other locations that may be assigned to the Mobile District.</p>
<p>SELECTION CRITERIA: The source selection factors for this procurement are listed below in descending order of importance. Factors 1 through 6 are primary. Factor 7 is secondary and will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. Primary factors will be assigned a rating from "outstanding" to "unsatisfactory", based on the risk to the Government that the Offeror will successfully perform that evaluated factor. An overall rating will also be applied to the proposal submission using the same rating scale. Proposals failing to respond or provide complete information for each factor as required by this solicitation will be determined non-compliant and will be removed from further consideration. After all ratings have been assigned, Offerors will be ranked as "Most Highly Qualified", "Highly Qualified", and "Not Qualified" in accordance with EP 715-1-7 Architect-Engineer Contracting In USACE.</p>
<p>For purposes of this solicitation, a stand-alone contract or single task order is considered one project. Separating activities performed under a contract or task order will not be considered multiple projects; conversely, combining activities performed under separate contracts or task orders to produce a single project will not be considered. A single task under an Indefinite Delivery Contract is considered a project, not an Indefinite Delivery Contract itself. Projects in which the AE Service is not 100% complete will not be evaluated.</p>

MPI is critical technology that is used to maintain and support various equipment throughout the Air Force. Typical MPI units consist of an induction coil, a tank to hold suspension and particles, and a booth with a hood to remove light. MPI works by either directly or indirectly magnetizing a material. Magnetic particles in either dry or wet suspension are then applied to the magnetized material. If the material has a surface or subsurface discontinuity magnetic flux will be leaked. Magnetic particles will be attracted to the flux leakage indicating the discontinuity to the user.</span></p>

The SPRS User's Manual provides information concerning vendor scoring, negative &amp; positive performance data utilized to calculate vendor scores, and the process in which to challenge discrepant performance data. The SPRS site has a number of user manuals found at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/reference.htm.

Demolish/dispose of existing facilities and abandoned infrastructure, complete all new site work and site utilities.  Utility work will be coordinated with local providers.  Historical preservation requirements will be adhered to by the contractor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The</span><strong style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"> </strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">purchase order is required to allow for continued support as Image Associates has the resources already in place to prevent any disruption of services and to avoid any unforeseen complications. The required services are available only from the incumbent, Image Associates, for the continued provision of services as it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the government which is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs. Moreover, with another contractor, it would take 15 days to transition over, with up to 8 weeks for employee background checks and badging requirements. Conducting a limited competition among possible quoters and awarding a bridge contract to any other contractor other than Image Associates for the period of October 2, 2019 through January 12, 2020 presents significant challenges which would cripple the NIEHS's mission. Conducting any limited competition and transitioning to a new contractor would not be practicable given the limited time based on the October 2, 2019 need date. Implementing a new standalone contract with any firm other than Image Associates will cause duplication of costs associated with transitioning to a new contractor. Based on the transition time and added costs, only the incumbent, Image Associates, can meet the requirements for the bridge contract services required under this contract, discontinued use would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and will result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</span></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to the following questions:

1. Material is Al/Steel/ TI: How we can quote for all 3 material same? Are we supposed to put different price sheet for all 3 material?
Answer: The vendor price quote should be based upon the heat treatment process as defined in the SOW and not the specific composition of the material.

2.  Form or drawing needed: This will be needed to quote. Is it a bar, plate etc.?

Answer: The Government may include drawing in the orders, but due to the proprietary data not all drawing can be provided.  The bassis for individual orders will be on the item weight and  treatment process as defined in the SOW

3. Can you provide a sample drawing with material information? Just in case customer is looking an estimate only.
  
 
Answer:  Sample drawing will not be provided in the solicitation. The customer will not also ask for estimate; there is no reason to ask for this if there is a contract in place. If our concern is how much is left in the contract then we will base this on the weights used (limits defined by CLIN 001  and  002).

<DESC>This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, but merely notification of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) intent to issue, on a sole-source basis, a firm fixed-price purchase order to Cybrary, Inc for "Cybrary for Government" computer-based, Security Enablement training through an array of resources that test the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities of the learner.

<p>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1, the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Cybrary training is only available from its producer and manufacturer and not through dealers or distributors. The period of performance will be for a one-year beginning October 15, 2019 through October 14, 2020.</p>
<p>This requirement is utilizing procedures in FAR Part 13. A determination by SSA not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of SSA. Information received will be considered for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this notice.</p>
<p>Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. Responses shall be submitted by 9:00AM ET on Wednesday, October 9, 2019 to Lindsay.Hrybyk@ssa.gov . If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement by October 9, 2019, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Cybrary, Inc. as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. Respondents should refer to 1586-20-1001 in their responses.</p>

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>GSA Solicitation No. 47PJ0019R0203</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>CMc Services - IRS Service Center Limited Scope Modernization</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>IRS Service Center, 1160 W 1200 Street, Ogden, UT 84404-5402</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Project Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Region 8 requires Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) (also known as construction manager at risk) services for the repairs, alterations, renovations, and improvements at the Department of Treasury - Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Service Center Building located at 1160 W 1200 S, Ogden, UT. GSA has determined that the proposed repair and alteration project is the best solution for GSA and IRS in order to address critical needs, reduce future maintenance, improve life safety and efficiency, and minimize repair costs.<br /><br /></div>
<div>The building was originally constructed in 1965-1966. It consisted of the South Building, including all areas south of the Central Atrium and the Administrative Area. In 1968-1969, the North Building was constructed along with the Mechanical Room extensions and the enclosed south dock and warehouse spaces. The following year the Health Center was completed. The area known as "Caf&eacute; West" and the exterior playground area were built in 1989-1990. The main entrance at Door "A" and the "Public Access entrance at Door "K" were added in 1992-1993. In 1994-1995, changes were made which extended the perimeter fence, added the north dock and mechanical room, constructed the west visitor security building and installed security access shelters at the drive entrances. The latest renovation in 2000 involved upgrading the Child Care Center. The Main Building and property is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The IRS Service Center is one of three mission critical facilities for the IRS, and is operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The building also houses an American First Federal Credit Union branch, Cafeteria Services and a Child Care Center.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The CMc approach will require partnering with the GSA, A-E, IRS, and other involved parties. The CMc contract will include three key phases or categories of work: Pre Construction Services, Construction Services, and Construction Management Services.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The CMc delivery method will allow full collaboration between the CMc contractor and the design contractor throughout the design process. Pre Construction Services for the CMc will include the review of the IRS work item list and to help the architect/engineer (A/E), IRS and GSA prioritize these work items, and to allow the construction budget to maximize the number building improvements completed. The CMc will provide constructability reviews and cost estimating during this phase.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In broad terms the Construction Services for this contract will include: general architectural construction (walls, ceilings, finishes), electrical upgrades, mechanical upgrades, fire and life safety upgrades, seismic bracing, roof replacement and paving upgrades. The details of the work items and construction scope will be defined based on the 100% construction documents, drawings and specifications. The CMc and Government will need to negotiate the scope of Construction Services to maximize the amount of repairs and modernizations that can be accomplished with the available funding.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Construction Management Services during construction will be performed by the CMc contractor. This will include but not be limited to: quality control, budget and schedule management, change order review, commissioning assistance, punch list and closeout assistance. There will not be a construction manager advisor (CMa) on the project.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The documents attached to this solicitation announcement should be referenced for a more detailed description of the requirements, performance objectives, work items, and scope of work.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Project Duration and Schedule:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>GSA anticipates that the design phase will take one year, followed by a two year construction period. Fast tracking some of the work items will be encouraged, taking full advantage of having the CMc contractor on board during the early design phase.  The performance of pre construction services is necessarily connected to the schedule set by the architect-engineer. The performance of construction services and construction management services has more flexibility and may be negotiated to set a schedule that maximizes the amount of repairs and modernizations within the available budget.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Anticipated Dates for Procurement of Project</strong><br />Issue of Solicitation: September 5, 2019<br />Proposals Due: October 7, 2019 no later than 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time<br />Negotiations and Discussions (if necessary): October 2019 / November 2019<br />Contract Award: November 2019<br />Start of Pre Construction Services: November 2019<br />Start of Construction Work and Construction Management Services: September 2020 / October 2020<br />Projected Project Completion: September 2022 / October 2022<br /><br /></div>

<div><br /><strong>NAICS</strong>:  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $39.5 million.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Subcontracting</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with FAR subpart 19.702(a)(1), a subcontracting plan is required as part of the negotiated agreement for the project opportunity. Failure to submit a subcontracting plan may result in ineligibility for contract award. The requirements of a subcontracting plan are described in FAR subpart 19.704. A subcontracting plan is only required to be submitted from the apparent successful offeror as part of the negotiation process, provided the apparent successful offeror is a large business.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Set-Aside</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of market research, the Government has made the decision to solicit the requirement through full and open competition</div>
<div><br /><strong>Contract Type</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The base contract for pre construction services is anticipated to be awarded at a firm-fixed price. The initial contract award will also include a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Construction Cost and proposed Construction Fee Percentage. The GMP Construction Cost includes i) the target Estimated Cost of the Work (ECW); ii) Fee for the Construction Work; and iii) Construction Management Services.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The ECW is set by the Government at $30 million - $40 million for the project. The Government will hold any available contingency allowance.  Offerors are to submit a proposed ECW to be incorporated at construction contract award as the target ECW. The target ECW may adjust based on pre construction services to negotiate a final ECW prior to exercise of the option for Construction Services and Construction Management Services.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Fee for the Construction Work includes the CMc's indirect cost, including overhead and profit for construction services. The Fee for the Construction Work may only adjust for scope changes that have an impact on schedule.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Construction Management Services includes, but is not limited to, any indirect cost, profit, quality control, quality assurance, budget and schedule management, change order review, commissioning assistance, and punch list and closeout assistance for construction management services. Construction Management Services also includes any direct costs incurred in the performance of the services.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>After the parties have agreed to the scope at 100% completed design, the Government and the CMc may agree to bilaterally modify the line item for Construction Services and Construction Management Services from the GMP to a firm-fixed price. The firm-fixed price for Construction Services and Construction Management Services must not be in excess of the GMP.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Construction Services and Construction Management Services are only required if the Government elects to exercise the option. The Government reserves the right not to exercise the option for Construction Services and Construction Management Services if the GMP Construction Costs exceeds the available funding, there is no agreement on the scope of final negotiated ECW, or if it is not in the Government's best interest.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Certain activities may be identified for fast track completion (e.g. demolition as an early work package) to deliver the project quicker than alternative methods of project delivery. Early work packages must be converted to a firm-fixed price through bilateral agreement once the scope of the work package is fully specified.<br /><br /></div>
<div><strong>Bonding</strong>: Contractors will be required to provide a bid bond for the requirement and have sufficient bonding capacity for the proposed work.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Design Errors and Omissions</strong>:  Settled through GSAM 552.243-71 Equitable Adjustments clause and may be settled as firm fixed-price outside of the GMP.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Information on Proposal Submission</strong>:&nbsp;The Government plans to conduct a competitive negotiated acquisition. The Government will use source selection procedures in FAR Part 15 to evaluate proposal packages. Specifically, the Government will evaluate proposals to create a competitive range of the most highly qualified contractors to further discuss qualifications. Accordingly, the Government intends to establish a competitive range to conduct negotiations with the most highly qualified contractors. The competitive range may exclude highly rated proposals that may otherwise be included in the competitive range if it is necessary to achieve efficiency in competition among the most highly rated proposals. The Government may establish a competitive range of one provided such a decision is reasonably supported as part of the competitive range determination. Therefore, offerors are strongly encouraged to submit a proposal that presents the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Interested offerors should carefully read all attached documents and solicitation information for a complete description of the proposal information and requirements. The Government intends to award one (1) contract that represents the best value based on evaluations of past performance, technical factors, other specified non-price factors, and price through a tradeoff process and other procedures described in the solicitation. In the Government's evaluation of proposals, the non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The proposal will consist of two separate volumes or sections.<br />1.	Technical Proposal<br />2.	Price Proposal<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The required content for each volume of the proposal is described in more detail in the documents attached to this solicitation announcement.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Government intends to evaluate four technical factors described below and weight the factors to calculate an overall weighted score for the technical proposal.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Non-Price Factors</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Weight</strong><br />Company's Relevant Experience&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20%<br />Company's Past Performance&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;40%<br />Relevant Experience of Key Personnel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20%<br />Management Approach &amp; Technical Understanding&nbsp; &nbsp; 20%<br /><strong>TOTAL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>100%</div>

These services are specialized laboratory services needed to support the whole genome and metagenomics sequencing project requiring specialized DNA sequencing, instrumentation and bioinformatics analysis not available at the Brooke Army Medical Center. The specialized NxSeq AmpFREE library construction method will be utilized to construct a fragmented DNA library from fifteen (15) to twenty (20) of ninety-six (96) well plates of either amplicon libraries and/or whole-genome shotgun libraries or both. Illumina&rsquo;s Nextera XT kit will work with both library preparatory methodologies. Vendors must be &ldquo;Propel Certified Service Providers&rdquo; to construct Nx Seq AmpFree libraries utilizing the customized Illumina Nextera XT Library preparation kit method where input DNA is not limiting. In-house instrumentation will be used to assess Library quality prior to loading on the sequencer, resulting in more accurate sequencer loading and run performance so as to ensure expected products are generated. Illumina&rsquo;s Nextera XT kit may allow users to load the libraries including a final quality check, to produce consistent sequencing results from run to run. NxSeq AmpFree Library preparation kit is considerably a less expensive process method, but is highlighted as a high priority in meeting the DHA requirement. The data library quality evaluation process is a requirement to support pending patent application and further product development. Samples are to ensure the successful completion of Defense Health Agency, Research Development, Test and Evaluation funded research projects. Results generated from these services may lead to several presentations, publications and possibly new technology developed to support patient care and the warfighter. This requirement is vital to obtain validation data to further develop research studies and ultimately, the aim is to improve military and global health through personalized diagnostics and lower healthcare expenditures consistent with the vision and mission of Army Medicine. </span></p>

Answer:  Provide information to the best of your knowledge.

RFI # 16
Question:  With regard to fulfilling the Past Performance reporting, We will have at least 1 project for which a CPARS assessment is due to be filed; however, the item will not be available to us before the submission due date.Â  Would a PPQ be an acceptable substitute?Â Â Â

RFI #19
Question:  With regard to the required matrix of Key Personnel information:Â Â Â  
Would you like that to be placed before or after Section EÂ  (within Tab 4), or will you be looking for it to be in Section H (within Tab 6)?
We discovered this past Spring that this matrix quickly becomes quite large with minimum 12 pt type (even when using a condensed font).Â  May we submit this sideways on the page (in landscape page orientation)? If we must submit it on the page in portrait orientation, may we break the table across at least 2 pages? May we submit it on an 11 x 17 sheet? Do you have a different preference as to how this is submitted?
Answer:  Landscape orientation is acceptable.Â  

RFI # 20

Question:  Does the  offeror  pertain to only the firm listed as Prime? Or does the  offeror  pertain to the whole group submitting. We would like to know if our consultant s project experience can be listed in this section, specifically a project page in Section F.
Answer:  The Offeror is considered the prime for the purposes of this contract.

<DESC>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-3(d) only requires the agency to furnish a supplier a brief explanation of the basis for the contract award decision, not an actual "debriefing" as would be required under FAR 15.506. Since award was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the contract award decision is provided herein: Although technical capability and past performance factors were of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, price was also important to the overall contract award decision. The Government considered that all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, were significantly more important than price.  Furthermore, the RFQ stated that, "The Government will not award a contract to any Quoter with an unacceptable rating or a deficiency in ANY factor or subfactor" and that, "A Quoter must receive an adjectival rating of acceptable or above for each sub factor. Failure to meet the criteria will render the response not eligible for award'. The Government utilized a tradeoff approach to determine the Quoter who provided the best value to the Government. The quote submitted by Praxair Distribution, Incorporated in response to the RFQ provided the best overall value to satisfy the Government's needs.

<DESC>This acquisition provides Conexus Plexus Vision Information System (IS) at current installation locations throughout the Patient Movement (PM) network wherein the system is referred to as the Patient Movement Item - Asset Tracking System, and to assist/advise the Government on additional requirements needed for the expansion of the PMI-ATS and associated activities. PMI-ATS is currently installed and manages the PMI throughout the PM network. This system is used daily to report the current location and historical movement of the staged &amp; mobile medical equipment and supplies assigned to the PMI program. Users are able to access and extract information from the systems data repository to reflect the trajectory of the equipment as it moves as well as item location at any given time. The tracking system is vital to ensuring mission critical PMI assets are ready, staged and available for use in treating ill or injured patients.

FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C250-19-AP-4639  

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10, Ann Arbor VA Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The requesting activity has submitted VA Form 2237 No. 506-20-1-1527-0001.  

Description of Action: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 251 and 40 U.S.C. 501).  
Order against:     VA/DLA Contract Number: VA797H-17-D-0022
Name of Proposed Contractor:
Philips Healthcare, A Division of PENAC
Street Address:
22100 Bothell Everett Highway
City, State, Zip:
Bothell, WA 98021
Phone:
(425) 908-2053
Description of Supplies or Services:
The estimated value of the proposed action is $673,119.24
The services required to meet the Agency s needs are a comprehensive maintenance and repair plan for Philips Healthcare manufactured equipment located at the Ann Arbor VA Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.  This maintenance and repair plan shall include regular preventative maintenance and emergency repairs during normal working hours in order to maintain the system at the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) specifications.  The period of performance shall be October 1, 2019   September 30, 2020.   
 (4) IDENTIFY THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (C) or 8.405-6(b)), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

 An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

 Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; 

The equipment must be serviced by the OEM due to proprietary operating software, hardware, and parts that are only available from Philips Healthcare.  The service could not be provided by a source other than Philips Healthcare to ensure the system is functioning to OEM standards.  The DLA awarded this contract specifically for the maintenance and repair of high-technology medical equipment within the VA.  This contract was competed and Philips Healthcare was the only respondent for these specific Philips-manufactured machines.  

 In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

 Items peculiar to one manufacturer: 

 A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.) 

 These are  direct replacements  parts/components for existing equipment.  

 The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
This vendor is the manufacturer of the specialized medical equipment and it contains proprietary hardware and software.  In order to sustain the integrity of the equipment, it is in the best interest of the Government to award to this contractor.  


(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research was conducted.  A search on VetBiz under NAICS code 811219 and keyword  Philips  yielded 3 results, but none of the sources listed have access to OEM proprietary software keys.  The original awarded contract was competitively awarded by DLA and Philips Healthcare was the only respondent for these specific Philips-manufactured machines.  

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.  




(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor s supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)

<p>This limited sources justification supports a new order to purchase Knoll furniture for the AWC and NWS Central Region Headquarters, located in the NWS Training Center building in Kansas City, MO. Knoll, Inc. is the only source with the capability to match furniture decor with the existing NWS and AWC Knoll furniture, in order to maintain color uniformity, compatibility, form/fit and function. A firm-fixed price delivery order was issued against Knoll, Inc. GSA Schedule GS-03F-078DA.</p>
<p><br />Only one source under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) - This supplemental purchase from Knoll, Inc. will provide compatibility with existing products for reconfiguration purposes,while ensuring continuation of existing and new warranties. All Knoll systems furniture is the same series and can be interchangeable within the three National Weather Service building's offices. Knoll furniture is the same configuration and compatibility as all finishes (fabrics, paints, laminates, veneers, etc.) are the same and coordinate with existing finishes. Previous actions awarded include WC133W17NC0302 and 1331L518FNWWX0117, whereby a single vendor concept to provide standardization of office products throughout has ensured compatibility, maintained aesthetics, extended warranties, and reduced costs.</p>
<p>This action will complete all furniture requirements for the previously identified line offices located in Kansas City, MO. No further requirements to purchase furniture from Knoll, Inc. are expected. Should they become necessary, configuration interchangeability of parts will be of the utmost concern. If necessary, the agency will provide all related schedule holders an opportunity to provide a capability statement indicating they can meet the requirement.</p>
