<DESC><p>DRAFT request for proposal (DRAFT RFP) Number: FA8003-19-R-A006<br />Notice Type: Pre-Solicitation Notice</p>
<p>Title: AFICC Roofing Repair, Replacement, and Maintenance (R3M)</p>
<p>THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT ON A DRAFT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (DRAFT RFP)/SOLICITATION. <br /><br />PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ATTACHMENT IS A DRAFT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) ONLY. This acquisition is for a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (MAC IDIQ) for R3M to provide all personnel, labor, equipment, supplies, tools, materials, supervision, travel, periodic inspection, minor repair, and other items and services necessary to acquire commercial roof replacement, preventative maintenance, corrective repair, and inspection/testing services for United States Air Force (USAF) U.S. Army (USA) and U.S. Navy (USN) Active, Guard and Reserve installations within the Contiguous United States (CONUS) including Alaska (CONUS+AK) (only areas reachable by ground transportation). The program will acquire such construction and services for existing USAF facilities on a recurring basis. The program may acquire such services for USA and USN on an as-requested basis for requirements of the same scope and the program team has determined there is adequate capacity remaining in the contract ceiling to do so. This contract will be under a mandatory use policy for Active USAF installations, with limited exemptions, to be issued after award by the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC).</p>
<p>The proposed contract shall be a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), MAC IDIQ with a period of performance of one five (5) year ordering period. The Government intends to issue a single solicitation and award a MAC IDIQ to all qualified technically acceptable vendors. Contract award is expected in May 2020. Task Orders will be competed using the Ordering Procedures found in the RFP's Section H clause.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be accomplished in accordance with The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) memorandum, dated December 13, 2017, Class Deviation 2018-O0006 - Evaluation Factors for Certain Multiple-Award Task- or Delivery- Order Contracts, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision. The factor to be evaluated is Technical.</p>
<p>The Government intends for a 100% small business set-aside with the intent to reserve at least two (2) 8(a) IDIQ awards for each region. The Government anticipates awarding Regional MAC IDIQ awards. No vendor is allowed to propose on more than two (2) regions. The regions are:</p>
<p>Region 1: West; Covers installations in California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Region 2: Midwest; Covers installations in Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska North Dakota, Missouri, and South Dakota.</p>
<p>Region 3: Northeast; Covers installations in Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Virginia.</p>
<p>Region 4: Southwest; Covers installations in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.</p>
<p>Region 5: Southeast; Covers installations in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Region 6: Alaska; Covers installations in Alaska.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this solicitation is 238160, Roofing Contractors. The business size standard in dollars is $14.5M. <br />The result of this future evaluation will be to award contracts to vendors who will be the only approved and mandated sources of supply for the USAF for a possible five (5) years, when making purchases that fall under the scope of this program. The Government intends to issue a formal solicitation by way of a RFP in the near future.</p>
<p>The purpose of posting this DRAFT RFP is to elicit feedback from the potential bidders. We want to ensure: (1) that what we are asking for is clear, (2) that you can provide what we are asking for, (3) that you understand how you will be evaluated, (4) that you understand what will constitute being awarded a contract, (5) that our timelines are reasonable, and (6) that in general, the Government has not missed anything that will hinder your ability to be considered for part of this acquisition. It will be greatly beneficial if you provide detailed feedback for the attached items as they will be similar to the FINAL RFP. The feedback we receive from this will directly lead to a FINAL RFP once we receive approval.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation. This is a DRAFT RFP. Please, do not submit actual quotes, prices, marketing materials, or any other deliverables requested in the DRAFT RFP attachments. DO NOT fill out any of the attachments. DO NOT submit item prices or product information at this time. Attachments are only being included at this time to allow you the opportunity to review for content, and to provide feedback as detailed above.</p>
<p>Responses to this DRAFT RFP are required to be submitted in Microsoft Office products 2010 or newer or as a PDF file, and tables may be used. Please reference the attachment name and number, page number (if available), and section of the Draft RFP that you are commenting on in all responses. Each page of your response shall contain your company information in the header/footer or as a company logo. Please refrain from presenting marketing type material. All responses shall be emailed to the R3M Team Inbox at AFICA.R3M.Roofing_Program@us.af.mil no later than the closing date of this Draft RFP notice. Paper copies will not be accepted.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay and/or reimburse respondents and/or their associates for any cost incurred to submit the requested information. Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this DRAFT RFP.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award. Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.<br />.<br />This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).<br /><br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br /><br />Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.<br /><br />Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.<br /><br />Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>
<p>Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF TIERED EVALUATIONS:  This procurement is set-aside based on an order of priority as established in 38 U.S.C. 8127. TIERED EVALUATIONS INCLUDING LARGE BUSINESS CONCERNS: This solicitation is being issued as a tiered evaluation with the following tiers: (1) SDVOSB concerns, (2) VOSB concerns, (3) Ability One Procurement List, (4) small business concerns with HUBZone small business concerns and 8(a) participants having priority; and (5) large business concerns. If award cannot be made, the solicitation will be cancelled, and the requirement resolicited.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to issue Request for Quotes (RFQ) for the acquisition of consumable commodities in support of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program catalog.  The MSPV Program is a partnering effort between Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) and the VA Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction (OALC) to deliver a national strategic sourcing solution that combines a formulary approach with electronic cataloging and ordering of a wide range of medical and surgical supplies for the Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) and related facilities. The establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) is in direct support of this initiative and is a key element in the success of the MSPV Program as the BPAs will provide the mechanism that will supply the estimated 49,000 types of supplies for distribution to all VHA facilities located in the United States (US) and all US Territories.  In order to support the MSPV Program, the VA will establish BPAs for medical/surgical supplies through Open Market BPAs under FAR Parts 12/13. The solicitation will be structured as a tiered evaluation to maximize Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business (SD/VOSB) participation. Quotations will be evaluated based on technical, price, and past performance.  VHA clinicians will participate in evaluating all supplier quotations and awards will be made using comparative analysis.  An Authorized Distributor Letter from the Manufacturer shall be included with all responses.  The Authorized Distributor Letter from the Manufacturer shall include for each product(s) proposed authorizing the Offeror as a distributor for the proposed product(s).  The letter must either state specific product(s) proposed or that the Offeror is an authorized distributor for all of the Manufacturer s products.  This letter must be on the Manufacturer s letterhead and contain the signature of an authorized official for the Manufacturer.  In order for the authorized distributor/supplier to participate in the MSPV Program, the authorized distributor/supplier and the Prime Vendor shall establish a Commercial Agreement within 60 days of this award. The Commercial Agreement will govern the terms and conditions of the authorized distributor/supplier relationship and will not contradict the underlying terms and conditions established by this BPA or the underlying MSPV Contract.  The NAICS code for this procurement is _325611___.  Any future amendments and other miscellaneous documents will be available electronically for download at the following URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available, and no telephone requests for paper copies of the solicitation will be accepted. Interested offerors are advised to continuously check this URL for any changes to this solicitation. All responsible sources may submit an offer that if timely received, will be considered. The point of contact for this procurement is Laurinda.millage@va.gov or 706-733-0188, x1117________.

<p>This synopsis details the intent of the Government to release a sole-source solicitation for these NSNs to Raytheon Company (CAGE Code 05716). Only the source previously approved by the government for supply of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, please review the following steps that identify the technical data needed to demonstrate that a prospective contractor can competently manufacture an NSN to the same level of quality or better than the Approved Source. For an Alternate Product Please Submit in Accordance with the Following:<br /><br />An Alternate Offeror shall respond to the Contracting Specialist, Adam Sheir: Adam.Sheir@dla.mil, 410-459-2972 on whether they intend to offer the Government an alternative product and submit support documentation.<br /><br />The review process for alternate Offerors can take over 180 days from the date the alternate Offeror package is received. Once a decision is made, you will receive a notification advising you of the results.<br /><br />Alternate products may include a previously reverse-engineered product or a previously-approved product; and shall furnish the data required. Any product offered must be either the product cited from the Item Description listing above or be physically, mechanically, electrically, and functionally interchangeable with the product cited: <br /><br />(1) The Offeror must indicate that an alternate product is being offered if the Offeror is any one of the following: <br /><br />(i) An Offeror who (A) manufactures the item for an approved source currently cited; and (B) does not have authorization from that approved source to manufacture the item, identify it as the approved source part number, and sell the item directly to the Government; <br /><br />(ii) A dealer/distributor offering the product of a manufacturer that meets the description in subparagraph (i) above;<br /><br />(iii) An Offeror of a previously reverse-engineered product that is not currently cited; or(iv) Any other Offeror who does not meet the criteria in subparagraphs (b)(1), (d), or (e) of this provision.<br /><br />(2) If an alternate product is offered, the Offeror shall furnish legible copies of all drawings, specifications, or other data necessary to clearly describe the characteristics and features of the alternate product being offered. Data submitted shall cover design, materials, performance, function, interchangeability, inspection and/or testing criteria, and other characteristics of the offered product. If the offered product is to be manufactured in accordance with data the Offeror has obtained from elsewhere within the Government, the Offeror shall either furnish the detailed data specified in this paragraph, or supply a description of the data package in its possession; i.e., basic data document and revision, the date the data was obtained and from whom (Government agency/activity). If the Offeror does not furnish the detailed data with its offer, the Contracting Officer will be unable to begin evaluation of the offered product until such time as the detailed data can be obtained from the Government agency/activity possessing the data. If the alternate product is a previously reverse engineered product, the Offeror shall provide: traceability documentation to establish that the offered item represents the item specified (i.e., invoice from an approved source or submission of samples having markings of an approved source); number of samples that were examined; the process/logic used; raw data (measurements, lab reports, test results) used to prepare drawings or specifications for the offered item; any additional evidence that indicates the reverse-engineered item will function properly in the end item; and any evidence that life cycle/reliability considerations have been analyzed.<br /><br />(3) In addition, the Offeror may be required to furnish data describing the exact product cited. The data required from the Offeror depends on the level of technical data describing the exact product, if any, available to the Government. The possible levels of technical data the Government may have and the corresponding data submission requirements for Offerors are identified in subparagraphs (a)-(d) below. For the item(s) being acquired under this solicitation, the level of data in the Governments possession and the corresponding requirements for data submission are identified; or, if not specified, are as follows: [buyer insert (a), (b), (c), or (d), as applicable]. (If the level of data in the Governments possession and Offeror requirements for data submission are not identified in either the POT or PID or in this subparagraph (c)(3), then subparagraph (i) below applies.)<br /><br />(i) No data: This Agency has no data available for evaluating the acceptability of alternate products offered. In addition to the data required in subparagraph (c)(2) of this provision, the Offeror must furnish drawings and other data covering the design, materials, etc., of the exact product cited, sufficient to establish that the Offeror's product is equal to the product cited.<br /><br />(ii) Adequate proprietary (i.e., limited rights) data: This Agency possesses adequate drawings and/or specifications for the exact product as cited, but such data are proprietary (i.e., limited rights) and shall be used only for evaluation purposes. The Offeror must furnish the data required in subparagraph (c)(2) of this provision, but is not required to submit data on the exact product.<br /><br />(iii) Inadequate data: This Agency does not have adequate data available for evaluating the acceptability of alternate products offered. In addition to the data required in subparagraph (c)(2) of this provision, the Offeror must furnish drawings and other data covering the design, materials, etc., of the exact product cited, sufficient to establish that the Offeror's product is equal to the product cited.<br /><br />(iv) Adequate catalog data: This is a commercial off the shelf item.

In addition to the data required in subparagraph (c)(2) of this provision, the Offeror must furnish with its offer a commercially-acceptable cross reference list; or legible copies of all drawings, specifications or other data necessary to clearly describe the characteristics and features of the alternate product being offered, sufficient to establish that the Offeror's product is equal to the product cited. The Offeror is not required to submit data on the exact product.<br /><br />(4) The Contracting Officer will not evaluate offers of alternate product (which includes offers of previously reverse-engineered product) for the current procurement. Instead, the Offeror shall submit a request to the appropriate location for evaluation of the alternate products technical acceptability for future procurements of the same item. The request for evaluation shall cite the national stock number (NSN) of the exact product and, as identified in this synopsis, include the applicable level of technical data on the alternate and exact products. The level of technical data that the Government has available for use to evaluate the acceptability of an alternate product offered, and the corresponding level of technical data that must be furnished with an offer of alternate product, will be identified either or in paragraph (c)(2) of the provision at 52.217-9002. If the level of data and submission requirements are not identified in either of these locations in the solicitation, then 52.217-9002(c)(3)(i) applies.<br />To be considered for the existing requirement, approved sources responding to this notice of intent shall be submitted no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of synopsis. Please note, if evaluation of an approved alternate Offeror cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirement preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirement, award of the subject requirement will proceed.<br /><br />Please Note: This notice is not a Request for Proposal.

Damuth Trane is the sole certified provider in this region that can integrate the existing building controllers, set-up the software and program the system to NASA specifications. The current workforce has received considerable training on Trane equipment, and switching to a different vendor would require re-training, additional time and expenses. This requirement is a continuation of legacy NASA updates to the same existing building management system. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide the required service and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br /><br />The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on 09/17/2019. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.<br /><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.<br />

<DESC><div style="text-align: justify;">The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation N00024-19-R-4417 for the execution of the USS NEW YORK (LPD 21) Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) planned for fiscal year 2020 (FY20) schedule to start 14 September 2020 and complete 10 December 2021.  Upon completion of this CNO Availability, LPD 21 shall be capable of carrying out its respective mission with a reasonable expectation of maintaining a satisfactory condition of readiness until the next CNO-scheduled depot availability.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This CNO Availability will be solicited, competed, and awarded as private sector availabilities, using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).  The anticipated contracts, like all other CNO-scheduled depot availabilities, are considered supply contracts.  The supply being procured is the repaired, mission-ready vessel, which is returned to service with the Fleet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scope of the procurement includes all labor, supervision, production, testing and quality assurance necessary to prepare for and accomplish this CNO Availability. This CNO Availability is expected to require a highly capable contractor with substantial human resources capable of completing, coordinating and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair and modernization of the USS NEW YORK (LPD 21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) requires that full and open competition be used to the maximum extent practicable.  10 USC 7299a allows for the limitation of competition for "short term" availabilities (10 months or less) to the homeport, provided there is adequate competition.  Here, given that the availability will be greater than 10 months in duration, it will be competed on a coast-wide basis, without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. The solicitation will be issued electronically via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at http://fbo.gov and interested parties must comply with that announcement.  Interested offerors should monitor the FBO page for the release of the solicitation, and any applicable amendments.  Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to participate in this procurement at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  FBO is the single point of entry for posting of the synopsis and solicitations to the internet.  This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award of contracts.  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this synopsis.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Government anticipates release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) around 21 November 2019.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Government anticipates making a single award around May 2020.</div>

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a SPP agreement, ACT agreement, or CRADA agreement.<br /><br />THE TECHNOLOGY: <br />PNNL is performing research in the area of microbatteries and has developed systems and configurations that increase cell capacity, improve energy density, and contribute to large-scale manufacturability. Implementation of early versions of the microbatteries in acoustic transmitters for studying fish behavior demonstrate that the microbatteries have long-term shelf life and reliable performance. The most recent versions maximize the use of the very limited volume of microbatteries without sacrificing the utilization rate of the electroactive materials. The latest developments contribute to an improvement of 20% to 30% in capacity. PNNL's microbattery technologies are increasingly relevant as markets for downsized sensors, wearable devices, medical applications, and animal acoustic telemetry transmitters continue to grow.<br /><br />For all inquiries, please reference Battelle IPID 31442.<br /><br />NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than thirty (30) days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology. Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement. Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations. Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice, referencing Battelle IPID 31442.<br />

<p>A project is defined as a single contract or task order. Additionally, a project can also be defined as multiple task orders supporting one installation/facility or customer. For example, if a contractor has five task orders on one IDIQ contract supporting Newport Chemical Depot or the USAR, then those five task orders combined would constitute a project. All projects submitted must be at least 75% complete. If the project has multiple task orders, all task orders associated with the project must be at least 75% complete. Percent complete is based upon actual work, not percentage billed. The percentage complete must be clearly stated for each project submitted.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure, coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships between the prime firm and any significant subconsultant(s)) will be considered within quality management. These contracts have nationwide application to a wide variety of projects; however, specialized experience reflecting the following expertise may be rated more favorably.</p>
<p>&bull; Green and sustainable investigation and remediation techniques. <br />&bull; Innovative technology and approach in investigation and remediation.<br />&bull; HTRW investigation and remediation within Louisville District's Military mission boundaries.<br />&bull; Radiological investigation and remediation within the USACE's FUSRAP program boundaries.

<p>Both large and small businesses will be required to submit a Small Business Participation Plan under the unrestricted solicitation, which is an evaluation factor in the AE Selection process. Market research, based on the nature and location of the work is required to determine optimal percentage of total contract dollars planned to be performed by small businesses, however, the expected minimum participation goals are listed in the evaluation criteria below. Small business participation is the collective small business participation from any type of small business or sub-category small business. Work self-performed by a small business prime offeror will be credited as Small Business Participation.</p>
<p>The government will evaluate the proposals to determine which offeror(s) propose the best value in terms of meeting all the Small Business Participation goals using the following criteria:</p>
<p>(a) The level of commitment of small business prime offerors and level of commitment to small business subcontractors in terms of the percentage of the value of the total acquisition. The mandatory minimum Small Business participation is 8% of total contract dollars (aggregate of all small businesses participation including the small business socioeconomic contracting programs (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs). The following participation percentages are non-mandatory and should be validated through market research:</p>
<p>1. Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) 5% of total contract dollars.</p>
<p>2. Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) 5% of total contract dollars.</p>
<p>3. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) 3% of total contract dollars.</p>
<p>4. Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) 3% of total contract dollars.</p>
<p>(b)The extent to which such firms, as defined in FAR Part 19, are specifically identified in proposals;</p>
<p>(c) The extent of commitment to use such firms (existing and enforceable <br />Commitments will be considered more favorably than business relationships that are simply planned or theoretical);</p>
<p>(d) Identification of the complexity and variety of the work specific small firms are to perform;</p>
<p>All Offerors (both large and small businesses) are required to complete the following Small Business Participation Plan Form and submit with their proposal. This form will be the primary source of data used to evaluate the Small Business Participation factor.

<p style="text-align: left;">The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the repair data, capabilities, and experience to meet qualification requirements to repair the MC-130H Combat Talon II magnetrons and servo control module used in the AN/APQ-170(V) Receiver/Transmitters (R/Ts). The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Government does not own or have access to the data for these items. Communications &amp; Power Industries (CPI), CAGE Code 88236 is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for these radar components. The data for these assets is proprietary to CPI.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Repair Method Code (RMC) for these parts is R3; Repair, for the second or subsequent time, directly from the actual manufacturer. The Repair Method Suffix Code (RMSC) is C; these parts require engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique engineering skills and repair knowledge by the qualified source require repair of the part by the approved source. The approved source retains repair knowledge and technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify IAW the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div>The Government has determined that these items are not commercial items. These items were specifically designed for military use as part of the radar system they are used in.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Contractor shall furnish all material, support equipment, tools, test equipment, and services. The contractor is responsible for providing, maintaining, and calibrating all support equipment required at their facility or a subcontractor&rsquo;s facility.

<div>The Government&rsquo;s needs for repair services are required in order to support current Air Force Special Operation missions. The AN/APQ-170 Multi-Modal Radar is used to perform terrain-following and terrain-avoidance features, as well as ground-mapping, weather detection and avoidance, and beacon interrogation modes of operation. These special navigation and aerial delivery systems are used to locate small drop zones and deliver people or equipment with greater accuracy and at higher speeds than possible with a standard C-130. The MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft can penetrate hostile airspace at low altitudes for night and adverse weather operations. These Receiver/Transmitter Components are Mission Critical for the AN/APQ-170 Multi-Modal led in the MC-130H Combat Talon II.</div>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) Questionnaire<br />F-15E Ammunition Container
<p>The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and repair of the F-15E Ammunition Container for use by the U.S. Air Force. If after reviewing the requirement, you desire to participate in the RFI, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. If you lack sufficient experience/capabilities in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement.</p>
<p>NSN is 1005- 01-298-2522 P/N is 10029110, and Repair Method Code (RMC) is R3.</p>
<p>Current source is General Dynamics-Ordinance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS).</p>
<p>This item has an RMC/RMSC of R3, and this code is used when the Government did not initially purchase the data and/or rights. GD-OTS is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and has proprietary rights of the data; therefore, they are the only company with the full source documentation detailing the design, operation, manufacturing details and repair of the F-15E Ammunition Container. Existing knowledge of the design, special tooling, unique engineering skills, specifications, function data, schematics, drawings, and knowledge of required manufacturing processes requires acquisition of the part from only GD-OTS.</p>

The provision of health services to members of federally-recognized tribes grew out of the special government-to-government relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes. This relationship, established in 1787, is based on Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, and has been given form and substance by numerous treaties, laws, Supreme Court decisions, and Executive Orders. The IHS is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for Indian people and its goal is to raise their health status to the highest possible level. The IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for American Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of 566 federally recognized Tribes across the U.S.</span></p>

<p>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE/TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>With the recent AIR 00 update and release of NAVAIR Instruction 4790.36 (JUL 2018), an emphasis on equipment readiness improvement through institution of a proactive Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) program was established.  Lessons Learned has proven that in the majority of obsolete part cases, the benefit of a having a proactive process results in more timely responses to emergent part shortage or part discontinuance announcements.  Also in the majority of DMSMS cases, identifying the issues proactively up-front and having additional schedule provides more time for procurement of limited end-of-life parts and developing contract requirements for longer-term DMSMS solutions.  In addition the proactive DMSMS process also provides required data and insight into other processes such as roadmap planning/alignment, resource planning/requests, priority assignment, risk assignment, schedule considerations and alignment to other common contract efforts.</p>
<p>Note:  DMSMS and obsolescence are terms that are often used interchangeably but are sometimes interpreted differently.  The term DMSMS is always associated with part shortages whereas the term obsolescence can describe or reference part shortages or used to describe technology obsolescence from an operational perspective.</p>

<p>SCOPE - CONTRACTOR RESPONSE TO RFI</p>
<p>The Contractor response to this RFI is expected to consist of a description of the Contractors DMSMS process and typical approach to a proactive DMSMS Program for NAVAIR.  For various contract and legal reasons, it is understood that only reactive monitoring can be accomplished for some areas of DMSMS coverage, but the Government maintains the majority of NAVAIR equipment which requires proactive monitoring based on many factors that should be explained by the Contractor as part of the response to the RFI.</p>

The minimum day charge applies when the contractor makes timely delivery of the equipment and supplies to the VAMC s site on a schedule day. If the equipment and supplies are delivered to the VAMC s site and equipment is inoperable for 60 minutes or more with the result that the designated surgeon must postpone surgical procedures, the contractor will forego the charge for that surgical procedure. 

SCOPE, TASKS, OR REQUIREMENTS:

A.  The Contractor shall provide a Lithotripter and an imaging system (fluoroscopy).  The equipment shall be delivered by the Contractor to the Erie VAMC s warehouse/loading dock.  The Contractor is responsible for transporting the equipment from the warehouse/loading dock to the Operating Room. The Erie VAMC staff members will damp-dust the equipment prior to being moved to the Operating Room.  The Contractor shall set up and prepare the equipment for patient use.  The Contractor shall provide assistance and support during ancillary procedures. 

B. The Contractor warrants that the equipment is fit for its intended use and purpose. The Contractor shall maintain equipment in a manner that meets the requirements of all applicable professional and regulatory standards and is responsible for current inspection. A certificate of the current inspection may be required. Preventative maintenance records will accompany the Contractor's equipment to the Erie VAMC and may be reviewed on each visit by the Biomedical Department. Both parties acknowledge that during equipment repair/maintenance, the schedule may need to be adjusted to accommodate down time of the equipment. 

The lithotripsy radiologic technician will bring in the requested equipment directly to the Operating Room at the VAMC for use in operative procedures.  It is expected that all requested equipment meets the inspection criteria of the VAMC Biomedical Department.  In addition to monitoring lithotripsy equipment before and during procedures, the radiologic technician shall serve as a consultant for all equipment.

C.  Approximately 2-3 lithotripsy procedures are anticipated to be scheduled every other month.

D.  Ancillary procedures performed on the equipment in order to assure proper visualization of the target stone, or proper elimination of stone fragments to include, but are not limited to, cystoscopies, contrast studies in excess of 15 minutes, and stent replacements.

IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS FOR SEAMLESS AND INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE SOLUTION INTEROPERABLE WITH VA ORACLE INSTALLATIONS
This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice ONLY issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  The information provided may be used by VA in developing its acquisition strategy and Performance Work Statement.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  Responses should be no longer than 10 pages.

VA is issuing this RFI to identify comprehensive integrated software solutions that exist today that can meet and integrate with the requirements identified below for over 600 enterprise databases, over 1,000 middleware installations, supporting a workforce of more than 600,000 users (including employees, volunteers and contactors) and millions of veterans and family members who utilize VA information technology (IT) solutions for medical care and benefits processing. 

VA already has a comprehensive Oracle solution in place, which operates on Linux, Solaris, HP-UX/AIX, UNIX and IBM Operating Systems, that already provides this integrated solution.  This existing solution provides a seamless interoperability between legacy systems and new systems running on VA Infrastructure and in 3rd party clouds including AWS and Azure.  

VA has an extensive 30+ year investment in the Oracle product suite, thousands of trained technicians, and extensive experience with that technology.  VA's desire at this time is not to replace the Oracle investment, but to assess the current marketplace for an alternative to augment and expand the comprehensive, seamless integrated environment provided by the Oracle products currently in place.  Manufacturers that can provide a solution that seamlessly integrates with the existing Oracle footprint are requested to provide a description of that product set and provide examples of that environment currently operating in implementations of the same size and scope.  VA is focused on determining if the proposed implementations are of the same size and scope, provide the same level of seamless integration, and are as comprehensive as that currently operating and available to VA from Oracle.  More specifically, is the solution proposed, equal to or greater than the capabilities of that provided by the Oracle solution operating within VA and is that comprehensive solution successfully deployed and fully operational to the same levels as VA in a seamless integrated environment of the same size and scope as VA?  The entire solution must provide security that meets Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 and be fully compliant with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  It must also provide capabilities equal to or greater than those provided by Oracle for high-availability, persistent data protection and prevention of loss of data. 

To support our mission, VA intends to continue to maintain, operate, update and upgrade as necessary, the current Oracle solution already owned by VA.  The VA currently operates over 550,000 workstations and 35,000 servers to provide a broad range of IT capabilities to every user across the agency.  VA holds perpetual licenses for a significant number of Oracle products that operate on these systems (e.g. Database, WebLogic, Primavera, Advanced Compression, GoldenGate, Business Inteligence, Siebel CRM, Tuxedo and others).  Responses should not include proposals to replace these existing products/installations.

For new Database, WebLogic, Primavera, Advanced Compression, GoldenGate, Business Inteligence, Siebel for CRM and Tuxedo deployments, VA requires a seamless and integrated enterprise solution that is interoperable with existing VA Oracle installations.  VA currently utilizes the Oracle products mentioned above for critical tasks throughout VA, such as claims processing, clinician collaboration, provision of patient care, Veteran medical records data entry, secure transmission of patient data, and real-time access to patient data by clinicians and patients.  Proposed solutions must have no negative impact on the performance or availability of any existing VA applications utilizing these Oracle products. 

VA requires a seamless and integrated enterprise solution that is compatible with and runs on Linux, Solaris, HP-UX/AIX, UNIX and IBM Operating Systems. 

Specifically, VA seeks answers to the questions in the table below for each of the following 8 areas.

Area 1: Oracle Database Enterprise Edition
Area 2: Oracle WebLogic Suite
Area 3: Oracle Advanced Compression
Area 4: Oracle GoldenGate
Area 5: Oracle Business Inteligence Suite Extended Edition
Area 6: Siebel Customer Relationship Management
Area 7: Primavera P6 Enterprise Project Portfolio Management
Area 8: Tuxedo

Complete the following table for each of the above eight areas:

Identify Area being addressed by this product/solution (Areas 1   8)

Name of proposed product/solution

Is product/solution 100% compliant with Section 508?

When will product/solution be 100% 508 compliant?

Variances in capabilities from existing Oracle product identified

Is the product/solution 100% backward compatible and will it support files and file type created with the competing Oracle product?

Manner of implementation (on-prem, cloud, etc.).  Can it be supported in both AWS and Azure clouds?

Type licensing (device, user, concurrent use, processor, core, etc.)

Identify implementations of similar size, scope and complexity.

Cost to implement the product/solution (i.e. how much will it cost VA to acquire the software, and implement the solution so that it can operate and integrate with the existing Oracle environment

Recurring operational costs (software only) (i.e. What is the annual cost to maintain the software licenses so that VA can take advantage of the latest commercially available release of the product?)

Cost to add one additional user (software only) (i.e. When VA needs to expand usage, what are the estimated costs to add one additional user to the solution either in terms of additional license costs or additional usage costs?)

Recurring cloud-based operational costs (if proposed for Cloud) (i.e. What are the recurring annual costs to operate the proposed solution

Identify and describe Transitional impacts

Time required to transition

Other costs (i.e. what other costs do you foresee that may be incurred if VA elects to change from the existing Oracle product to the product/solution being proposed?)

Identify implementation impacts

Identify operational impacts

Identify end-user operational impacts

Is the product/solution compliant with HSPD-12 and NIST for Multifactor Authentication?

Is the product/solution compatible with Smartcard Login?


Additionally, please provide at a minimum the following data:

Name of Company
Address
Point of Contact
Phone Number

<SUBJECT>High Frequency (HF) Radios for Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) - Request for Information
<SOLNBR>W15P7T-20-R-0004
<RESPDATE>110519
<CONTACT>Lee ALEXIS, Contract Specialist , Phone 4438614965, Email Lee.Alexis.civ@mail.mil - Brian Bosmans, Contracting Officer, Phone 4438614972, Email Brian.c.Bosmans.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />High Frequency (HF) Radios for Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR)
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1  The Project Manager for Tactical Radios (PM TR) seeks industry interest regarding availability of representative High Frequency (HF) radios to meet communications requirements supporting Army ground platforms.   PdM Helicopter and Multi-Mission Radios (HAMMR) is interested in HF radios currently available from industry that are capable or can be quickly adapted for use in existing radio configurations without removing or replacing the entire installation kit.  PdM HAMMR is interested in responses for products that can be delivered in production quantities that satisfy functional and performance requirements.  The HF Radio will support open interface standards (both hardware and software) such as VICTORY, and are implemented with Army interoperable message formats for receiving and sending data, and for remotely managing the system.<br />Initial HF Radio acquisition will include plans to replace specific legacy single-channel HF receiver-transmitters, using a one-for-one ratio.  The HF Radio may later augment current HF radio fielding allocations, including those employed on mobile platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not promise a Statement of Intent or constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue either in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supplies or services whatsoever.  Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if issued.  If a Statement of Intent or RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br />PM TR released a RFI on FedBizOpps dated 17 April, 2019 (W15P7T-19-R-HF01).  Since that time, there have been changes within PM TR's plan to modernize the Army's HF capability.  The aforementioned RFI stated an initial quantity needed by the Army of approximately five hundred radios and also discussed HF solutions for the Army's aviation platforms.  The purpose of this revised RFI is to focus solely on the HF capabilities currently available for the ground tier.  PM TR will be releasing an aviation specific RFI for HF capabilities in the coming months.  The requirements within section 3.0 have been updated, where appropriate, to reflect only the ground tier.  <br />The High Frequency Radio provides both Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) secure voice communications and data capabilities.  The HF Radio operates in the High Frequency range (1.5 to 30 megahertz or MHz) using ground and sky-wave propagation over extended distances and operational ranges.  HF Radio communications will utilize Automatic Radio Control System (ARCS) that require minimal operator interaction to establish and maintain connections between nodes.   The HF Radio is a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) or similar technology supported by a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) supporting numerous configurations including platform mounted or dismountable/man-portable/handheld capabilities.  The HF Radio supports flexible and robust terrestrial and air-ground Army and Joint Service communications interoperability essential to Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).  The HF Radio will employ measures to reduce the effect of threat electronic warfare (EW) capabilities and to address shortfalls and capability gaps described in the 2020/2024 Gap Analysis.  HF Radios will support Common Operating Environment (COE) tenets and support information transport between Mounted, Mobile/Hand-held, and Command Post computing environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will conduct an industry days at FAA offices in Atlanta, GA, Fort Worth, TX and Seattle, WA on November 19, 2019 to welcome qualified vendors capable of providing all personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supervision for a broad range construction services. 

The purpose of industry day is to address the following: 

1. The FAA will provide a program overview and preliminary requirements. 
2. Vendor one-on-ones will have the opportunity to meet with FAA representatives to present their company information and provide feedback on the preliminary requirements. 
3. To gage the ability of the marketplace to provide regional and nationwide construction services.
4. To gage the interest of capable vendors that fall into the following categories: large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms that can provide a wide range of construction services. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses and other market research is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The FAA is considering issuance of a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to support the following two programs, but not all inclusive:

a. EnRoute Facilities Planning and Modernization Program supports EnRoute Air Traffic operations and service level availability through facility life cycle program management of the 21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), the Combined EnRoute Radar Approach Control Facilities (CERAPs) at San Juan and Guam and other FAA owned, operated, or sponsored facilities.

b. Terminal Facilities Office Planning and Execution Program supports the construction of new and replacement of Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities within the National Airspace System (NAS), in addition to the repair, maintenance and upgrading of these facilities throughout their lifecycles. 

Background: The mission of the FAA Terminal Facilities Planning and Execution Team and EnRoute Facilities Planning and Modernization Team is to modernize and sustain the air traffic control and radar approach facilities that comprise almost 400 million gross square feet. Many facilities in the NAS operate 24-hours per day and provide services critical to safety. The continued operation of all equipment in the NAS and the safety of life and property are paramount considerations in all work conducted under this contract.

BOA Scope of Work: Vendors shall furnish all personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supervision to accomplish a broad range construction services including, but not limited to design, design-build, build, new construction, repair, alteration, demolition, site work, excavation, cast-in-place concrete, masonry, structural steel, electrical, mechanical (including HVAC), painting, carpentry, roofing, millwork, road repair, and other specialty and general construction. All work will be ordered by the Contracting Officer using BOA Call Orders. Call Orders will identify the scope of work, schedule, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.

The FAA anticipates issuing BOAs for the following thresholds: 

1. SMALL BOA - REGIONAL 
 Projects ranging from $10K-$500K
 Regional Service Areas (Eastern, Central, Western)
 3 vendors per Service Area

2. MEDIUM BOA - REGIONAL
 Projects ranging from $500K-$2M
 Regional Service Areas (Eastern, Central, Western)
 3 vendors per Service Area

3. LARGE BOA - NATIONWIDE
 Projects ranging from $2M and greater

<CONTACT>Joshua T. Lazarus, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014436677, Email josh.lazarus@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a <strong>Request for Information (RFI)</strong>. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <strong>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes</strong>. <br /><strong><br />Purpose and Objectives:</strong> <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) conducts state-of-the-art research on basic mechanisms that underlie drug abuse and addiction, and to develop new methods for the treatment of drug abuse and addiction. In general, these studies evaluate the nature of drug abuse and addiction by assessing the abuse potential of drugs, investigating their underlying mechanisms and assessing treatment modalities for substance use disorders. <br /><br />In support of its mission, NIDA IRP is seeking information from companies with experience in providing participant advertising and recruitment services, participant eligibility screening, and remuneration support necessary to maintain the operation of the NIDA-IRP's Clinical Research Program. Through this RFI, NIDA IRP hopes to:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Learn about the current best practices in the fields of research participant recruitment, advertising, and screening services for clinical research studies;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Obtain recommendations from industry experts on processes and procedures to achieve the project requirements identified below; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Identify specific metrics that can be used to measure the success and effectiveness of targeted advertising and recruitment campaigns; and <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Identify companies that have the experience and capabilities necessary to support the requirements stated below.<br /><strong><br />Requirement Background:</strong> <br /><br />The current NIDA IRP Participant Recruitment Support Services contract has 3 main requirements. The activities associated with each requirement is broadly described below:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Targeted Advertising and Recruitment of Specific Populations of Research Subjects:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Studies require specific populations to be targeted based on varying Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and may include those who are generally healthy but may also have substance use disorders and those who do not have a substance use disorder, but are otherwise closely matched (e.g. with regard to socioeconomic status (SES), IQ, race, ethnicity, etc.). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Most research participants will need to be local to the Baltimore/ Washington metropolitan area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Some populations will be easier to recruit than others and NIDA IRP will need the contractor to use evidence-based statistics and creativity when devising recruitment strategies to target each population. Target populations include but are not limited to those who smoke cigarettes (treatment seeking and non-treatment seeking), ex-smokers, and those with marijuana, opioid, cocaine or alcohol use disorders, not necessarily in combination with one another, who may or may not be seeking or are in treatment. Some studies are also seeking to enroll HIV positive populations. Many studies look for participants who do not have dual substance use disorders, nor other comorbidities such as mental health disorders, or any significant illness.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. The NIDA-IRP has had low rates of enrollment for Hispanic populations and some challenges recruiting females, so increasing overall enrollment of these populations is also needed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. The Clinical Program also has many Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies or studies utilizing non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (e.g. transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which require different inclusion/exclusion criteria. These criteria have made recruitment challenging but is important to the science of the studies and recruitment targets must be reached within reasonable timeframes.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Most studies have a target enrollment of 12-15 new participants per month, per study.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Ongoing and evolving advertisements - NIDA IRP needs the marketing strategies (e.g. performance of each ad) used to be tracked and the effectiveness of each ad to be assessed, continuously monitored and have the results used to develop plans to improve strategies and optimize recruitment goals per protocol on an ongoing basis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Recruitment strategies are expected to include but are not limited to print, internet, community outreach, working with local clinics and businesses to raise awareness of available research studies or to obtain and track participant referrals.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Screening Research Candidates:&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Two phases of screening Research Candidates are currently conducted: 1) telephone interviews and 2) in-person screening.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The telephone interview is a structured computer-based screening process and designed to capture relevant information from the aforementioned populations to assess their histories and needs, interpreting the data in the context of the current epidemiology and natural history of drug use, misuse, use disorders and treatment for appropriate referral to research opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Current volume of phone screens is approximately 350 per month and generally Monday through Friday from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM. However, the IRP would like to solicit industry standards for the best way to handle higher volumes of calls and more flexible time-frames to accommodate research candidates.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Approximately 100 initial and 100 follow up in-person screening appointments are scheduled monthly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. The in-person screening process includes basic medical assessments (e.g. obtaining vital signs, drawing blood, performing echocardiograms (ECGs), urine pregnancy testing, CO monitoring, breathalyzer and testing urine for drugs of abuse. The Contractor will also supply the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waiver testing kits needed for pregnancy, HIV and urine testing for drugs of abuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. The screening process also includes assessment of drug use disorders via medical and psychiatric measures, and psychiatric interviewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Travel and Remuneration Support:<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. In keeping with the NIDA Remuneration Policy, participants receive remuneration as they complete sections of a protocol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Remuneration may be dispersed as checks, gift cards or cash, or paying bills for the participant as defined by the protocol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. NIDA IRP also coordinates transportation as needed per protocol (e.g. taxi, train, bus, plane, Uber, Lyft) and possibly local hotel accommodations, consistent with NIH policies.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. As some studies require multiple visits, transportation can be a challenge for some participants due to lengthy public transit times. Unique approaches to transportation that is cost effective and less burdensome to participants is also sought.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. All expenses must be tracked in the individual's electronic medical record in addition to overall record keeping of all funds distributed.<br /><strong><br />Information Sought/Capability Statement:</strong> <br /><br />The information requested in this RFI is intended for planning purposes only. Interested organizations should include relevant and specific information on each of the following questions below:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Describe the current best practices in the fields of research participant recruitment, advertising, and screening services for clinical research studies;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.

<DESC><strong>Description:</strong>
<p>The purpose of this industry day is to familiarize industry with the projected opportunity, determine industry capabilities, identify potential sources, and receive industry feedback. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start, through the Program Support Center (PSC), has a requirement to procure twelve (12) Regional Training and Technical Assistance contracts that will provide local grantees with high-quality, sustained, and intensive training and technical assistance that, "to the maximum extent practicable," improves the capacity of local programs to deliver services that, at a minimum, meet or exceed the priority areas described in section 641 (A)(a)(1) of the Head Start Act, as amended December 12, 2007: correction of findings identified through the federal monitoring system; school readiness; and, training/professional development needs of staff.</p>
<p>The twelve ACF Regions include the following states and entities:</p>
<p>&bull; Region 1 - Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont <br />&bull; Region 2 - New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands<br />&bull; Region 3 - Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia <br />&bull; Region 4 - Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee <br />&bull; Region 5 - Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin <br />&bull; Region 6 - Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas<br />&bull; Region 7 - Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska<br />&bull; Region 8 - Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming<br />&bull; Region 9 - Arizona, California, Nevada, and Hawaii/Outer Pacific (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau)<br />&bull; Region 10 - Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington<br />&bull; Region 11 -American Indian/Alaska Native grantees in 26 states across the country<br />&bull; Region 12 - Migrant and Seasonal grantees in 38 states across the country</p>
<p>Each ACF Region will include several Early Childhood (EC) Specialists, with the number of EC Specialists proportionate with the number of grantees and delegates within that region. The work of these specialists shall be directed toward two of the three priority areas: school readiness and the training/career development needs of teaching staff.</p>
<p>The Early Childhood (EC) Specialist position requires a minimum of a BA or BS Degree, with a preference for a Master's degree. The degrees for at least 75% of the EC Specialists must be in Early Childhood Education/Development or related field. If the highest degree was awarded more than ten years ago, the resume should be specific regarding courses, conferences, seminars attended that ensure the specialist remains current in the field of early childhood education/development.<br />EC Specialists must have a minimum of 5 years' experience in programs for young children. The experience of some of the EC Specialists must be specific to programs serving infants and toddlers. Experience should include the provision of training and technical assistance to teachers/home visitors and/or education managers in early childhood programs.</p>
<p>In addition, the government is seeking to secure the services of several Grantee Specialists for each region. These specialists shall be deployed by the regional office to work on the third priority area: deficiencies identified through the monitoring system. Grantee specialists may also be deployed to work with grantees with multiple areas of noncompliance, grantees with concerns raised through risk management meetings, or grantees about which concerns have been raised though other data sources, such as the Head Start Program Information Report (PIR).</p>
<p>The Grantee Specialist position requires a BA or BS Degree, with a preference for a Master's degree. A minimum of 5 years of experience related to program design and management of fiscal operations in or with Head Start/Early Head Start programs and the development and implementation of comprehensive management systems.</p>
<p>In each region, there shall be a Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) Coordinator who will work with federal personnel to coordinate the work of the various states and provide ongoing supervision of TTA staff. The TTA Coordinator shall also be responsible for the implementation of quality assurance processes to ensure the appropriate provision of TTA and contract deliverables.<br />The TTA Coordinator position requires a BA or BS Degree, with a preference for a Master's degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of 7 years' experience is required with 10 years preferred. This experience must include at least 3 years with the provision of high-level technical assistance and consultation to Head Start programs; 3-5 years of progressive supervisory/management experience with a preference for experience managing remote-located staff/teams; and expertise and experience in budget oversight and management.</p>
<p>The place of performance for all contract staff shall be at a physical location within a state in the region for which the awarded contract is providing services. To provide economies of scale, the use of home offices is strongly encouraged. Virtual offices may not be substituted for a physical presence in the region. <br />Services may be provided off-site, on-site, through virtual media, or a combination thereof. Other places of performance include, but are not limited to, contractor physical locations, Head Start grantee facilities, hotel meeting rooms, ACF Regional Offices, at third-party sponsored conferences and other locations throughout the U.S.<br />Twelve cost-reimbursement type contracts will be awarded for a 12 month base period and four 12 month option periods for a total of 60 months. Responses to the Request for Proposal package will be due within 60 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP. Award of this requirement is anticipated by July 1, 2020.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development, Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance under the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/DCHA/OFDA), intends to award a Personal Services Contract (PSC) without competition for a period of one year for the position of Support Relief Group (SRG) - Generalist /GS-12 worldwide. An award for the provision of highly specialized services to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government and would result in unacceptable delays. Performance of the proposed PSC is critical to the mission of USAID and is in the best interest of the United States Government. This notice is published in accordance with FAR 5.201 and FAR 5.203.

<p>The proposal could result in a Government real estate transaction or transactions with the selected Offeror(s) for JBLE-Langley and JBLE-Eustis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At JBLE-Langley, the Government proposes to potentially lease the Leased Premises to the Highest Responsive Offeror(s)(HRO) "as is/where is" for the term of the resultant lease agreement, expected to be a length of five to fifteen years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At JBLE-Eustis the proposal would require the Offeror to work proposal with a privatized vendor directly and obtain access from the installation.</p>
<p>The Government requests qualifications / proposals from highly-qualified Offeror(s)s to design, engineer, construct, own, operate, manage, and maintain new "Co-Locatable" telecommunications solution systems including necessary support equipment and structures, related infrastructure and improvements whose purpose is to provide 4G wireless voice and data service or greater to JBLE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The infrastructure shall also allow for future transition to 5G or other cellular service advancements during the term of the lease if proposed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any proposed solution<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>shall be of sufficient height, capacity, and structural integrity to accommodate multiple wireless telecommunication service providers' antennas, with the possibility of including Air Force equipment, not to exceed 150ft and not obstruct JBLE flying operations.</p>

<p>The objectives of the Project are to determine and select the HRO who can best:</p>
<p>4.1. Provide wireless telecommunication voice and data services at JBLE where current services are not extended or have a less than 4G coverage.</p>
<p>4.2. Provide the highest consideration above fair market value (FMV)* in exchange for granting a leasehold interest of the property; with a 3% annual escalation clause or as may be negotiated upon selection of the HRO.</p>
<p>4.3. Optimize the use of the property in accordance with the Enabling Statue and within the constraints and restrictions documented in the RFP.</p>
<p>4.4. Lease the property in a manner that is compatible with the JBLE mission and adjacent Government use.</p>
<p>4.5. Optimize the consideration to be received by the Government from the HRO.</p>
<p>* FMV will be based on the area(s) proposed by the Offeror(s) for location(s) of proposed infrastructure / equipment required to complete the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once the area is identified by an Offeror(s), the 99th Civil Engineering Squadron - Real Property office will be responsible for finalizing the Government's FMV and used as the basis for final negotiations with the HRO.</p>

The contract will enable procurement of commercial and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items not otherwise available through Required Sources of Supply, non-developmental items (NDI), modified COTS, and associated training and product support to support approximately 3,500 United States Air Force (USAF) Special Warfare operators assigned to Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), and other authorized users including foreign military allies.</p>
<p>In general, the scope of the acquisition includes special operational equipment for ground mobility, aerial insertion, maritime/dive, assault zones, weather sensing, information technology, and surveying/mapping, including general apparel/personnel protective equipment, footwear, bags/packs, climbing, survival and navigation, and visual augmentation equipment.</p>

<p><br />6.  Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Work includes, but is not limited to, providing indoor and outdoor spaces to maintain and monitor approximately 300 Fraxinus uhdei (Tropical Ash) trees and tree care for the same. Services are anticipated to begin immediately after award. Requirements are further as follows;</p>
<p>I. Objective<br />To contract for services to grow and maintain 300 Fraxinus uhdei (Tropical Ash) trees that will support a significant portion of the leaves needed to successfully operate the emerald ash borer (EAB) biocontrol rearing facility. The contractor must also repot the 300 trees utilizing existing pots and trim roots to allow for repotting. The contractor's space for growing and maintaining the trees must be located within approximately 20 miles from the USDA APHIS PPQ office, located at 5936 Ford Court, Suite 200, Brighton, MI 48116.<br />II. Background<br />EAB is a very small but very destructive beetle. Metallic green in color, its slender body measures 1/2 inch in length and 1/8 inch wide. The average adult beetle can easily fit on a penny. Native to China and eastern Asia, the EAB probably landed in North America hidden in wood packing materials commonly used to ship consumer goods, auto parts, and the like. Although no one can say for sure when EAB arrived in southeastern Michigan, the scientific community believes the beetle went undetected for over 10 years, based on its widespread distribution and destruction. EAB was officially identified in the summer of 2002.<br />This beetle has been found in 5 states and the District of Columbia (Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) and is responsible for the death or decline of tens of millions of ash trees and billions more are at risk. In addition, the Canadian government has also been engaged in an EAB program of its own.<br />In an effort to control the spread of damage caused by EAB, USDA&#8208;APHIS&#8208;PPQ turned to the release of biocontrol agents.<br />Four parasitic wasps are currently being released as biocontrol agents that target different life stages of EAB. These parasitioids are reared from EAB larvae at the mass rearing facility in Brighton, MI. Several EAB colonies are maintained in order to obtain sufficient numbers of EAB to support parasitoid rearing operations. The maintenance of these colonies requires several components, but perhaps none more important than high quality leaf material.<br />III. Scope of Work<br />A. Maintain highly productive F. uhdei trees with the intention of using leaves to rear Emerald Ash Borer Beetles (EAB) to support biocontrol efforts of the same.<br />&bull;	Provide appropriate night/day heated (74&#8208;82&#8304;F) indoor space (~3000 sq ft) for continual growth of 300 mature F. uhdei trees during winter months or when threatened with frost.<br />&bull;	Supply space during summer months that will provide adequate temperatures to avoid heat damage (outdoor area is sufficient).<br />&bull;	Monitor and report the health of plants, which will include insect damage and signs of stress that would occur from inappropriate watering, fertilizing, and lighting regimes.<br />&bull;	Modify work plans with cooperation from EAB rearing facility manager to address plant health issues.<br />&bull;	Maintain adequate staffing throughout the year to ensure delivery of labor to water and fertilize as needed and to monitor plant health. Plants will need to be root pruned and repotted with new soil and fertilizer approximately every 24 months.  Soil and fertilizer mixtures shall be directed by the rearing facility manager. <br />&bull;	Supply the resources necessary to maintain adequate temperature, watering, and fertilizing schedules to facilitate leaf production and hardening.<br />&bull;	When biocontrol applications/pest trapping are deemed necessary, a schedule of biocontrol releases/trapping and the appropriate biocontrol agents/traps will be supplied to the contractor by the Government. The contractor shall release the biocontrol agents and hang traps according to the supplied schedule and product directions. Certain situations may warrant the use of pesticides to be supplied by the contractor, but this decision will ultimately be made by the EAB biocontrol facility manager and would require a modification to the contract in accordance with clause 52.212&#8208;4.  Pesticides cannot be used.<br />&bull;	Maintenance log will be maintained and made available for review upon request. Maintenance log will include schedules for watering, fertilizing, and lighting as well as any situational modifications made.<br />B. Logistics<br />&bull;	Plants will be on the contractor's facility within 10 days following contract award.<br />Delivery will be made by the government and coordinated with the Contractor. The EAB rearing facility manager, team leaders, and maintenance engineer will have unrestricted access to area housing PPQ trees for emergency purposes.<br />&bull;	Personnel (facility manager, team leaders, and lab technicians) from the EAB rearing facility will travel to the selected greenhouse to select and harvest leaves used in the production facility during regular business hours, unless otherwise discussed.<br />C. Deliverables<br />&bull;	High quality, nutritious leaf material that supports beetle rearing operations.<br />&bull;	Emergency Contacts (names and phone numbers to be added at time of award)<br />D. Period of Performance<br />&bull;	The contractor shall be required to commence work under this contract within 10 calendar days after the date the Contractor receives the notice of award. Services are anticipated to begin November 1, 2019. This contract includes a 12&#8208;month base period and three 12&#8208;month option periods. The Government has the option to extend the term of this contract by exercising option periods in accordance with clause 52.217&#8208;9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.<br />Base Period:  Award Date through October 31, 2020.<br />Option 1:  November 1, 2020 through October 31, 2021.<br />Option 2:  November 1, 2021 through October 31, 2022.<br />Option 3:  November 1, 2022 through October 31, 2023.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Exam Table Paper. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Exam Table Paper products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMM Online web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Exam Table Paper in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Exam Table Paper will be established approximately 05 February 2020 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately 05 March 2020, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Exam Table Paper. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Exam Table Paper.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Exam Table Paper. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $669,561. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Four items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 94.00 % ($692,695) of the total volume in sales ($669,561). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 4:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong><br />1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample.

For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Towels, Surgical in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Towels, Surgical will be established approximately 07 March 2020 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately 07 April 2020, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Towels, Surgical. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Towels, Surgical.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Towels, Surgical. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,219,943. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Thirteen items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($1,219,943.06) of the total volume in sales ($1,219,943.06). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below.

<SOLNBR>89303920NEM000007
<RESPDATE>110419
<ARCHDATE>11192019
<CONTACT>Corbett, Timothy E.
<DESC>The US Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office (RL), intends to extend the Mission Support Contract with Mission Support Alliance, LLC (MSA), to furnish safe, compliant, cost-effective and energy-efficient services to further the DOE-RL mission to continue site infrastructure and services while the Department completes the acquisition process for the follow-on procurement and transition to the new contractor.  The proposed contract extension is for up to 6 months from November 26, 2019, through May 25, 2020. The estimated value of this extension is $225 million, based on available funding.
Services at the Hanford Site as listed below are contemplated as part of the contract extension.  Mission Support Services for the Hanford Site include five primary functions:  
1) Safety, Security, and Environment, 
2) Site Infrastructure and Utilities, 
3) Site Business Management, 
4) Information Resources/Content Management, and 
5) Portfolio Management.  

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)), implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The present contract with MSA is due to expire on November 25, 2019.  Extensive advance planning for the follow-on procurement has been on-going and the proposed contract extension will allow the aforementioned activities to continue at the DOE Hanford site until completion of the process to select and transition to a successful contractor representing the best value to the government.

MSA as the incumbent contractor is the only contractor who has the unique qualifications to continue the necessary activities at the DOE Hanford site without a break in service until award and transition to the successor contractor is complete.  Extension of the current contract will only be in force as long as needed after award of the new contract and a transition period to the new contractor. 

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS UNDER FAR PART 12, 15, OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS UNDER FAR PART 14. IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

Interested parties believing they have all of the capabilities may submit capability statements to provide all of the services, including a demonstration of the ability to meet all of the needs identified above within the required timeframes. The capabilities statement describing and demonstrating the above shall be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice to the following address:  U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, P.O. Box 550, H5 20, Richland, WA 99352.  ATTENTION: Timothy Corbett.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Contract Delivery Service - Contracting Opportunities
<p>Contract Delivery Service is a contractual agreement between the U.S. Postal Service and an individual or company for the delivery and collection of mail. The typical service required at the local Post Office<sup>TM</sup> will involve sorting mail for the route, driving to the route, delivering mail and parcels to specified addresses, picking up collection mail, and returning to the Post Office. The contract route will operate six days per week, Monday through Saturday, with possible Sunday deliveries and may include holidays. The carrier is required to use their own vehicle for mail delivery service.</p>
<p>Contract Delivery Service carriers are not USPS employees but are independent contractors who provide service on specific routes. By becoming a contract delivery service supplier for the USPS, you sign on as an independent contractor who delivers and collects mail. You will not be an employee of the USPS, which means you won't be eligible for benefits.</p>
<p>You will be required to pass both a background check and a drug test before the USPS can consider you for a contract delivery service contract. Even though you will not be an actual employee, the USPS is a government agency; which means an extensive screening process is necessary. You also must be 21 years old to be considered for a contractor position.</p>
<p>Further reference, detailed instructions, and required documents are included in the solicitation attachments.</p>
<p>Good Luck...and we look forward to your interest in joining Contract Delivery Services.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

However, throughout the contract period of performance, there may be circumstances beyond the control of the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), that will impact normal days of business operation, such as inclement weather, power outages, etc. In circumstances such as these, the Contractor must call the appropriate NIST campus status line to verify the operating status:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM)</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days.

The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), anticipates the award of at least four indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts to provide fire protection engineering design, construction progress inspections, and acceptance testing of fire protection systems/equipment for facilities which support our mission worldwide.  These contracts are for design and/or inspection of construction projects.  This is not for any type of construction.  At least two of the four contracts will be awarded to a small business.<br /> <br />Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000 awarded over the life of each contract. The total amount of services awarded under each contract shall not exceed $3,000,000.00 per year.
<p>The contract is for the following services related to fire protection, fire alarm/detection, and life safety: Plan and specification review, shop drawing submittal review, hydraulic calculation review, fire alarm/detection system design, progress inspections of building construction to determine code/contract compliance, fire pump testing at factory prior to shipment overseas, final acceptance tests for fire/life safety systems, fire protection code analysis, fire modeling, exit modeling and custom programs.  Firms will be expected to perform fire protection testing as well as observe testing.<br />Tasks may involve travel to diplomatic posts, conducting facility, utility and infrastructure assessments.  <br />The following disciplines are required, at a minimum and are required to be licensed, if appropriate:  Fire Protection Engineer, Fire Protection Systems Technicians and Cost Estimating.<br />Security Clearance Requirement - IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD OF THIS CONTRACT, interested offerors must possess or be able to obtain a Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, formerly Defense Security Service (DSS), Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. At least two contracts will be awarded to firms possessing Interim or Final Top Secret FCLs, and one or more firms with Final Secret FCLs may be selected for additional award. Offerors, to include joint ventures, must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.</p>
<p>Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection of award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm(s) to obtain an Interim or Final Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract the selected offeror.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DCSA prior to performance on the contract.</p>
<p>If selected for an award at the Secret level, a joint venture comprised of entities cleared at the Secret level will be sponsored for a Secret FCL.&nbsp; A selected joint venture comprised of entities cleared at the Top Secret level will be sponsored for a Top Secret FCL.&nbsp; Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.&nbsp; If a joint venture FCL has not been issued within 45 days, the Government reserves the right to discontinue contract award proceedings and process the next highest offeror for contract award.</p>
<p><br />Selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 541, et seq.).<br />After short-listing by a Pre-Selection Board, firms may be required to make a presentation to the A/E Council (Selection Board) in Rosslyn, VA.<br />Firms which meet the requirements of this solicitation are invited to submit: two copies of Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications and two copies of a qualification statement, in Block H of the SF-330, addressing the evaluation factors listed below, one of which should contain an original signature.  Two CD's with all the information shall also be submitted. Firms responding to this announcement on or before the closing date shall be considered for selection.</p>
<p>Firms responding to this announcement on or before the closing date shall be considered for selection using the following evaluation criteria: <br /> <br />a)	Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. Organizational ability demonstrated through a written plan to assemble qualified teams consisting of the necessary disciplines to meet the contractual requirements. Such plans include a listing of permanent staff and letters of agreement to hire supplemental personnel if needed and copies of their professional resumes. The project manager proposed must be currently employed by the offeror. The staffing table shall provide details for staffing the following labor categories; Project Manager, Fire Protection Engineer, Fire Alarm Technician, Fire Protection Systems Technician, Fire Protection Specialist.</p>
<p>b)	Specialized recent experience, within the last three years, and technical competence in fire protection engineering services.

<p>For each project identified in the responses to the foregoing evaluation criteria, provide the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of a client representative and identify which members of the proposed team participated on the project.</p>
<p>Failure to address each of the evaluation criteria, in writing, will result in failure to qualify.  Additionally, failure to provide the requisite information will result in failure to qualify.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals.  Since a contract may result in an award over $3,000,000.00, large businesses will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award.  The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System Code is 541330.</p>
<p>Firms responding to this announcement must specifically address each of the above factors under separate headings.

This Request for Proposals (RFP) describes the goods and services being requested and provides instructions on how to respond. Proposals are due no later than November 18, 2019 at 11:00 AM ET.
<p>The RFP describes the products/services being requested and provides instructions on how to respond. Further details provided herein. Proposals shall be submitted no later than November 18, 2019 at 11:00 AM ET. The RFP is available electronically at http://www.usac.org/about/tools/procurement.</p>
<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation issued in accordance with Part 13 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (known as the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR)). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; no separate written solicitation will be issued. The solicitation number is HC-19-112. Proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. No additional notification will be issued by the FCC. ALL COMMUNICATIONS IN REFERENCE TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES SHALL BE THROUGH USAC'S Contracting Office. The RFP describes the services requested and provides instructions on how to respond. BACKGROUND: USAC is a not-for-profit Delaware corporation. The FCC has appointed USAC as the permanent administrator of the Universal Service Fund (USF) and the universal service support mechanisms (Support Mechanisms): High Cost (HC), Lifeline (LI), Rural Health Care (RHC) and Schools &amp; Libraries (SL) as set forth in Title 47, Part 54, Section 701 of the Code of Federal Regulations. As part of its administrative function, USAC performs, subject to FCC oversight, the billing, collection, and disbursement functions associated with the USF and the Support Mechanisms.

<p>The purpose of this RFP is to seek proposals from US-based companies for consulting services from a contractor with substantial and demonstrable Program Management Office (PMO) experience to support the establishment of systems for Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DODC). The DODC will collect geospatial data on broadband availability from broadband providers and "crowdsourced" data from government entities and the general public who dispute the broadband availability data.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 
Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. 
The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p><strong>PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE SYNOPSIS AND ATTACHED DOCUMENTS BEFORE PROVIDING A RESPONSE</strong>.</p>
<p>1) Description of Services: In December 2018, MCC signed a $600 million Compact with the Government of Senegal (GoS) of which $50 million is the Government of Senegal contribution. The Compact is expected to enter into force in mid-2020. The Compact aims to address the high cost of energy, a binding constraint to economic growth in Senegal. The compact development teams further defined this constraint as the high cost of electricity to grid-connected firms, low access to electricity outside of Dakar, and to a lesser extent, the unreliability of electricity, which reduces firms' cost-effectiveness by increasing costs and uncertainty of production. The Compact consists of three projects:</p>
<p>a.Modernizing and Strengthening Senelec's Transmission Network ("Transmission Project)<br />b.Increasing Access to Electricity in Rural and Peri-Urban Areas ("Access Project")<br />c.Power Sector Enabling Environment and Capacity Development ("Reform Project").</p>
<p>Annex III of the Compact provides a summary of the Compact's monitoring and evaluation approach and serves as the basis for the M&amp;E plan, which is to be completed within 90 days of entry into force. The M&amp;E Division of the MCC's Department of Policy and Evaluation is seeking a consultant to assist in a number of monitoring and evaluation tasks related to the development of the Compact's M&amp;E plan.</p>
<p>2) This combined synopsis and solicitation notice is a request for competitive quotations. Therefore, all quotations received prior to the RFQ close date/time will be considered.</p>
<p>3) The Government will award an order to the responsible independent consultant(s) whose quote conforming to this notice represents the best value in terms of technical criteria, past performance and price. All non-price factors (technical criteria and past performance) are more important than price. If options are included, quotes will be evaluated by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. This includes options under FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation. Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the price(s) offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option, which will be added to the base and other option periods to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>4) Quote Submission. The Independent Consultant shall submit the following documents, written in English:</p>
<p>a. Technical: <br />I. Cover letter that addresses each of the evaluation factors listed in Section 10; and<br />ii. Curriculum Vitae (5 page maximum).</p>

<p>NIST LOCAL-53 CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING CHANGES IN NIST OPERATING STATUS <br />Unless otherwise stated in the contract terms and conditions, normal days of business operation are Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Holidays. However, throughout the contract period of performance, there may be circumstances beyond the control of the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), that will impact normal days of business operation, such as inclement weather, power outages, etc. In circumstances such as these, the Contractor must call the appropriate NIST campus status line to verify the operating status:</p>
<p>Gaithersburg Campus Operating Status Line: <br />(301) 975-8000<br />(800) 437-4385 x8000 (toll free)</p>

<p>During a lapse in appropriation, access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited to excepted personnel for both Federal employees and Contractor personnel. If performance of the contract is onsite and/or requires Government interaction, unless you have been, or are notified that you are to work under an excepted status, you will automatically enter a temporary work stoppage. The work stoppage shall remain in effect until the lapse is resolved and notification is provided via the NIST website at https://www.nist.gov/ and/or the NIST operating status lines. Additionally, contractors are encouraged to monitor public broadcasts or the Office of Personnel Management's website at www.opm.gov for the Federal Government operating status.</p>
<p>NIST will provide notification to all contractors that are determined to have excepted status. All excepted contractors are required to continue performance and communicate with the appointed Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for further guidance, or NIST Contracting Officer if a COR is not appointed.</p>
<p>Contractors with supply or service contracts that are fully funded at the time of contract award and do not require access to Government facilities, resources, or active administration by Government personnel in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue performance.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification #2:</span></strong>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong></div>
<div>Q1: Would you please clarify the answer below, and if the grantee expects the applicants to submit the high-level results (1) as part of their response, (2) after they submit the response, but before USTDA will select the awardee, or (3) after USTDA selects the awardee and before the contract will be fully executed.</div>
<div><br />A1: The applicants could submit the detailed high-level results after the contract is fully executed. To the extent possible, Offerors should be prepared to submit preliminary results of their analysis as soon as possible following contract execution and kick-off.</div>
<div><br />Q2: At the bottom of the RFP page 12 and top of page 13, there is a discussion regarding timing, which concludes draft results and "solid supporting information" must be available before November 2019. Is this still accurate? By what date in November? By when do you anticipate making the award and selecting a contractor to perform this study? If the date is no longer accurate, by when are the draft results needed?</div>
<div><br />A2: Offerors should be prepared to submit preliminary analysis as soon as possible following contract execution.</div>
<div><br />Q3. RE: Section 3.4 TECHNICAL APPROACH AND WORK PLAN<br />Paragraph 4 - Please confirm the Contractor support described in this paragraph is part of the TOR referenced in Annex 5 and indicate which task this work shall be included; note the supporting information and analysis requested by November 2019 will not be available until completion of the study as referenced in the last sentence of the Objective paragraph in the Terms of Reference: "The Study will confirm the technical and economic feasibility of the Project prior to the Grantee's signing of a power purchase agreement ("PPA") with Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand ("EGAT")</div>
<div><br />A3: Successful Offeror will be requested to submit preliminary analysis as soon as possible following execution of the contract. At this stage, the Offerors could conduct economic and technical high-level analysis that take only a few main parameters into account to assess CAPEX, energy production, revenue, OPEX and technical stability. Full-detail technical and economic feasibility study would be submitted at the completion of the Study.</div>
<div><br />Q4. RE: Submission Deadline<br />Due to the requirements of the RFP to provide Subcontractor firm information for local subcontractors and the time required to engage said subcontractor, the Contractor kindly requests an extension to provide our proposal on November 15, 2019.</div>
<div><br />A4: No extension requests will be granted for the electronic submission. However, the Grantee is willing to allow receipt of hard copies up to one (1) week following the electronic submission deadline. Please review the amended RFP for full details on this change.</div>
<div><br />Q5: RE: Follow-on work<br />If a company were to win the feasibility study, is there a policy either from USTDA or the client that would prohibit that same company from winning any follow-on work?</div>
<div><br />A5: No USTDA or Grantee policy exists that would prohibit the firm performing the feasibility study rom bidding on follow-on work.</div>
<div><br />Q6. RE: Published List<br />Will USTDA publish the list of companies who bid on the feasibility study?</div>
<div><br />A6: Only companies who "opt in" when requesting the RFP from USTDA are included in the public list of Offerors.<br /><br /></div>

<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP)/SOLICITATION.<br /> <br />Proposals in response to this RFP are due by 2:00 PM EST on Wednesday, 20 November 2019.
<p>The AFICC Roofing Repair, Replacement, and Maintenance (R3M) enterprise sourcing effort will provide for a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle for the Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC) that will provide acquisition for roofing requirements for roof replacement, preventative maintenance, corrective repair, and inspection/testing services over a five (5) year ordering period (no options) to both Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Alaska installations.</p>
<p>This acquisition is set-aside 100% for Small Business (SB) concerns. Offerors must meet the size standard of equal to or less than $16.5 million dollars that is associated with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition of 238160, Roofing Contractors. An Offeror's SB status will be verified using the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov/SAM). All prospective Offerors must be actively registered in SAM with no active exclusions in order to be eligible for award IAW FAR 4.1102 and 9.4.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation Subpart 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3 Source Selection, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures (MP) 5315.3.</p>
<p>The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) memorandum, dated December 13, 2017, SUBJECT: Class Deviation 2018-O0006 - Evaluation Factors for Certain Multiple-Award Task- or Delivery- Order Contracts, authorizes Contracting Officers when issuing a solicitation that will result in multiple-award contracts issued for the same or similar services, may exclude price or cost as an evaluation factor for the contract awards, if the solicitation states that the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors. The Contracting Officer shall consider price or cost as one of the factors in the selection decision for each task or delivery order under the multiple-award contract IAW FAR 16.505.</p>
<p>Therefore, the team is calling this new approach the Exclusion of Price In Competition (EPIC) source selection method. The method is simpler than lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) and intends for award to each and all qualifying offerors. A qualifying offeror, per the deviation, is an offeror that is determined to be a responsible source, submits a technically acceptable proposal that conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, and that the contracting officer has no reason to believe would be likely to offer other than fair and reasonable pricing.</p>
<p>Offerors must submit questions or concerns in writing via e-mail to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) and Contract Specialist (CS) indicated in the RFP no later than 2:00 PM EST on 08 Nov 2019. Questions submitted after this date may not be answered. A question and answer (Q&amp;A) document will be posted in the same location as this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation notice within a few days of the question due date listed herein for all potential Offerors to view.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay and/or reimburse respondents and/or their associates for any cost incurred to submit the requested information and/or proposal. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an Offeror for any costs.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government desires to procure a Job Order Contract (JOC) at Fort Drum, NY on a small business set-aside basis, provided 2 or more qualified small businesses respond to this sources sought synopsis with information sufficient to support a set-aside. Be advised that the U.S. Government will not be able to set aside this requirement if 2 or more small businesses do not respond with information to support the set-aside. We encourage all small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement at a fair market price.</p>
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or IFB or RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The anticipated NAICS code(s) is/are: 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, size standard is $39.5M.</p>
<p>A continuing need is anticipated for a JOC, which is currently being fulfilled through current contract # W911S2-17-D-8000.</p>
<p>A Job Order Contract is an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract which is awarded on the basis of full and open competition and effective competition and is used to execute sustainment, restoration and modernization projects at installation (post, camp, or station) level. The JOC includes a comprehensive collection of detailed repair, maintenance and minor construction task descriptions or specifications, units of measure and pre-established unit prices for each of these discrete tasks. Each project or job ordered under a JOC is normally comprised of a number of pre-described and pre-priced tasks.</p>
<p>Interested concerns should be aware of FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (JAN 2019)(Deviation 2019-O0003)</p>
<p>(a) This clause does not apply to the unrestricted portion of a partial set-aside.<br />(b) Definition. As used in this clause-<br />"Similarly situated entity" means a first-tier subcontractor, including an independent<br />contractor, that has the same small business program status as that which qualified the prime contractor for the award and that is considered small for the NAICS code the prime contractor assigned to the subcontract the subcontractor will perform. An example of a similarly situated entity is a first-tier subcontractor that is a HUBZone small business concern for a HUBZone setaside or sole source award under the HUBZone Program.<br />(c) Applicability. This clause applies only to-<br />(1) Contracts that have been set aside or reserved for small business concerns or 8(a)<br />participants;<br />(2) Part or parts of a multiple-award contract that have been set aside for small business concerns or 8(a) participants; and<br />(3) Orders set aside for small business or 8(a) participants under multiple-award contracts as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).<br />(d) Independent contractors. An independent contractor shall be considered a subcontractor.<br />(e) Agreement. By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for-<br />(1) Services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count toward the 50 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded;<br />(2) Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), it will not pay more than 50 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count toward the 50 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded;<br />(3) General construction, it will not pay more than 85 percent of the amount paid by the<br />Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count toward the 85 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded; or<br />(4) Construction by special trade contractors, it will not pay more than 75 percent of the<br />amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count toward the 75 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded.<br />(f) A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (e) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry Center (RRC) services (in-house RRC beds) and Home Confinement services (home confinement placements) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes located within the county of Onondaga County, New York.
<p><br />Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, April 2017, Revision 1 - April 2019".</p>
<p>This will be for an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract with firm fixed unit prices.</p>
<p>The RRC In-House requirement will consist of a guaranteed minimum of 11 beds in which 10 will be designated for males and 1 will be designated for females and a maximum of 36 beds in which 32 beds will be designated for males and 4 beds designated for females for the One-year Base Period and each of the Four One-year Option Periods.</p>
<p>The Home Confinement requirement will consist of a guaranteed minimum of 2 placements and a maximum of 8 placements to include both males and females for the One-year Base Period and each of the Four One-year Option Periods.</p>
<p>The Home Confinement Radius will be within 100 miles of the facility.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>15BRRC20R00000264 will be available on or about October 21, 2019, and it will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions. Future information about this acquisition will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The estimated closing date of 15BRRC20R00000264 will be on or about December 19, 2019.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by this agency. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone request or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0001 Summary:

Amendment 0001 hereby extends the quote submission due date to 07 November, 2019 at 2:00 PM Mountain Time (MST).

Amendment 0001 hereby incorporates the following documents:
1. Questions and Answers (2)

All other dates remain unchanged.



This is a Request for Quote (RFQ). The Department of Energy/Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) has a requirement to replace the current Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Energy Management System (EMS) for grid control across all WAPA regions with a Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) software solution and integration from a single vendor. The initial anticipated award will cover the purchase of software licensing, as well as, implementation and training for the integrated SCADA/EMS solutions in a single WAPA region. It is anticipated subsequent follow-on awards will be made for the remaining regions once funding is available in future fiscal years. This requirement is a continuation and result of Request for Information (RFI) # 89503419NWA000004 posted to FedConnect (https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/?doc=89503419NWA000004&agency=DOE)

The Government intends to acquire commercial software licenses and services using the provisions, clauses, and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, specifically FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items. This is a full and open requirement.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511, and the size standard is $27.5 million dollars. It is anticipated this action will result in a firm-fixed-price contract and the period of performance for the initial award and single regional implementation will be between one and two years depending on the region selected for implementation. The Government intends to award to the responsible contractor whose quote is determined to be the best value to the Government based upon technical excellence, price, and past performance.

All questions submitted by vendors along with their corresponding answers will be posted publically on FBO and FedConnect as necessary.

In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<p><strong>Background Information:</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) is to conduct state-of-the-art research on basic mechanisms that underlie substance-use disorders (SUDs) and to develop new treatments.  Research is supported at the molecular, genetic, cellular, animal, and clinical levels and is conceptually integrated, highly innovative, and focused on major problems in the field. The long-term goal of the research is to better understand the biological and behavioral factors contributing to initiation, maintenance, and resolution of SUDs (and associated diseases), and to translate this knowledge into strategies for prevention, treatment, and reduction of negative consequences, at both the individual and societal levels.</p>
<p>Using volunteer human participants, the IRP clinical program conducts residential and nonresidential studies that interrelate with preclinical laboratory investigations.  In general, human research at the IRP assesses physiological, behavioral, and psychosocial concomitants of drug use and SUDs, seeks ways to predict outcome, and tests new treatments. <br /> <br /><strong> Requirement Objectives: </strong></p>
<p>NIDA IRP needs outreach-based support services for participant recruitment (advertising, local-provider networking, a call center) and on-site services for medical screening and remuneration.  We have generally gotten this range of services from a single contractor.</p>
<p>Recruitment data are stored in an electronic clinical-records system, the Human Research Information System, (HuRIS).  HuRIS is on a secure network, but accessible remotely through VPN access to NIH servers.</p>
<p>The IRP normally has 10-20 active research studies at a given time.  These are written by NIDA investigators and undergo NIH scientific review, IRB review, and FDA review as needed.  The majority of the studies recruit adults between the ages of 18 and 75; a few studies may enroll people under 18.  Studies require specific populations to be targeted based on varying Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and may include people with active SUDs (including cigarette smokers), occasional users, and healthy controls.</p>
<p>One requirement will be project-management support to ensure adequate and flexible staffing expertise and any supervision of that staff as necessary for smooth daily operations of recruitment, screening, and remuneration activities.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong><br />The recruitment process includes various modalities for advertising, including traditional print, radio, and television ads, but also new-media advertising and community outreach.  All recruitment campaigns need to include real-time monitoring and optimization plans. A software platform for integrating and monitoring success of advertising and enrollment data may need to be developed or integrated into our current medical record.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach<br /></strong>Grassroots community outreach is needed to provide awareness and establish trust within the community regarding research studies in general and NIDA specifically.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phone Screening<br /></strong>The NIDA IRP prescreens potential study participants by telephone.  The telephone interviews use IRB-approved scripted language.  Data from the interviews need to be accurately and quickly entered into our HuRIS clinical-record system.  Currently we conduct approximately 40 phone screens per day.  Bidders should be prepared with a plan to handle significant volume increases due to improved call rates.</p>
<p><strong>Onsite Screening&nbsp;<br /></strong>Almost all our studies require onsite screening, which, in turn, requires flexible staffing hours.  Informed consent must precede any onsite screening.  Depending on the protocol, onsite screening takes six to eight hours per person and is often conducted across several days.  Approximately 100 initial and 100 follow-up appointments are scheduled each month.</p>
<p>The onsite screening process requires coordination with NIDA IRP staff, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and physicians.  The contractor would provide expertise in obtaining psychiatric and other medical information via interviews and basic medical assessments such as obtaining vital signs, drawing blood, performing ECGs, monitoring breath for alcohol and carbon monoxide, and testing urine for pregnancy and for drugs of abuse.  The Contractor will also supply the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waiver testing kits needed for pregnancy, HIV, and urine testing for drugs of abuse.</p>
<p>All in-person screening information is documented in our HuRIS system in real time. Computer proficiency is necessary.</p>
<p><strong> Participant Remuneration (including travel)</strong>&nbsp;<br />Each protocol specifies the amount and method of remuneration and travel options, in accordance with NIH policies.  While most protocols remunerate in cash, participant may receive checks, have bills paid on their behalf, be given gift cards, online payments, etc.  NIDA could consider additional methods of payment.  A system for chain of custody will be needed and must reconcile with remuneration tracking in HuRIS.  NIDA has an approved overnight facility for studies that need it.  Many studies do not require overnight stay but will provide travel reimbursement or travel arrangements.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government Furnished Property (GFP) <br />The Government provides onsite contractor employees with computers, telephones, desks, chairs, lights, and software for the purposes of maintaining electronic records and running the call center.  The Government also provides limited staff for screening activities, including medical oversight, nurses, and physician assistants. All physicians and scientists are federal employees.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking interested sources for the requirement entitled:

MEDICAL SURGICAL, BARIATRIC, HOSPTIAL BEDS/MATTRESSES


THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR
PROPOSAL OR QUOTE. THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IS NOT SEEKING
PRICING OR OFFERS OF ANY KIND.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting market research to ascertain if there are potential business sources capable of providing hospital beds and mattresses to VA medical facilities. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. The medical products to be supplied include, but are not limited to Medical Surgical Beds, Bariatric Medical Surgical Beds, and Hospital Mattresses for both Medical Surgical and Bariatric beds. 

If a contract is awarded, the selected vendor(s) will provide Medical Surgical & Bariatric Medical Surgical bed frames and Compatible Mattresses for an estimated thirty-eight (38) facilities located in Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISNs) 10, 12, 15, and 23 (See Attachment 1 - Facility Locations and Estimates). The selected vendor(s) will be responsible for providing all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision facilities, transportation and other items/services necessary to perform this requirement in its entirety.

The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research and obtain information from qualified vendors with special interest. No solicitation is being issued at this time. All responses must be received by Friday, October 25th, 2019 by no later than 1:00PM (CST) to the point of contacts listed below. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. 

Respondents may be contacted to present their capabilities and interact with logistic and clinical staff for an Industry Day Session as described in Attachment 3 (Industry Day Session).  PLEASE NOTE: Only vendors who respond to RFI number 36C77620Q0006 shall be considered for an invitation to participate in a potential Industry Day Session. Attendance/participation at a particular Industry Day Session is not a prerequisite for participation in responding to this RFI or any solicitation that may eventually result from the session or response to this RFI. Further, Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) reserves the right to invite some, all or none of the RFI respondents to the potential Industry Day Session.

This RFI is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e) as part of market research as a forum to discuss with small and large businesses and to obtain feedback on acquisition strategies related to the PCAC Strategic Sourcing of Medical Surgical & Bariatric Medical Surgical Hospital Beds and Compatible Mattresses. PCAC Strategic Sourcing welcomes all valuable input from the industry with expertise in and knowledge for implementation and management of providing the various products needed to satisfy this requirement.

Interested vendors are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.12, prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with FAR 4.11 required registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to the award of a contract. 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) has issued a  non-manufacturing  waiver for NAICS code 339113. To make an appropriate acquisition decision for this requirement, the Government will use the response to this RFI. The type of solicitation to be issued and the manner of advertisement will also depend on the response to this RFI. To be considered a SDVOSB/VOSB concern, offerors must be registered and verified in www.vip.vetbiz.gov. 

Any questions regarding this RFI shall be sent via email to lenny.flagg@va.gov by close of business October 15, 2019.

Please include  10, 12, 15, and 23 Hospital Beds  in the subject line of all correspondence. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Responses received after the specified date and time will not be considered.

This RFI contains four (4) attachments: Attachment 1   Facility Locations and Estimates, Attachment 2   Salient Characteristics, Attachment 3   Industry Day Session, Attachment 4   Capability Assessment Questionnaire. Attachment 1, Facility Locations and Estimates, contains locations with estimated maximum/minimum quantities per location.

Attachment 3, Industry Day Session, is a vendor show that allows respondents to present their capabilities, as stated in paragraph (4). Attachment 4, Capability Assessment Questionnaire, contains a list of questions that will be used to assist the Government in determining the capabilities of each vendor.

<AWARDEE>Demo Project, 5755 Granger Rd STE 110, independence, OH 44131 US
<DESC>The project is located at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB), Washington DC. This project encompasses the demolition of sites that have been designated by base command to be demolished due to vacancy, deterioration, and absence of planned usage. These facilities are in structural disrepair, are weathered, have major roof leaks, suffer severe flooding, and may have major infestation issues. Each of the designated buildings, sheds,&nbsp; and storage spaces are no longer useful in their present condition and need to be demolished and removed. The base of this project entails the demolition and disposal of building 502, as well as sheds 2016, 2125, and 2130. Other options on this project are detailed in this Scope of Work (SOW). Due to the age of the structures, abatement protocols of lead and asbestos containing materials will be in effect. All project areas will be returned to grass via grading and reseeding, as well as all areas disturbed by construction activity, except where otherwise specified. <br />JBAB has 72 sheds of various sizes throughout the installation. All sheds are unconditioned. The facilities are excess storage capacity and attract long term storage and eventual abandonment of excess supplies, particularly if they are located in a remote location or not near the tenant's primary facility. <br />
