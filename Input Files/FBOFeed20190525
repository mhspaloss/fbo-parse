<CONTACT>Young, Anale
<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE TO INFORM INTERESTED PARTIES OF AN UPCOMING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DREDGING OF HISTORIC PONDS AT KENILWORTH PARK & AQUATIC GARDENS, LOCATED IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  NO AWARD WILL BE MADE FROM THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME FOR THIS NOTICE. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

THIS REQUIREMENT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.


This upcoming requirement shall be for the restoration of the healthy water depth for select ponds that have become filled in with sediment due to tidal fluctuations at Kenilworth Park & Aquatic Gardens. The ponds require regular dredging to maintain the site as a functioning aquatic garden which, unfortunately, has not been conducted in approximately 10 years and the current accumulated sediment is an imminent threat to the health of the resource. Long term functionality of the site requires that water depth in the ponds be maintained through improved drainage and control of appropriate pond water levels. 

Seasonal and environmental impacts such as, but not limited to, weather, visitation, and wildlife warrant the period of performance to be anticipated for approximately 180 days between September 2019 - December 2019.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Logistics Directorate contracting branch (SMC/PKL) located at Peterson AFB, Colorado, is contemplating acquisition and award of a single contract for engineering support of Combined Orbital Operations, Logistics, and Resiliency (COOLR). The Government intends to award an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a one-year base period with nine one-year options periods. If all options are exercised, the period of performance would be from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 December 2019 through 30 November 2029</span>.</p>
<p>The Government requires life cycle logistics support for the sustainment of the Milstar, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) III MILSATCOM systems. The COOLR effort will include bus and payload software/hardware sustaining engineering, software and database sustainment, ground hardware sustainment, on-orbit satellite operations and sustainment support, infrastructure support, Systems Engineering, Integration and Test (SEIT), operational resiliency (space-related and system), cybersecurity resiliency (defensive cybersecurity), operations assurance, and AEHF/Milstar technical data services.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Notice of Contracting Action (NOCA) is to announce the Government's intention to pursue a Sole Source procurement for Combined Orbital Operations, Logistics, and Resiliency (COOLR). This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government to further evaluate capability briefs, release a competitive solicitation, or award a contract. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.</p>
<p>A subsequent Request for Proposal is expected to be sent to:</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin Corporation<br />1111 Lockheed Martin Way<br />Sunnyvale, CA 94089<br />Meredith Srnec<br />303-977-2745</p>
<p>Based on market research, the Government has an approved justification to acquire these services on a sole source basis. A resulting contract will be awarded under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2) as Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency's requirements. This notice of intent is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>A sources sought synopsis was posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) on 15 March 2018 a, titled Combined Orbital Operations, Logistics, and Resiliency (COOLR), which was used for market research and the justification to acquire these services sole source. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 with a size standard of $38.5M annually. The Service Code is: R425 Engineering and Technical Services.</p>
<p>Only one firm provided a statement of capability in response to the FBO sources sought posting. Based on the technical assessment of the market research, it was determined only Lockheed Martin Corporation could meet all of the Government's critical requirements associated with the overall effort.</p>
<p>If the Government elects to do so, a projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is estimated to be no sooner than 15 calendar days after this Notice of Contract Action and will be directed solely to the prospective source identified above. The projected RFP release date for this effort is June 2019.</p>
<p>The estimated IDIQ award date is first quarter Fiscal Year 2020. The following contract types are anticipated to be utilized within respective task orders: Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), and Cost Reimbursable (CR).</p>
<p>The notice expires 15 days after publication.</p>

<p>As you know, tariffs for items from China, were increased last Friday to 25%. We plan to quote the items listed to include this level of tariff, however if the tariff is decreased, we will pass that decrease on to you, our customer. How would you like us to handle that on our proposal? <br />A: If there is a decrease then you would (if awarded the contract) inform the Contracting Officer of the price change and a modification to contract would be done.</p>

<p>Item #4 - Super Sipper Bottle with Straw. The solicitation requests a clear straw, however the item specified comes with a same-colored straw as the cup.

<p>Item #5 - Tote Bag with Zipper. Would you like pricing for Silk Screened or Embroidery decoration on this item?<br />A: Silk screened.</p>
<p>Q: Questions</p>
