<DESC>Project Number 689-17-102; Inpatient Pharmacy IV Corrections: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This announcement is seeking interested sources, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of industry, namely Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Small Businesses (SB) and Large Businesses (LB). 

The project shall be a complete renovation of the area located in Building 1 Ground Floor at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System in West Haven, CT. The pharmacy to be renovated is approximately 1,410 square feet. Work shall include architectural, structural, plumbing, mechanical, electrical, IT, and all other systems as necessary to completely renovate this space to meet the project objectives. The VA Project Number and Title is 689-17-102, Inpatient Pharmacy IV Corrections. Contractor shall provide the demolition and removal of existing structures, relocation of existing owners equipment, construction of new spaces and furnish labor and materials and perform work for the renovation and replacement of existing pharmacy space located at the West Haven VA Medical Center in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions, specifications and drawings, and applicable wage rates. 

The main goal of this project is to address the requirement for the VA to meet United States Pharmacopeia Chapter 800 (USP-800) compliance. The results of which shall include all new walls, ceilings, floors, layouts, HVAC systems, lighting, power, plumbing and fire protections.

Because the area is not fed by the main plant steam and chilled water systems, the new HVAC system shall be self-contained and include DX cooling and gas heating. This will lend itself to allowing the area to operate year-round without any temporary shutdowns due to environmental restrictions. Additionally, a redundant HVAC system is being designed to allow for proper maintenance and stand-by operations to insure the most reliable on-time performance.

The main area of renovation is required to have a 100% outdoor air supply and exhaust. No recirculation of the air system is allowed. Additional, very specific pressure relationships must be maintained in order to meet USP-800 compliance.

The standalone HVAC system will be designed to integrate with the central campus BMS and controls systems.

All work shall be done in accordance with VA specifications and design guides, NFPA, NEC, USP-800 and all other applicable code requirements.

The contractor shall assume that the majority portion of work will be performed outside of regular working hours (6:00 am   7:00 pm).

The total project schedule is anticipated to be 9 months. It is expected that the contractor shall use the initial two months to perform field inspections and verifications, complete submittals including coordination submittals and to order all long lead items to ensure their timely delivery. It is expected that the contractor shall use the last month for final closeout and documentation. Therefore, is expected that the construction period and significant onsite activity will take place in the remaining 6 month period.

Interested parties meeting the requirements of this notice must address the information below in their response. 

Limitations on Subcontracting, the prime contractor must perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees for general construction-type procurements.
