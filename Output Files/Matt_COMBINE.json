The Reservoir is one of seven reservoirs that comprise the Cutzamala System (\"System\"), the largest single source of water for the greater Mexico City Metropolitan Area, providing approximately 24 percent of the potable water to city's 21.3 million inhabitants.  The Reservoir comprises an estimated 35 percent of the System's total water supply and has a storage capacity of approximately 394 billion liters of water.  Due to erosion and sedimentation, the Reservoir's storage capacity has reduced by approximately 21 percent since it was originally constructed in 1947.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to this reduction, the combination of erosion, sedimentation, and increased human activity (e.g. deforestation, fertilization, effluent from livestock, and municipal and industrial discharges) have led to the introduction of high concentrations of nutrients, such as nitrates, phosphates, iron, and silica into the Reservoir.  The high nutrient concentration has prompted a damaging eutrophication process at the Reservoir, resulting in the development of large quantities of algae and plant life that diminish oxygen in the water and hinder the Reservoir's function as a source of drinking water to the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.  As a direct consequence, water originating from the Reservoir has put additional technological and cost stains on the System's water treatment processes.</p>\r\n<p>The objective of the Valle de Bravo Water Quality Improvement Project Technical Assistance is to provide early-stage support in deploying SuperOxygenation units at two sites located in the Reservoir.  The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $530,756 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (\"USTDA\").</p>\r\n<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (\"RFP\"), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209.

While the country has made some progress over the last decade, it still faces a difficult business climate that is constraining broad-based private sector development. Without private sector-led, broad-based inclusive, economic growth and development, the prospects of addressing high unemployment and poverty will be limited. Improving the business climate will not only require reforming key policies, but also enhancing technical capacity within the government to develop and lead such reforms. USAID envisages that this activity will both seek to work on key issues affecting the business climate and the establishment/strengthening of capacities within the government. Its focus will be the promotion of reforms to reduce transaction costs and corruption, improve trade facilitation, increase liquidity in the rural sector and promote exports in value-added products. This activity is expected to work on policies centered on port improvements, establishment of viable special economic zones, streamlining of concession processes and technical capacity-building within the government to undertake policy analysis, design and implementation. While USAID will lead this effort, it expects to enlist the support of other development partners in close consultation with the GOL. The main driver for this effort will be the appetite and desire of the GOL to prioritize these reforms and capacity-building in economic policy-making.</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/AID/OM/LIB/72066919R00005/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"LR","POPADDRESS":"U.S. Agency for International Development\r\nc/o US Embassy Monrovia \r\n502 Benson St.\r\n1000 Monrovia, 10 Liberia\r\n\nMonrovia, 1"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0121","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Department of the Army","OFFICE":"Army Contracting Command, CSBs","LOCATION":"ACC-AFG (W91B4N) RCC-AFG","ZIP":"09354","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"541330","OFFADD":"APO APO AE 1 09354","SUBJECT":"ASG Contracted Public Works","SOLNBR":"W91B4N-19-R-5000","RESPDATE":"021019","CONTACT":"Brenda Simmons, Contract Specialist, Phone DSN: 318-481-8893, Email brenda.n.simmons.ctr@mail.mil - Benjamin Wells, Contracting Officer, Phone DSN: 318-481-8893, Email centcom.bagram.usfor-a.mbx.rcc-a-service-team-2@mail.mil","DESC":"The Regional Contracting Center-Afghanistan (RCC-A) Army Contracting Command-Afghanistan (ACC-A) has a requirement for professional and technical services in support of Area Support Group-Afghanistan (ASG-A) public works mission in the following areas: electrical, plumbing, carpentry, HVAC services, welding, and generator maintenance services.

What key attributes are Chinese smart cities expected to contain and what role are smart cities expected to play in China's development strategies? How do smart cities align with China's domestic security, industrial policy, and foreign policy objectives? How does the central government coordinate smart city development, and what role do local governments play in rolling out the concept? Identify environmental, mass transit, water infrastructure, broadband/5G, surveillance, and other objectives for smart city development.</p>\r\n<p>2.\tDescribe China's development of smart cities, particularly key enabling technologies including 5G, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, and block chain.  How is the government (central and local) funding the development of smart cities? What kind of support (financial, regulatory, etc.) has the Chinese government provided to its domestic firms, research institutes, and universities? How successful have those efforts been? What are the challenges to enhancing those capabilities? What cooperative development programs for smart cities has China engaged in or announced with foreign entities (governmental, business, or academic)?</p>\r\n<p>3.\tAssess China's application of mass surveillance in smart cities. To what extent are smart city technologies enabling mass surveillance? Does China's application of mass surveillance in smart cities differ from other countries?</p>\r\n<p>4.\tEvaluate U.S. capabilities and China's in development and deployment of smart city technologies. In which technologies and applications has China gained an edge, and how? How is this competitive landscape likely to evolve in the next 5-10 years? What are the implications for U.S. global competitiveness and national security? How should the U.S. government and U.S. Congress mitigate the security and privacy risks and improve U.S. economic competitiveness in smart cities?</p>\r\n<p>5.\tDescribe China's promotion of its smart city technologies abroad. What tools has the Chinese government used to promote Chinese technologies, standards, and concept of smart cities abroad, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative? Where is initial deployment occurring, and how effective have these efforts been? What future plans has the Chinese government announced? What are the implications for U.S. foreign policy objectives, national security, and global competitiveness?</p>\r\n<p>6.\tEvaluate the role of Chinese products in U.S. smart city critical infrastructure. How reliant are the U.S. local and municipal governments and providers of critical infrastructure and services (e.g., port authorities, emergency responders) on Chinese firms and Chinese-made products and services? What are the potential vulnerabilities from U.S. usage of Chinese-designed or -manufactured technologies in U.S. smart cities to U.S. economic health, national security, democracy, privacy, and supply chain integrity? Are these risks unique to Chinese-designed or -manufactured technologies? How are local and municipal governments addressing those risks? Are there any standards or protocols that exist to promote proper security protocols regarding deployment of products/services for smart cities?  What are the types and volume of data Chinese firms are collecting or are capable of collecting from products and services they provide to U.S. smart cities?

Briefly describe China's space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, including its ocean surveillance network, and its near-, medium-, and long-term objectives to enhance its space-based ISR network. How do these assets enable or enhance the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) ability to operate at greater distances from the Chinese mainland, and how will these capabilities improve in the future? Assess China's kinetic and non-kinetic ground- and space-based counterspace capabilities, including a discussion of how these could be employed to target U.S. space assets or those of U.S. allies and partners. How is China seeking to improve its space situational awareness capabilities, and what is the status of China's space-based early warning capabilities? What are the trends in China's use of space-based communications, and what are its plans to use microsatellites and other technologies to enhance the survivability of its ISR and communications constellations? Describe any tests or concepts that China has explored for spaceplanes, space-to-air vehicles, and space-to-ground weapons programs.</p>\r\n<p>2.\tAssess China's progress in operationalizing its military space and counterspace programs since the establishment of the PLA Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015. Identify the SSF's operational space units and assess current and future trends in their operational status, including their integration into the PLA's training cycle. Describe how, if at all, the re-subordination of most military space programs under the SSF has impacted China's counterspace and space launch capabilities and how these capabilities could develop in the future. Assess the impact of China's current military reorganization and reform efforts on its ability to realize its space ambitions. Assess the SSF's ability to conduct both kinetic and non-kinetic counterspace activities by 2020 and 2035.</p>\r\n<p>3.\tAssess the PLA's success in leveraging China's civilian space capabilities and research and development (R&amp;D) programs to support its development of operational capabilities. What role have China's aerospace defense conglomerates and civilian space industry played in building its military space program, as is outlined in China's military-civilian fusion strategy? How has the PLA harnessed research benefits from China's lunar exploration program, including its activities on the far side of the moon? Assess China's dual-use communications and jamming capabilities in deep space. How dependent is China's space program on global supply chains and foreign technology or deemed exports, overseas R&amp;D collaboration (in particular with the United States and U.S. allies and partners), and overseas support infrastructure? Have any notable exchanges occurred between U.S. and Chinese entities that were either in violation of legal restrictions on U.S.-China cooperation on space or allowable under specified exceptions? In light of Hong Kong's special treatment granted by the United States under the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, is there evidence China has used Hong Kong-based companies to access or acquire space technology that is otherwise subject to U.S. export controls?</p>\r\n<p>4.\tAssess the status of China's international space activities. What are the contract terms and financing sources for manufacturing or launch services China has provided for other countries? What is the status and present implementation of contracts or agreements China has signed with other countries to allow China to build or maintain space infrastructure (including ground control or observation facilities), provide or manage launch services, and participate in bilateral, multilateral, and international space programs? What are China's regulatory policies concerning shared tasking and distribution of data obtained by space assets or through ground stations constructed for international clients? Describe any space-related components of China's recent military exercises with international partners. Are there any recent changes in China's willingness to share access to its satellite constellations, or access to particular capabilities of its satellite constellations, with international partners and to export more advanced space technology?</p>\r\n<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>\r\n<p>Additional Requirements:</p>\r\n<p>1.\tPrior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>\r\n<p>2.\tOnce the Commission selects a contractor for this project, and a contract is signed, public notice of this may be made on the Commission's website.</p>\r\n<p>3.\tThe Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion.
