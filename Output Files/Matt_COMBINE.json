Describe China's development of the Internet of Things. Assess the success of Chinese central and local government (including research institutes and other entities connected to or controlled by the government) efforts to develop an Internet of Things ecosystem, particularly 5G, big data, integrated platforms, and semantic technologies. Evaluate China's efforts to reach the targets (including localization targets) or desired goals for Internet of Things as laid out in its industrial plans, including the Made in China 2025, Internet Plus, and any other relevant plans. What are the remaining challenges to reaching those targets or objectives? How is China's state-directed approach impacting U.S. firms' ability to access China's market and compete against Chinese firms? How is China's emergence as a leader in the Internet of Things impacting U.S. economic and national security interests in the short, medium, and long-term?</p>\r\n<p>2. Describe the efforts of U.S. and Chinese players in setting international technical standards of Internet of Things and how these technologies and systems communicate. What is the importance of technical standards for technologies such as 5G and integrated platform technologies to the proliferation of Internet of Things? Compare and contrast U.S. and Chinese government and private sector efforts to set international standards. Assess the level of engagement between China and the United States in standards setting and design, development, and deployment. What differences, if any, are there between Chinese and U.S. technical standards for Internet of Things technologies? How will China's role in setting international standards impact U.S. businesses and U.S. competitiveness? How have Western firms and/or governments partnered with Chinese entities on developing standards and production capabilities for the Internet of Things?</p>\r\n<p>3. Assess China's access to U.S. data. What are the types and volume of data Chinese firms are collecting or are capable of collecting on U.S. citizens and firms through Internet of Things technologies? How are Chinese firms expanding their access to U.S. data? What do these data reveal? How, if at all, does the social, legal, and regulatory environment in China affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored or transmitted by Chinese firms through Internet of Things technologies? How much access does the Chinese government have to data collected by Chinese firms? What are the U.S. legal protections for data collected by Chinese firms in the United States? Assess the effectiveness of these protections for preventing misuse and ensuring data privacy.</p>\r\n<p>4. Assess the security and privacy of the Internet of Things. To what extent are the devices, how they are used, and how they transmit information susceptible to theft or exploitation? How are these vulnerabilities likely to evolve in the next 5-10 years? What are the potential vulnerabilities from U.S. usage of Chinese Internet of Things technologies, standards, and/or equipment? How, if at all, has the Chinese government leveraged Internet of Things technologies for the purposes of intelligence collection, censorship, or to launch or enable cyber attacks? What steps should the U.S. government take to mitigate the security and economic risks and improve U.S. competitiveness in Internet of Things technologies?</p>\r\n<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>\r\n<p>Additional Requirements:</p>\r\n<p>1. Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>\r\n<p>2. Once the Commission selects a contractor for this project, and a contract is signed, public notice of this may be made on the Commission's website.</p>\r\n<p>3. The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion. In ordinary circumstances, once the Commission selects a contractor and a contract is signed, a draft report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 90 days from the date the contract is signed. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract. The contractor, in their contract proposal, should stipulate the time frame for submission of the draft report. It is to be understood; however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>\r\n<p>4. As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Director shall act as the Commission's representative in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in this Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Director shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>\r\n<p>5. The report shall be free of typographical errors and conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors and deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its copyeditor for correction, the cost of which ($45.34 per hour) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>\r\n<p>6. At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>\r\n<p>7. Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>\r\n<p>8. The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>\r\n<p>9. After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's website and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>\r\n<p>10. At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall, within a year after publication of the report, agree to participate in up for two (2) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, DC area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the contractor identified as \"key personnel.\" This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Primary Selection Criteria:</p>\r\n<p>1. The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive \"best value\" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time, and past performance with the Commission, if applicable.</p>\r\n<p>2. The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above (\"key research requirements\").</p>\r\n<p>3. The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>\r\n<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>\r\n<p>1.

The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter \"the Commission\") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on the U.S. role in China's biotechnology development.</p>\r\n<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION. The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>\r\n<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in P.L. 113-291, Section 1259B), which states, \"The Commission ... shall investigate and report ... on...\"</p>\r\n<p>\"(B) The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of manufacturing, advanced technology and intellectual property, and research and development facilities, the impact of such transfers on the national security of the United States (including the dependence of the national security industrial base of the United States on imports from China), the economic security of the United States, and employment in the United States, and the adequacy of United States export control laws in relation to the People's Republic of China.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"(D) Foreign investment by the United States in the People's Republic of China and by the People's Republic of China in the United States, including an assessment of its economic and security implications....\"</p>\r\n<p>\"(H) The drivers, nature, and implications of the growing economic, technological, political, cultural, people-to-people, and security relations of the People's Republic of China's with other countries, regions, and international and regional entities (including multilateral organizations)....\"</p>\r\n<p>This report's key research requirements are:</p>\r\n<p>1. Assess the current state of China's biotechnology sector. Provide an overview of the size, nature, scope, and international competitiveness of China's biotechnology sector. Identify the major governmental policies and programs seeking to enhance the performance and capabilities of its domestic biotechnology sector. Identify the major private sector players in terms of research, commercial activities, and funding in China, and summarize their activities and funding. Compare and contrast the capabilities of China vs. the United States and other major Western countries with significant biotechnology sectors.</p>\r\n<p>2. Assess the role of foreign firms and technologies in China's biotechnology development. What are the means by which China acquires foreign technology or know-how? Identify which U.S. and other foreign biotechnologies China has already acquired or is likely to target for acquisition through legal or other means including traditional and cyber-enabled espionage. How, if at all, do these acquisitions and technology transfers align with China's biotechnology objectives as laid out in the Made in China 2025, 13th Five-Year Bioindustry Development Plan, and other biotechnology-related plans? Assess the effectiveness of tools (such as export controls) and resources available to U.S. law enforcement or other relevant agencies to protect sensitive and dual-use biotechnologies.</p>\r\n<p>3. Identify and assess Chinese investment in the U.S. biotechnology industry, including through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), joint ventures (JVs), venture capital investments, and other types of investment. What is the volume of Chinese investment in the U.S. biotechnology industry? How much financing has the Chinese government provided to support these investments? What are the investment patterns of Chinese state-owned or state-invested enterprises, state-sponsored or state-controlled research institutes, national champions, and private firms in biotechnology? What are the trends in the types of biotech capabilities and companies acquired or targeted by Chinese entities over the last five years, and what changes are anticipated in the next five years? What are the patterns in the types of investment (M&amp;As, JVs, etc.) used to acquire technologies? How, if at all, are these investments contributing to the development of China's biotechnology industry? Do acquired firms such as Syngenta still face market barriers to their products (e.g., genetically modified organisms) in China as they faced before acquisition?</p>\r\n<p>4. Assess China's access to U.S. healthcare-related data. What is the importance of healthcare-related data to future biotechnology developments? What activities and investments has China made to build the infrastructure and talent base to support the development of a national data clearinghouse and the requisite tools (e.g., machine learning tools, algorithms)? How are Chinese firms expanding their access to healthcare-related data domestically and internationally? How many, and which, Chinese firms have received U.S. accreditation to carry out genetic sequencing and other diagnostic testing for U.S. citizens? To what extent have U.S. citizens, firms, or research institutes shared healthcare-related data with Chinese firms? Is this access reciprocal for U.S. researchers and firms? What advantages does this access to data provide to Chinese and U.S. firms? What are the U.S. and Chinese legal protections for the U.S. healthcare-related data handled by Chinese firms? Assess the effectiveness of these protections for preventing misuse and ensuring privacy. Does the United States have adequate data protections and, if not, what proposals have been made to enhance security?</p>\r\n<p>5. Assess the establishment of U.S.-based research institutes by Chinese biotechnology firms. What motivates Chinese firms to establish research institutes in the United States? What is the nature of their research and development activities? How, if at all, are these institutes contributing to the development of China's biotechnology industry? What are the opportunities and risks of these research institutes to U.S. economic and national security interests?</p>\r\n<p>6. Assess China's partnerships with U.S. biotechnology firms, universities, research institutes, and non-profits. What relationships, if any, have Chinese firms, research institutes, or universities developed in the United States related to biotechnology? What are the trends in the types of biotech capabilities pursued and how, if at all, do these trends align with China's biotechnology objectives and goals? How have U.S. partners structured these relationships to address risks from China such as fabricated research and clinical data or intellectual property theft? How successful have those efforts been in addressing risks? How, if at all, have these partnerships benefited U.S. researchers or advancements in the field? How, if at all, are these partnerships contributing to the development of China's biotechnology industry? What oversight authority exists within the U.S. government to monitor, assess, and approve of these types of partnerships? What role, if any, should the U.S. government play in these partnerships to maximize the potential benefits while minimizing the potential risks?</p>\r\n<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>\r\n<p>Additional Requirements:</p>\r\n<p>1. Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>\r\n<p>2. Once the Commission selects a contractor for this project, and a contract is signed, public notice of this may be made on the Commission's website.</p>\r\n<p>3. The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion. In ordinary circumstances, once the Commission selects a contractor and a contract is signed, a draft report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 90 days from the date the contract is signed. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract. The contractor, in their contract proposal, should stipulate the time frame for submission of the draft report. It is to be understood; however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>\r\n<p>4. As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Director shall act as the Commission's representative in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in this Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Director shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>\r\n<p>5. The report shall be free of typographical errors and conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors and deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its copyeditor for correction, the cost of which ($45.34 per hour) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>\r\n<p>6. At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>\r\n<p>7. Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>\r\n<p>8. The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>\r\n<p>9. After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's website and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>\r\n<p>10. At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall, within a year after publication of the report, agree to participate in up for two (2) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, DC area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the contractor identified as \"key personnel.\" This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Primary Selection Criteria:</p>\r\n<p>1. The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive \"best value\" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time, and past performance with the Commission, if applicable.</p>\r\n<p>2. The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above (\"key research requirements\").</p>\r\n<p>3. The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>\r\n<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>\r\n<p>1. A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this RFP, to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project.</p>\r\n<p>2. Identification of the principal researchers who will be responsible for the preparation of the report.

The associated NAICS code is 541611, \"Administrative Management and General Management Consulting\".</p>\r\n<p>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 15. An agency can obtain best value in negotiated acquisitions by using any one or a combination of source selection approaches. In different types of acquisitions, the relative importance of cost or price may vary. For example, in acquisitions where the requirement is clearly definable, and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, cost or price may play a dominant role in source selection. The less definitive the requirement, the more development work required, or the greater the performance risk, the more technical or past performance considerations may play a dominant role in source selection. <br />Background Description of Requirement</p>\r\n<p>The NTSB has a need for 24/7 management and operations services of its ROC. The ROC is a state-of-the-art facility that functions primarily as the communications hub for the agency and is located within NTSB headquarters.

L. 109-435, 120 Stat. 3250-51, suspended the Postal Service's contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) until after FY 2016. In June 2017, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) revalued the FY 2016 CSRS unfunded liability at $26.9 billion and assessed the Postal Service an annual amortization payment of $1.7 billion due September 30, 2017, to liquidate the unfunded obligation by FY 2043. <br />1.2. Recent Developments on Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)<br />On November 13, 2017, the Postal Service filed a request under section 802(c) of the PAEA. The request is docketed at the Commission as PAEA Section 802(c) Request, Docket No. SS2018-1.</p>\r\n<p>In its request, the Postal Service asks the Commission to examine the actuarial appropriateness and accuracy of OPM using government-wide demographic and salary-growth assumptions rather than those specific to Postal Service CSRS employees and annuitants. The Postal Service bases its request on OPM's more recent new rules revising 5 CFR Parts 831, 839, 841, 842 and 847. OPM's new rule amending 5 CFR 831 requires prospective use of postal-specific demographic assumptions and permits use of economic assumptions including salary growth. The Postal Service maintains that using postal-specific demographic and economic assumptions (such as salary growth) is actuarially appropriate and preferable in determining its portion of the CSRS obligations. It also observes that the propriety of full use of postal-specific demographic and economic assumptions has been recognized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Postal Service's OIG and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>\r\n<p>The request does not specifically ask for a recalculation of the total CSRS liabilities, but only seeks a Commission finding upon review and comment on an actuary's report that: (1) it is appropriate and more accurate to use the postal-specific salary-growth and demographic assumptions than the assumptions used by OPM in calculating the CSRS supplemental liability and (2) that OPM should re-determine the supplemental liability using such assumptions.</p>\r\n<p>2. Objective <br />The Commission requires actuarial consultant services to review the appropriateness and accuracy <br />of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's CSRS liability. <br />3. Tasks<br />The actuarial consultant shall provide a final report, documentation, and deliverables in verbal, written and electronic format (as appropriate), and shall provide weekly written progress reports.<br />4. Disclaimer<br />Offerors are advised that the PRC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFP; all costs associated with responding to this RFP will be incurred solely at the interested party's expense. <br />The PRC reserves the right to contact any respondent to this notice for the sole purpose of enhancing PRC's understanding of the responder's proposal. The content of any responses to this RFP may be reflected in any subsequent solicitations.<br />5. Confidentiality<br />All information included in responses to this RFP is confidential and only for the use of the PRC. No information included in offeror proposals or in discussions connected to this RFP may be disclosed to any other party outside the PRC without the written consent of the offeror.<br />6. About the PRC<br />The PRC is an independent agency that is part of the executive branch of the Federal government. The PRC has exercised regulatory oversight over the Postal Service since its creation by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, with expanded responsibilities under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. The PRC is composed of five Commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a term of six years. <br />Assisting the PRC is a staff with expertise in law, economics, finance, statistics, and cost accounting. The PRC is organized into four operating offices: <br />&bull; Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC)<br />&bull; Office of the General Counsel (OGC)<br />&bull; Office of Public Affairs and Government Relations (PAGR)<br />&bull; Office of the Secretary and Administration (OSA) <br />The PRC maintains an independent office for its Inspector General. <br />OAC (39 CFR 3002.12) is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the PRC in both domestic and international matters. It provides the analytic support for PRC review of rate changes, negotiated service agreements, classifications of new products, post office closings, amendments to international postal treaties and conventions, among other issues. <br />The General Counsel (39 CFR 3002.13) directs and coordinates the functions of the OGC and is directly responsible for the counseling and advisory services set forth in 39 CFR 3000.735-102. In accordance with 3001.8 of the rules of practice, the General Counsel does not appear as an attorney in hearings in any proceeding before the PRC and takes no part in the preparation of evidence or argument presented in such hearings.<br />PAGR serves as the public face of the PRC. As such, it is the PRC's primary resource in support of public outreach and education, media relations, and relationships with Congress, the United States Postal Service, and other government agencies. PAGR provides information for consumers and responds to their inquiries; informal complaints regarding individual rate and service inquiries are referred to the Consumer Advocate of the Postal Service. Public Affairs and Government Relations staff also works closely with members of Congress and their staff.<br />OSA (39 CFR 3002.11) provides management and staff support to the PRC's operational offices (including the Office of Inspector General), the PRC's strategic plan, and various initiatives of the Executive Branch. OSA ensures that the PRC has the physical, financial, technological and human capital infrastructure needed to accomplish its mission. The effort led by OSA provides financial management, records management, administrative and organizational support, planning and human capital resources for the PRC.<br />The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was established in June, 2007, as required by an amendment to the Inspector General Act of 1978 included in the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-435 sec. 605).<br />7. Scope<br />The Commission requires actuarial consultant services to review the appropriateness and accuracy of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's CSRS liability.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>7.1.

Timeline <br />The actuarial consultant shall acknowledge that if selected to provide professional services pursuant to this SOW, all work will be conducted with the understanding that time is of the essence in meeting the contractual deadline and that no extension of the deadline will be allowed. <br />9. Deliverables Guideline<br />This section is the deliverable guideline for this project. At this time, we anticipate a work plan to include all the items listed below. However, the vendor's work/task plan to implement the scope of work is at the discretion of the vendor and should be included as part of your capabilities. Acceptance of the proposed deliverables is subject to the approval of the Commission.<br />9.1. Date due: 90 days from Contract Execution <br />Provide a final written report evaluating the determinative factors in assessing appropriate and accurate demographic and economic assumptions, and an evaluation of the current and revised prospective assumptions used and to be used by OPM in its calculation of CSRS obligations. The evaluation will include:<br />9.2.

Assistance from the Commission<br />The Commission will provide the contractor with background documents and data, as well as make staff available to answer any questions the contractor may have while completing the deliverables.<br />11. Place of Performance <br />PRC's office at 901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200W, Washington DC, 20268 and at place of business.<br />12. Quality Control<br />As a small-agency, the PRC has found that contractors can contribute significantly to the PRC and its mission success. Whenever the PRC awards a contract, it expects to receive top quality service. This section provides the crucial foundation for identifying, measuring and ensuring quality standards for consultative services.<br />The contractor will provide information, guidance, and support to the PRC for its Quality Assurance (QA) of the services provided under the contract. QA is a systematic and planned pattern of actions taken to ensure that necessary technical requirements are established, that the deliverables conform to these requirements, and that acceptable performance is achieved. Thus, the contractor will help the PRC to verify that the contractor's own Quality Control (QC) is sufficient and that their deliverables meet the agreed upon criteria. To plan and conduct QC, the contractor considers among other factors the generic criteria listed in the next paragraph.<br />A useful service for the government is delivered in a timely manner and thus the quality of performance exhibited by the contractor, will depend on their ability to deliver their services by established deadlines. The PRC expects accuracy of the services and deliverables rendered on time by the contractor. Procedures and communication between the contractor and the PRC concerning the contract shall be unmistakably clear to avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities. The procedures and deliverables of the contractor shall be consistent and in compliance with this statement of work, and shall result in services rendered that effectively meet the PRC's needs. The contractor's work shall be done in an efficient manner, and their services under the contract shall meet the highest standards (e.g., user friendly, innovative, and provide the best value to the government).<br />With the signatures of the contractor and the Contracting Officer on a finalized contract and any associated task orders, the contractor certifies that it can meet the quality standards and criteria as cited within the agreed-upon cost framework. For substandard contractor performance under the contract where delays, cost overruns as well as deviations from the agreed upon acceptable quality levels occur, the contractor will perform rework of the deliverables at no additional cost to the Government. An example of a delay that deviates from an acceptable quality level would be where timelines and contract specifications are not implemented, requiring rework of deliverables and additional cost. If the PRC is responsible for the delays or cost overruns, the PRC will incur the additional cost.<br />13.

To address these concerns, the Government will modify the Sentinel A3 with new radar antenna technologies.</p>\r\n<p>The resulting modification, the Sentinel A4 (AN/MPQ-64A4), is a three-dimensional X-band phased array radar system equipped to support beyond visual range air defense engagements. The Sentinel A4 will provide new antenna components to add detection, classification, identification, and reporting capability against Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats to support the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2-Intercept Block 2 mission while addressing current Sentinel A3 obsolescence issues and improving existing Sentinel capability against Cruise Missile (CM), Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), rotary wing, and fixed wing threats.</p>\r\n<p>As a new acquisition, the Government will use a competitive procurement for this effort. The Sentinel A4 development includes Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), and fielding to the First Unit Equipped (FUE). EMD will begin at contract award. The LRIP and FUE will be contract options. The Sentinel A4 development effort includes all engineering, program management, test and evaluation, training, and technical data needed to support a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision. The estimated period of performance (POP) for this contract requirement is 1 Jun 2019 through 30 September 2025.</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/043a5e7459ab449d7eb5f2c2fb6f5eab","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"1215","YEAR":"17","AGENCY":"Defense Logistics Agency","OFFICE":"DLA Acquisition Locations","LOCATION":"DLA Contracting Services Office - Philadelphia","ZIP":"19111-5096","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"541513","OFFADD":"700 Robbins Avenue Philadelphia PA 19111-5096","SUBJECT":"Hazardous MAterial Hazardous Waste Management System Support","SOLNBR":"SP4701-17-R-7006","RESPDATE":"122017","CONTACT":"Donald Hinkson, Contracting Officer, Phone 2157374337, Fax 215-737-7942, Email donald.hinkson@dla.mil - Robert Tomczak, Supervisory Contracting Officer, Phone 215-737-2257, Fax 215-737-7942, Email Robert.Tomczak@dla.mil","DESC":"&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 4.75pt; mso-add-space: auto; tab-stops: .5in\"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 102%\">This Request for Proposal is to provide Hazardous Manterial hazardous Waste Management System Support for the Defense Logistics Agency Information Operations J6.&nbsp; The HM/HWMS program ensures compliance with the rules and regulations for the safe handling and use of hazardous materials and hazardous waste (HM/HW), to include transporting and tracking, warehousing (stocking, storing, issuing packaging and labeling), and disposing of HM/HW.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span>HM/HW are materials that are heavily regulated through various Federal Rules and Regulations imposed by the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR); Occupation Safety Health Administration (OSHA); Department of Transportation (DOT); and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp;</span>The Hazardous Material Management System (HMMS) is the single proprietary software housing the DoD Repository of Record, as identified in DoD HAZCOM 313, for OSHA Safety Data Sheet, Global Harmonization System (GHS) of international labeling, which is a mandatory requirement for movement of Military Services property necessary to support the war fighter mission. </span></p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DLA/J3/DSCP-PB/SP4701-17-R-7006/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"US","POPADDRESS":"Hill Air Force Base\nHill AFB, UT"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"1215","YEAR":"17","AGENCY":"Department of Health and Human Services","OFFICE":"Indian Health Service","LOCATION":"Navajo Area Office","ZIP":"86515","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"541618","OFFADD":"PO Box 9020 Window Rock AZ 86515","SUBJECT":"Healthcare Facilitation and Consultation Services","SOLNBR":"18-245-SOL-00002","RESPDATE":"122617","CONTACT":"margaret shirley, Contract Specialist, Phone 928-871-5899, Email margaret.shirley@ihs.gov","DESC":"This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

NCGC has multiple ongoing and newly started projects to develop small molecules to interrupt PPI, however the projects lack a reliable cell-based assay. Fluoppi is a powerful cell-based method applicable for many uses- from hit identification to lead optimization phases in the drug discovery process.</p>\r\n<p>7. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Background Information and Objective</span>: <br />The mission of the NCGC is to bridge the gap between basic researchers studying the pathology of various diseases and the realm of high-throughput screening, allowing for the discovery and development of novel small molecule probes with activity against these same disease states. As part of this mission, our institute performs biochemical and biophysical assays on protein-protein-interactions (PPIs) involved in various diseases.

The current Sentinel radar fills a unique position in the air and missile defense architecture not met by any other existing sensor. The Sentinel A3 is approaching obsolescence end-of-life on several components, and the current configuration cannot meet all performance requirements against projected future threats. To address these concerns, the Government will modify the Sentinel A3 with new radar antenna technologies.</p>\r\n<p>The resulting modification, the Sentinel A4 (AN/MPQ-64A4), is a three-dimensional X-band phased array radar system equipped to support beyond visual range air defense engagements. The Sentinel A4 will provide new antenna components to add detection, classification, identification, and reporting capability against Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats to support the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2-Intercept Block 2 mission while addressing current Sentinel A3 obsolescence issues and improving existing Sentinel capability against Cruise Missile (CM), Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), rotary wing, and fixed wing threats.</p>\r\n<p>As a new acquisition, the Government will use a competitive procurement for this effort. The Sentinel A4 development includes Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), and fielding to the First Unit Equipped (FUE). EMD will begin at contract award. The LRIP and FUE will be contract options. The Sentinel A4 development effort includes all engineering, program management, test and evaluation, training, and technical data needed to support a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision.

The Program provides funding that builds these capacities at the regional level and empowers communities to provide proof-of-concept and commercialization assistance to innovators and entrepreneurs and operational support for organizations that provide essential early-stage funding to startups, ultimately aiming to support growing, resilient, and vibrant economies throughout the United States.<br />Since 2014, OIE has awarded nearly $57 million in Federal funding that has leveraged more than $66 million in local matching funds across 140 grants in 40 States and Puerto Rico. This funding has supported a variety of projects, including projects that provide business and technical assistance, mentoring and support networks, and increased access to early-stage capital.<br />2.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>\r\n<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>\r\n<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>\r\n<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DHS/USCG/USCGARSC/70Z03818RB2000002/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0213","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Federal Reserve","OFFICE":"Board of Governors","LOCATION":"Procurement (DFM)","ZIP":"20551","OFFADD":"20th Street and Constitution Ave, NW Washington DC 20551","SUBJECT":"","SOLNBR":"PR128587","CONTACT":"Natasha N Young, Phone 2026579204, Email natasha.n.young@frb.gov","DESC":"","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/5e1a59c975bfe60d7792b86ac0c4efb9","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0213","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Health and Human Services","OFFICE":"Food and Drug Administration","LOCATION":"Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services - Rockville","ZIP":"20857-0001","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"5417","OFFADD":"5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2129 Rockville MD 20857-0001","SUBJECT":"Broad Agency Announcement","SOLNBR":"FDABAA-18-00123","CONTACT":"Robert Maydwell, Phone 301-348-1814, Email Robert.Maydwell@fda.hhs.gov - Matthew Bucher, Contracting Officer, Phone 240-402-7570, Email Matthew.Bucher@fda.hhs.gov","DESC":"Food and Drug Administration (FDA) solicitation for research and<br />development to support regulatory science and innovation.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. \r\n\r\n(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.\r\n\r\n(End of Clause)<BR><BR>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/66fb3166ae0d29f0d6a8b0005142c71d","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"-","POPZIP":"-","POPADDRESS":"See Statement of Work."}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0214","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Health and Human Services","OFFICE":"Food and Drug Administration","LOCATION":"Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services - Rockville","ZIP":"20857-0001","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"5417","OFFADD":"5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2129 Rockville MD 20857-0001","SUBJECT":"Broad Agency Announcement","SOLNBR":"FDABAA-18-00123N","CONTACT":"Robert Maydwell, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-348-1814, Email Robert.Maydwell@fda.hhs.gov - Matthew Bucher, Contracting Officer, Phone 240-402-7570, Email Matthew.Bucher@fda.hhs.gov","DESC":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Food and Drug Administration (FDA) solicitation for research and development to support regulatory science and innovation.

Introduction and Purpose of the Request for Proposal (RFP)<br />1.1. Background on Retiree Health Benefit Fund (RHBF) <br />The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC or Commission) is an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government with regulatory oversight over the United States Postal Service (USPS or Postal Service). It is composed of five Commissioners supported by staff from its four operating offices, one of which is the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC). OAC is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the Commission in both domestic and international matters.</p>\r\n<p>The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), Pub. L. 109-435, 120 Stat. 3250-51, established the Retiree Health Benefit Fund (RHBF) to fund the long-term retiree health benefits for postal employees, retirees, and their survivors. Beginning in FY 2007 through FY 2016, the PAEA required the Postal Service to make specified annual payments into the RHBF. In FY 2017, the funding of the RHBF was changed by law to amortization of the unfunded obligation. The OPM revalued the FY 2016 RHBF unfunded liability at $56.9 billion and assessed an annual amortization payment of $955 million to liquidate the unfunded obligation by FY 2056 and a participant normal cost payment of $3.3 billion, both due September 30.<br />1.2. Recent Developments on Retiree Health Benefit Fund (RHBF) <br />On January 30, 2018, the Postal Service filed a request under 5 U.S.C. &sect; 8909a(d)(5)(A). The request is docketed at the Commission as Docket No. SS2018-2.</p>\r\n<p>In its request, the Postal Service asks the Commission to examine the actuarial appropriateness and accuracy of OPM using government-wide assumptions rather than those specific to Postal Service employees and annuitants. It also observes that the propriety of full use of postal-specific assumptions has been recognized by the Postal Service's OIG.</p>\r\n<p>The request seeks a Commission finding upon review and comment on an actuary's report that: (1) it is appropriate and more accurate to use the postal-specific assumptions than the assumptions used by OPM in calculating the RHB liability and (2) that OPM should re-determine the unfunded liability using such assumptions.</p>\r\n<p>2. Objective <br />The Commission requires actuarial consultant services to review the appropriateness and accuracy of <br />the current assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's RHB liability. <br />3. Tasks<br />The actuarial consultant shall provide a report, documentation and deliverables in verbal, written or electronic format (as appropriate) and shall provide weekly written progress reports.<br />4. Disclaimer<br />Offerors are advised that the PRC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFP; all costs associated with responding to this RFP will be incurred solely at the interested party's expense. <br />The PRC reserves the right to contact any respondent to this notice for the sole purpose of enhancing PRC's understanding of the responder's proposal. The content of any responses to this RFP may be reflected in any subsequent solicitations.<br />5. Confidentiality<br />All information included in responses to this RFP is confidential and only for the use of the PRC. No information included in offeror proposals or in discussions connected to this RFP may be disclosed to any other party outside the PRC without the written consent of the offeror.<br />6. About the PRC<br />The PRC is an independent agency that is part of the executive branch of the Federal government. The PRC has exercised regulatory oversight over the Postal Service since its creation by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, with expanded responsibilities under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. The PRC is composed of five Commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a term of six years. <br />Assisting the PRC is a staff with expertise in law, economics, finance, statistics, and cost accounting. The PRC is organized into four operating offices: <br />&bull; Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC)<br />&bull; Office of the General Counsel (OGC)<br />&bull; Office of Public Affairs and Government Relations (PAGR)<br />&bull; Office of the Secretary and Administration (OSA) <br />The PRC maintains an independent office for its Inspector General. <br />OAC (39 CFR 3002.12) is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the PRC in both domestic and international matters. It provides the analytic support for PRC review of rate changes, negotiated service agreements, classifications of new products, post office closings, amendments to international postal treaties and conventions, among other issues. <br />The General Counsel (39 CFR 3002.13) directs and coordinates the functions of the OGC and is directly responsible for the counseling and advisory services set forth in 39 CFR 3000.735-102. In accordance with 3001.8 of the rules of practice, the General Counsel does not appear as an attorney in hearings in any proceeding before the PRC and takes no part in the preparation of evidence or argument presented in such hearings.<br />PAGR (39 CFR 3002.15) serves as the public face of the PRC. As such, it is the PRC's primary resource in support of public outreach and education, media relations, and relationships with Congress, the United States Postal Service, and other government agencies. PAGR provides information for consumers and responds to their inquiries; informal complaints regarding individual rate and service inquiries are referred to the Consumer Advocate of the Postal Service. Public Affairs and Government Relations staff also works closely with members of Congress and their staff.<br />OSA (39 CFR 3002.11) provides management and staff support to the PRC's operational offices (including the Office of Inspector General), the PRC's strategic plan, and various initiatives of the Executive Branch. OSA ensures that the PRC has the physical, financial, technological and human capital infrastructure needed to accomplish its mission. The effort led by OSA provides financial management, records management, administrative and organizational support, planning and human capital resources for the PRC.<br />The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was established in June, 2007, as required by an amendment to the Inspector General Act of 1978 included in the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-435 sec. 605).<br />7. Scope<br />The Commission requires actuarial consultant services to review the appropriateness and accuracy of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's Postal Service's RHB liability. <br />7.1. Project Details<br />The actuarial consultant shall:</p>\r\n<p>&#61607; Review the existing assumptions employed by OPM to separately determine their proper use in determining RHB liabilities apportioned to the Postal Service;</p>\r\n<p>&#61607; Review the appropriateness and accuracy of using government wide assumptions to separately determine RHB liabilities apportioned to the Postal Service;</p>\r\n<p>&#61607; Determine the advantages and disadvantages of using postal-specific assumptions from both the perspectives of the Postal Service and the government as a whole when determining the RHB liability;</p>\r\n<p>&#61607; As applicable, compare OPM's current assumptions to standard or typical sets of assumptions used by other semi-government, government bodies or private sector entities;</p>\r\n<p>&#61607; Meet with OPM, USPS and USPS OIG actuaries, as needed, to discuss the appropriateness and accuracy of methods and results;</p>\r\n<p>&#61607; Support PRC staff members in identifying and assessing appropriate methods in selection of assumptions; and</p>\r\n<p>&#61607; Provide related supporting data and, to the extent practicable, models or descriptions thereof to PRC staff.<br />&#61607; Support PRC staff members <br />7.2. Report Overview <br />Provide a written report evaluating the determinative factors in assessing appropriate and accurate assumptions and an evaluation of the benefits of using assumptions specific to the Postal Service in its calculation of RHB obligations. The evaluation will include:</p>\r\n<p>1. A comparison of OPM's assumptions, where appropriate, to assumptions typically used for calculating retiree health liabilities;</p>\r\n<p>2. Specific discussion of the benefits of using postal-specific assumptions from both the perspectives of the Postal Service and the government as a whole when determining the RHB liability. <br />8. RHB Liability Examination <br />The ultimate goal of this project is to have an actuarial consultant service to review the appropriateness and accuracy of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's RHB liability. <br />To achieve this goal, the PRC has outlined the requirements for the following areas: <br />8.1. American Academy of Actuaries <br />The actuarial consultant must be a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries, have extensive experience in the retirement health benefits, and must have experience analyzing pension issues in a legal and legislative context. <br />8.2. Disclosure <br />The actuarial consultant must disclose all current and previous work performed for USPS or any other federal agency. The actuarial consultant also must disclose any pending negotiations for professional engagements with USPS or other federal agencies, apart from this SOW. <br />8.3. Qualifications<br />The actuarial consultant shall provide a description of qualifications, proposed work methods, an estimate of the length of time needed to complete the project, the total cost of the project, and the basis for the calculation. <br />8.4. Timeline <br />The actuarial consultant shall acknowledge that if selected to provide professional services pursuant to this SOW, all work will be conducted with the understanding that time is of the essence in meeting the contractual deadline and that no extension of the deadline will be allowed. <br />9. Deliverables Guideline<br />This section is the deliverable guideline for this project. At this time, we anticipate a work plan to include all the items listed below. However, the vendor's work/task plan to implement the scope of work is at the discretion of the vendor and should be included as part of your capabilities. Acceptance of the proposed deliverables is subject to the approval of the Commission.<br />9.1. Date due: 90 days from Contract Execution <br />Provide a written report evaluating the determinative factors in assessing appropriate and accurate assumptions and an evaluation of the benefits of using assumptions specific to the Postal Service in its calculation of RHB obligations. The evaluation will include: <br />9.2. Final Report <br />Task 1: Produce a Final written report that includes:<br />(a) A comparison of OPM's assumptions, where appropriate, to assumptions typically used for calculating retiree health liabilities;</p>\r\n<p>(b) Specific discussion of the benefits of using postal-specific assumptions from both the perspectives of the Postal Service and the government as a whole when determining the RHB liability.<br />(c) Due date is 90 days from Contract Execution (Estimated 22 July 2018)<br />9.3. Briefing<br />Task 2: Briefing the PRC:<br />(a) Formal oral briefing (PRC Main Conference Room)<br />(b) Oral briefing must include presentation slides.<br />(c) Date TBD (Estimated 31 July 2018) <br />9.4.

Assistance from the Commission<br />The Commission will provide the contractor with background documents and data, as well as make staff available to answer any questions the contractor may have while completing the deliverables.<br />11. Place of Performance <br />PRC's office at 901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200W, Washington DC, 20268 and at place of business.<br />12. Quality Control<br />As a micro-agency, the PRC has found that contractors can contribute significantly to the PRC and its mission success. Whenever the PRC awards a contract, it expects to receive top quality service. This section provides the crucial foundation for identifying, measuring and ensuring quality standards for consultative services.<br />The contractor will provide information, guidance, and support to the PRC for its Quality Assurance (QA) of the services provided under the contract. QA is a systematic and planned pattern of actions taken to ensure that necessary technical requirements are established, that the deliverables conform to these requirements, and that acceptable performance is achieved. Thus, the contractor will help the PRC to verify that the contractor's own Quality Control (QC) is sufficient and that their deliverables meet the agreed upon criteria. To plan and conduct QC, the contractor considers among other factors the generic criteria listed in the next paragraph.<br />A useful service for the government is delivered in a timely manner and thus the quality of performance exhibited by the contractor, will depend on their ability to deliver their services by established deadlines. The PRC expects accuracy of the services and deliverables rendered on time by the contractor. Procedures and communication between the contractor and the PRC concerning the contract shall be unmistakably clear to avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities. The procedures and deliverables of the contractor shall be consistent and in compliance with this statement of work, and shall result in services rendered that effectively meet the PRC's needs. The contractor's work shall be done in an efficient manner, and their services under the contract shall meet the highest standards (e.g., user friendly, innovative, and provide the best value to the government).<br />With the signatures of the contractor and the Contracting Officer on a finalized contract and any associated task orders, the contractor certifies that it can meet the quality standards and criteria as cited within the agreed-upon cost framework. For substandard contractor performance under the contract where delays, cost overruns as well as deviations from the agreed upon acceptable quality levels occur, the contractor will perform rework of the deliverables at no additional cost to the Government. An example of a delay that deviates from an acceptable quality level would be where timelines and contract specifications are not implemented, requiring rework of deliverables and additional cost. If the PRC is responsible for the delays or cost overruns, the PRC will incur the additional cost.<br />13.

Further, if Contractor does not obtain ethics clearance within 30 days of commencing work, this contract may be terminated in accordance with paragraph (a) (2) of General Provision 16 of this contract.</p>\r\n<p>RELATIONSHIPS</p>\r\n<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) carries out duties on behalf of the Contracting Officer (CO), but reports to the INL Senior Management Officer at Post. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>\r\n<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is delegated the authority to act for the Contracting Officer in matters concerning technical clarification, inspection and, after concurrence by the Contracting Officer, acceptance of Contractor performance under the contract, including preparation of receiving reports, and the authorization of progress payments when appropriate. The COR will coordinate all work with the Contractor and review Contractor's performance at significant stages of its development.</p>\r\n<p>In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and the conditions or waive the government's requirement, price, delivery, or other terms and conditions.

Wherever possible, pages should be printed on both sides using single spaced type.</p>\r\n<p>COMPLEXITY</p>\r\n<p>The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.<br />Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>\r\n<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS</p>\r\n<p>The PSC performs broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full-range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan, which is of significant interest to the public and to Congress.</p>\r\n<p>MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS</p>\r\n<p>1.

Wherever possible, pages should be printed on both sides using single spaced type.</p>\r\n<p>COMPLEXITY<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.<br />Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>\r\n<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The PSC performs broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full-range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan, which is of significant interest to the public and to Congress.</p>\r\n<p>MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS <br />1. U.S. citizen, obtain/maintain Department of State Secret security, Medical and Ethics clearance.<br />2. Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in one of the following areas: law enforcement, criminal justice, project management, public administration, architecture, construction science, construction management, or engineering (preferably structural or civil engineering) and six (6) years' professional work experience, of which five years should be directly related to performing functions in program management and/or contractor oversight.<br />OR<br />A minimum of ten (10) years' professional work experience, of which five years should be directly related to performing functions in program management and/or contractor oversight.</p>\r\n<p>3. Able to obtain/maintain a Federal Acquisition Certification-Contracting Officer's Representative (FAC-COR) Level II Certification within 60 days of assignment.(see http://www.fai.gov for details)<br />4. Demonstrated training or experience in contract administration principles, policies, regulations and procedures. <br />5. Demonstrated knowledge of business and management principles involved in strategic planning, resource allocation, human resources modeling, leadership technique, production methods, and coordination of people and resources.<br />6. Demonstrated knowledge of principles and processes for providing customer and personal services. This includes customer needs assessment, meeting quality standards for services, and evaluation of customer satisfaction.<br />7. Demonstrated ability to engage constructively with senior government and industry officials.<br />8. Demonstrated professional experience working in an overseas environment including experience working in a conflict/post-conflict environment.</p>\r\n<p>NOTE: FAC-COR Level II certification is a minimum requirement throughout the life of the contract. The ability to obtain/maintain a Federal Acquisition Certification-Contracting Officer's Representative (FAC-COR) Level III Certification is preferred.</p>\r\n<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS IN AFGHANISTAN<br />The work requires the ability to travel to and from several remote areas. The work requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Successful completion of a State Department Class 1 unrestricted medical exam is required. Extended assignments to remote program sites may be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft may also be required.

Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. \n\nGSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   \n\nAs part of GSA's continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.\n\nFull Products and Broad Services Offerings\nOfferor must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). \n\nFair and Reasonable Pricing\nTo determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  \n\nResultant contracts will be indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule program. Current contract holders under Schedule 738X do not need to re-apply. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this agency. Contracts under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award, and lasting for five years unless canceled or terminated.

Background. The Millennium Challenge Corporation's (MCC) mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in selected developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry.<br />MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles of selectivity, country ownerships, transparency and a focus on results.<br />The mission of MCC's Human and Community Development (HCD) practice group is to enhance people's choices by expanding their capacities to lead healthy lives, be knowledgeable and productive, and be able to come together to address common problems. The HCD practice group is seeking a general education consultant to provide technical support and advice to the MCC Burkina Faso Country Team as they oversee the development of a project focused on general education quality improvement to enhancing the supply of skilled labor in Burkina Faso. These activities are to take place as part of a potential second MCC Compact with the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF). Compact development is at an early phase, with the GoBF due to submit its project proposals in Mid-June 2018.</div>\r\n<div><br />10. Country.

Description of GSI Objectives and Activities. The GoBF identified weak basic skills and low availability of technical skills in the work force in Burkina Faso as binding constraints to economic growth and poverty reduction, based on the following initial assessment:</div>\r\n<div><br />One of the primary root causes of weak basic skills is that the quality of education is low in Burkina Faso. Although some indicators of both investment and outcomes have improved dramatically over the past 10 years, rates of enrollment are still low and strikingly, indicators of education quality or achievement such as literacy, the ability to write and numeracy remain low even for those with some schooling;<br />Another root cause of weak basic skills is continued inadequate access to secondary schooling in Burkina Faso. While investments in primary schooling, perhaps spurred by the Millennium Development Goals and including the construction of schools and classrooms, have led to large gains in primary schooling in the country over the past two decades, gains in secondary enrollment have been slower to materialize. Key contributing factors to low secondary access include the distance to schools and lack of infrastructure, high school fees and an ineffective planning framework, as well as a continued emphasis on tertiary education in the budgeting process. There are also intersecting issues with student preparedness, including a steep jump in the level of curriculum from primary to secondary school in the Burkinabe system, leading to high rates of repetition and dropout;<br />An urban/rural divide in learning outcomes, with considerable disparities across income, education and training systems are also characterized by low quality of teaching and learning, inequalities and exclusion at all levels; overall, low learning achievement is attributable to inadequate and poorly qualified teachers, inappropriate curriculum, a poor learning environment and weak management at school levels. MCC/GoBF consultations with the Burkina Faso private sector and multiple surveys note a dearth of \"soft skills\"<br />and/or \"21st century skills\" (e.g. communication, critical thinking, IT, as well as French language)<br />An initial review of the institutional, economic, and socio-cultural drivers of persistent inequities with respect to women and girls' access to education, economic participation and opportunities (e.g. schooling, jobs, entrepreneurship), explains how this phenomenon impacts urban and rural populations, and also youth.. Burkina Faso's educational attainment statistics are disconcerting: as bad as the national statistics for literacy are, once disaggregated by sex, it becomes clear that girls and women experience a disproportionate lack of access to educational and training opportunities in the more remunerative fields. Failing to address this lack of access to decent/better paying jobs and professional training opportunities will only prolong girls' and women's exclusion from more lucrative employment opportunities.<br />Deliverables.</div>\r\n<div><br />The consultant's assignments shall include the following:</div>\r\n<div><br />&bull; Planning input and active participation in consultative for a with Burkinabe stakeholders on policy and institutional reform strategies for reading improvement;<br />&bull; Bi-weekly conference calls;<br />&bull; Progress reports; and<br />&bull; Ad hoc reports as required by COR/PM related to the scope.</div>\r\n<div><br />13. Tasks. Specific tasks and/or technical directives will be defined by MCC on a regular basis, with the timing of travel and due dates for deliverables to be agreed upon with MCC periodically through tasking orders as needed to implement this Statement of Work.<br />This work will include adult functional literacy sector analysis, reviewing proposed interventions submitted by the Burkina Faso Core Team, commenting on project development documents, and providing general advice to MCC on the due diligence and project design process. Later, tasks will include support to oversight of implementation.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;This may include, but is not limited to:</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>1.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.\r\n\r\n(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—\r\n\r\n      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; \r\n\r\n      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and\r\n\r\n      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. \r\n\r\n    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. \r\n\r\n   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. \r\n\r\n(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.\r\n\r\n(End of Clause)<BR><BR>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/ffbb5b19e3fd5268dadf4e2f3dba37e8","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"-","POPZIP":"-","POPADDRESS":"See Place of Performance."}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0504","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Justice","OFFICE":"Office of Justice Programs","LOCATION":"OJP/Acquisition Management Division","ZIP":"20531","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"541611","OFFADD":"810 Seventh Street NW Washington DC 20531","SUBJECT":"Expert Medical Consultants - Disability Complaint Investigations","SOLNBR":"15PCRD18R00000080","RESPDATE":"052118","CONTACT":"Debashis Nag, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 2026161705, Email debashis.nag@usdoj.gov","DESC":"The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Office for Civil Rights (OCR) ensures that recipients of federal financial assistance (recipients) from the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), and the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) comply with civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination against individuals in the recipients' delivery of services or benefits.

On January 23, 2003, the United States established the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), an innovative foreign assistance program designed to reduce poverty by promoting sustainable economic growth. MCC, a U.S. government corporation, is based on the principle that aid is most effective in countries that promote good governance, economic freedom, and investments in people. For more information on the MCC, please visit www.mcc.gov.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>MCC&rsquo;s overriding objectives are to promote economic growth and a significant reduction in poverty in our partner countries. MCC does not take it for granted that programs that stimulate growth will invariably reduce poverty. MCC looks at the likely distributive effects of projects and, to the extent that data are available to perform such an analysis, identifies the beneficiaries and estimates the impact on poverty reduction. Ultimately, MCC seeks significant and measurable increases in incomes of large numbers of poor people and significant reductions in poverty.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>MCC analyzes the likely impact on economic growth of its programs by analyzing whether they are consistent with international and country evidence on drivers of economic growth and by use of economic rate of return (ERR) analysis. The essence of such an analysis is a straightforward comparison of costs and benefits, where the costs are the MCA grants, other front-end project development costs, and associated project life cycle operating and maintenance costs, and the benefits are increases in incomes in recipient countries.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>10.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Country.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.\r\n\r\n(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—\r\n\r\n      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; \r\n\r\n      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and\r\n\r\n      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. \r\n\r\n    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. \r\n\r\n   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. \r\n\r\n(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.\r\n\r\n(End of Clause)<BR><BR>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/5335a641f66119440af3e3e947186d95","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"-","POPZIP":"-","POPADDRESS":"See Statement of Work."}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0108","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of the Navy","OFFICE":"United States Marine Corps","LOCATION":"MCB Quantico - National Capital Region (NCR)","ZIP":"22134-5045","CLASSCOD":"D","NAICS":"541511","OFFADD":"2010 Henderson Road Quantico VA 22134-5045","SUBJECT":"MSHARP","SOLNBR":"M00264-18-R-0001","RESPDATE":"020918","CONTACT":"Judith M.

Current methods also need to be improved upon. 3) Development of new and improved methods of contraception will require research focused on addressing other knowledge gaps such as identification and validation of novel contraceptive drug targets, global identification and reproductive tract specific genes and proteins, development of improved devices and delivery systems. The CRB hopes to bridge some of these knowledge gaps with the development and improvement of contraception methods through the award of this contract.\r\n<p>The primary objective of this acquisition will be to provide a state-of-the-art facility with the capabilities and capacity to carry out chemical screening and optimization with the goal of identifying potent and safe contraceptive agents.

Through targeted, national lab-led consortia, EMN leverages federal funding to facilitate industry's access to the unique scientific and technical resources at DOE's national labs in high performance computing, synthesis and characterization of new materials, and high-impact experimentation. Each EMN consortium brings together national labs, industry, and academia to focus on specific classes of materials aligned with industry's most pressing challenges related to materials for clean energy technologies. Together, the EMN consortia form a network of advanced materials R&amp;D capabilities and resources that support American manufacturing and maintaining a competitive edge in the clean energy economy. Additional details on the Energy Materials Network can be found at <span><a href=\"https://energy.gov/eere/energy-materials-network/energy-materials-network\">https://energy.gov/eere/energy-materials-network/energy-materials-network</a></span>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt\">Within the solar energy industry, there is significant opportunity in developing new materials and designs for more durable photovoltaic (PV) modules to reduce the levelized cost of electricity. In response to this opportunity, the DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) established a national laboratory-led consortium for durable module materials (DuraMAT).</p>\r\n<p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt\">The DuraMAT-or Durable Module Materials-Consortium brings together the national lab and university research infrastructure with the photovoltaic (PV) and supply-chain industries to discover, develop, de-risk, and enable the commercialization of new materials and designs for PV modules-with the intent to decrease the levelized cost of electricity toward the SunShot 2030 goals (<span><a href=\"https://energy.gov/eere/solar/sunshot-2030\">https://energy.gov/eere/solar/sunshot-2030</a></span>).</p>\r\n<p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt\">DuraMAT aims to accelerate the rate at which companies can implement new materials and designs in PV modules by coupling an Energy Materials Network organizational architecture with PV durability science and state-of-the-art analysis. This means the interaction of rapid discovery, characterization, and testing; theory, modeling, and simulation; and data management and mining, with rapid durability testing, degradation mechanism identification, and lifetime prediction.</p>\r\n<p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in\">DuraMAT's research strategy integrates the following capability areas in an&nbsp;&nbsp; innovation engine that accelerates material development, ensures industry engagement, and meets the long- and short-term module materials research needs of the PV industry.

Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. \n\nGSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   \n\nAs part of GSA's continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.\n\nFull Products and Broad Services Offerings\nOfferor must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). \n\nFair and Reasonable Pricing\nTo determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  \n\nResultant contracts will be indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule program.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina <br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>\r\n<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT <br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of justice sector capacity-building programs for the U.S. Department of State. INL programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) focus on reforming the criminal justice system in accordance with Euro-Atlantic standards through a sustained, multi-year effort. INL has assisted the Government of BiH to reduce the backlog of war crimes cases; provide victim witness support; develop a track record of convictions against organized and transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism; enhance global and regional security; and improve law enforcement capacity to protect and serve the public. INL will continue to provide such assistance and will also target opportunities to strengthen the capacity of civil society in counter-corruption practices and improve public trust in the criminal justice system.</p>\r\n<p>The Senior Justice Advisor (SJA) will lead rule of law programmatic efforts with the BiH State Prosecutor's Office (SPO). The selected SJA will develop and implement programs to strengthen prosecutorial and judicial institutions throughout BiH (including the SPO, and entity, cantonal, and municipal prosecutorial and judicial institutions) in new, innovative, and sustainable ways. The SJA will work with - yet independently of - the Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) from the Office of the Overseas Prosecutorial Development Assistance and Training (OPDAT). Under Chief of Mission authority and INL Sarajevo supervision, the SJA will coordinate with INL's Office of Europe and Asia programs (INL/EA) to ensure efficient program management, to report host country developments impacting assistance programs, and to stay abreast of significant developments outside of BiH and the region that directly and indirectly affect U.S. government criminal justice and rule of law programs.</p>\r\n<p>The SJA will track and analyze the impact of INL-provided assistance and will coordinate with other key stakeholders, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union (EU) mission to BiH, the United Nations mission to BiH, and other governmental and non-governmental donors as appropriate to prevent duplication and increase efficiencies.</p>\r\n<p>Duties/ Responsibilities<br />1. Maintain programmatic lead on all INL rule of law advising, training, and mentoring efforts at the SPO in coordination with the OPDAT RLA, other relevant Embassy sections, and international partners, as appropriate.<br />2. Identify organizational and other impediments to effective prosecutions within the SPO and other prosecutorial and judicial offices, and work with relevant offices, other donors, and the INL Director and INL/EA to resolve.<br />3. In coordination with USAID and other relevant Embassy sections and international partners, draft and implement a plan to reform the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) to help it become more effective and less politicized. <br />4. Identify existing administrative procedures and other regulations that can be used to more effectively combat corruption, organized crime, and other financial crimes, including asset seizure and forfeiture. <br />5. Provide advisory assistance to the SPO and other prosecutorial and judicial offices in BiH to facilitate and encourage effective prosecutions for violations of Constitutional Orders and other State-level crimes.<br />6. Identify systemic gaps preventing the equitable administration of justice at the State, Entity, Cantonal, and Municipal levels in BiH, and recommend trainings and other programs to address. <br />7. Provide ad-hoc legislative technical assistance as required. <br />8. Provide regulatory technical assistance, particularly in updating relevant books of rules and other key guidelines.<br />9. Assess SPO's media strategy, identify weaknesses, and assist in creating a modern public relations and outreach strategy to better explain the role of the SPO and the importance of the rule of law. <br />10. Mentor select prosecutorial and judicial officials, to include case-based mentoring, as appropriate. <br />11. Recommend programs to encourage increased cooperation with other states in the region, to include joint trainings and personnel and information exchanges, on issues of common concern. <br />12. Provide other related advisory and training assistance as the position may require from time to time. <br />13. If required, serve as Agreements Office Representative, Contracts Office Representative and/or Grants Office Representative for INL implementing instruments, and complete the training required for such roles.</p>\r\n<p>TRAINING &amp; DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES<br />1. Complete the Contracting Officer Representative (PA296) distance-learning (DL) course through the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) within 120 days of arriving at post. <br />2. Complete the Introduction to Working in an Embassy (PN113) distance-learning (DL) course through the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) within the first six (6) months of arriving at post.<br />3. If applicable - Complete the mandatory Foreign Affairs Counter-Threat (FACT) Course (OT610) prior to deployment to post.</p>\r\n<p>DELIVERABLES/REPORTS<br />1. The SJA will consult regularly with the INL Director and other U.S. officials and provide written and oral reports on a regular basis for inclusion in the INL Director's monthly update cable to Washington. <br />2. The SJA will participate in Post's Law Enforcement Council and other relevant meetings, and will evaluate the effectiveness of programmatic activities on a quarterly basis and make recommendations to the INL Director on any recommended changes. <br />3. The SJA will provide an annual report to the INL Director and INL/EA by September 30, to include a summary of key activities; discussion on coordination with other donors and positive examples of leveraging other donors' strengths; examples of significant challenges, achievements, and shortfalls; and recommendations for future work. <br />4. The SJA will submit a final end of tour report encompassing the same information as the annual report and including an overall tour summary.</p>\r\n<p>RELATIONSHIP<br />The SJA is supervised by the INL Director at Embassy Sarajevo. As a subject-matter expert, the SJA will provide advice and implement programs on behalf of the INL Director and INL/EA. The SJA will also maintain open, timely, and effective communications with various Department bureaus and offices as required to build relationships that address problems with flexible, workable solutions.</p>\r\n<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is delegated the authority to act for the Contracting Officer in matters concerning technical clarification, inspection and, after concurrence by the Contracting Officer, acceptance of Contractor performance under the contract, including preparation of receiving reports, and the authorization of progress payments when appropriate. The COR will coordinate all work with the Contractor and review Contractor's performance at significant stages of its development.</p>\r\n<p>In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and the conditions or waive the government's requirement, price, delivery, or other terms and conditions. Such changes must be authorized, in writing, to the Contracting Officer.</p>\r\n<p>COMPLEXITY<br />INL programs are highly complex, multi-year, and focused on capacity-building. Developing and implementing these programs requires excellent judgement, the ability to resolve critical problems, and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. Close coordination within the embassy and strong interpersonal skills are essential. Programs are often characterized by large obligations of U.S. government funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-term implementation and administration of the programs. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>\r\n<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The SJA will perform broad and extensive assignments with high visibility in a complex, dynamic political environment directly affecting the rule of law in BiH. All activities must be closely coordinated with the embassy country team through the INL Director. Programming activity could eventually span multiple layers of the state and within governmental institutions and include a wide range of justice sector capacity-building activities.</p>\r\n<p>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS<br />1. U.S. Citizen capable of attaining and maintaining a Secret security and medical clearance.<br />2. A Juris Doctorate from an accredited US university. <br />3. Demonstrated five years' experience as a prosecutor or defense attorney. <br />4. Demonstrated three years' experience, at least one year of which specially relates to BiH, working in the prosecution of international war crimes, organized crime, and/or financial crimes. <br />5. Demonstrated record of successful state-level prosecutor capacity-building assistance in one or more countries of the former Yugoslavia. <br />6. Demonstrable legal experience with asset forfeiture and other administrative tools to disincentivize illicit activities and remunerate victims of crime. <br />7. Demonstrated record of working in a complex and highly charged political environment. <br />8. Significant experience working and coordinating with relevant U.S. agencies and embassies, foreign governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations. <br />9. Superior interpersonal skills.<br />10. Excellent oral and written English communication skills.</p>\r\n<p>GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT<br />The SJA will be embedded in the BiH SPO. Additionally, Embassy Sarajevo will provide desk space, a computer, office telephone, and other supplies as necessary at the embassy. This property will be owned and maintained by the Department of State.</p>\r\n<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>\r\n<p>FACTOR 1 (40 points)<br />Ability to manage rule of law advising, training, and mentoring programs with the State Prosecutor's Office in coordination with the OPDAT RLA, other relevant Embassy sections, and international partners, as appropriate. This includes identifying organizational and other impediments to effective prosecutions within the SPO, as well as other prosecutorial and judicial offices as required.</p>\r\n<p>FACTOR 2 (20 points)<br />Ability to identify and implement programs facilitating BiH's use of administration tools, including asset seizure and forfeiture, to disincentivize corrupt activities and remunerate victims of crime in line with international best practices and other recognized norms.</p>\r\n<p>FACTOR 3 (20 points)<br />Ability to navigate a complex, dynamic, and highly-charged political environment while pressing for progress on sensitive issues. This includes ensuring that all activities have sufficient host-nation buy-in to be successful and support U.S. goals for BiH.</p>\r\n<p>FACTOR 4 (20 points)</p>\r\n<p>Ability to liaise effectively with U.S. Embassy Sarajevo, the INL/EA Program Officer, other U.S. agencies, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations. Additionally, the ability to convey programmatic progress clearly and succinctly via regular official and unofficial reporting.</p>\r\n<p>The most qualified candidates may be interviewed, required to provide a writing sample, and demonstrate an ability to operate commonly used office applications. INL will not pay for any expenses associated with the interviews. In addition, applications (written materials and interviews) will be evaluated based on content as well as on the applicant's writing, presentation, and communication skills. In the event that a candidate has fully demonstrated his/her qualifications and there are no other competitive applicants, INL reserves the right to forego the interview process. Professional references and academic credentials will be evaluated for applicants being considered for selection.</p>\r\n<p>COMPENSATION (BASE PAY)<br />For award, INL will negotiate for this contract based on the market value as outlined above and overall experience relevant to the solicitation requirements.</p>\r\n<p>BENEFITS &amp; ALLOWANCES<br />AS A MATTER OF POLICY, INL NORMALLY AUTHORIZES THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES</p>\r\n<p>BENEFITS - IF APPLICABLE<br />&bull; Employee's FICA/Medicare Contribution<br />&bull; Contribution toward Health and Life Insurance <br />&bull; Pay Comparability Adjustment <br />&bull; Annual Increase <br />&bull; Eligibility for Worker's Compensation <br />&bull; Annual, Sick and Home Leave <br />&bull; 401K Plan <br />&bull; MEDVAC (provided by DOS Med)</p>\r\n<p>ALLOWANCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH DEPARTMENT OF STATE STANDARDIZED REGULATIONS (DSSR) - IF APPLICABLE <br />&bull; Temporary Quarters Subsistence Allowance (TQSA) or Per Diem upon arrival at Post<br />&bull; Housing Allowance<br />&bull; Post Allowance<br />&bull; Supplemental Post Allowance <br />&bull; Maintenance Allowance (SMA)<br />&bull; Education Allowance<br />&bull; Educational Travel (full-time United States based secondary) <br />&bull; Post Hardship Differential<br />&bull; Danger Pay<br />&bull; Shipment of HHE, UAB, POV and Consumables</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/State/INL/INL-RM-MS/PSC-18-033-INL/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"BA","POPADDRESS":"US Embassy"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0618","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Library of Congress","OFFICE":"Contracts Services","LOCATION":"Contracts Services","ZIP":"Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business","CLASSCOD":"D","NAICS":"541513","OFFADD":"Library of Congress, Contracts Services, Contracts Services, 101 Independence Ave SE, Washington, DC, 20540-9411","SUBJECT":"P1TO Vistalink License Renewal & Support","SOLNBR":"030ADV18Q0345","RESPDATE":"062518","CONTACT":"James C.

Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. \n\nGSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   \n\nAs part of GSA's continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.\n\nFull Products and Broad Services Offerings\nOfferor must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). \n\nFair and Reasonable Pricing\nTo determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  \n\nResultant contracts will be indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule program.

As the first step, a team consisting of economists, private sector specialists, and social and gender specialists from the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and MCC completed a constraints to growth diagnostic study (CA), which identified the following two binding constraints to growth in Sri Lanka: (i) transport - particularly bottlenecks resulting in traffic congestion in the Western Province and the slow movement of people, goods and services between the Western Province and other regions and (ii) access to land, mainly the difficulty of the private sector in accessing land for commercial purposes. MCC team is working with the Sri Lanka Core Team, established in the Office of Policy Development (OPD) in the Prime Minister's Office for preparing the Compact.  On May 9, 2017 the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL), through its Compact Development Team (CDT), submitted two concepts notes for MCC's consideration to address the core problems and root causes underlying the transport and land binding constraints.</p>\r\n<p>10.\tDescription of Services:</p>\r\n<p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) wants to recruit an individual Land Survey and Mapping Advisor. MCC is seeking for the advisor  to provide the MCC Country Team with expertise and technical knowledge based on international best practices on cadastral land surveying, mapping technology, and capacity building issues as the MCC Country Team conducts due diligence of a Government of Sri Lanka proposal for a land project under a possible MCC Compact.  MCC seeks candidates that have knowledge of and experience working in Sri Lanka's land sector on issues related to improving land governance, land management, and land administration frameworks.  <br />11.\tTasks</p>\r\n<p>1.\tTo provide advice and technical support to MCC on land mapping, cadastral survey, land registration, and other related issues as they arise in discussions with the GOSL on MCC land project design and activities.</p>\r\n<p>The Consultant will use his/her knowledge of Sri Lanka and international best practices to review and provide an assessment of GOSL land project proposals (either written proposals or oral proposals obtained during meetings) on whether proposed activities are:  1) fit for purpose; 2) comply with international best practices; 3) cost effective in achieving the expected outcomes; and 4) can be completed in the time available for the project under a 5-year Compact with MCC.  The assessment should identify key factors and risks to the success of the land project and provide advice on approaches and strategies that MCC can employ to improve the likelihood of success. This should include the identification of leverage points that MCC may use to promote legislative and process reforms as needed to implement the project.  The Consultant will also assist MCC to identify the interests and motivations of key stakeholders in supporting necessary reforms.</p>\r\n<p>2.\tTo support MCC in assessing the technology best suited to the timely and efficient completion of proposed project activities related to mapping, surveying and land titling activities.</p>\r\n<p>The Consultant will evaluate the use of technology for the land mapping, surveying and titling activities to determine the best suited technology to maximize the collection of required information, efficiency in gathering data, and the cost-effectiveness of project activities.  The Consultant's recommendations should be supported by research that considers use of other technology and provides justification for the recommended technology.  The Consultant should also provide MCC with technical specifications and cost estimates for equipment, software and any other technology that can be used in the future for procurement purposes.</p>\r\n<p>3.\tThe consultant will assist MCC in the design and development of a capacity building program for government cadastral personnel and private land surveyors, including the development and implementation of a system of quality control and assurance for cadastral surveys.</p>\r\n<p>The Consultant will support the MCC Country Team with assessment of existing capacity to implement the MCC land project activities and conceptualize interventions that will build GOSL and private sector capacity to implement the project and ensure that project outputs are completed at an acceptable level of quality and accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>4.\tProvide support for MCC final analysis and decision on whether to invest in the land sector in Sri Lanka based on the GOSL proposal for a land project under the MCC Compact.</p>\r\n<p>The consultant will support MCC country team to prepare its final recommendations to the IMC on a land investment in Sri Lanka.  This will require detailed analysis of the final project proposal and budget, review and advice on MCC's recommendations for improvement of the proposal, and development of policy reform conditions that should become part of the Compact agreement with the GoSL.  The consultant will provide additional advice, analysis and review as needed to support the development of country team recommendations to the IMC.</p>\r\n<p>The Consultant's work product for all tasks will be provided in written documentation and recommendations that can be incorporated into the MCC due diligence findings and presented to the Government of Sri Lanka.  The Consultant's written findings and recommendations will be presented in a format agreed upon with the MCC Country Team and which the Country Team can easily incorporate into its own reports and recommendations back to the Government of Sri Lanka for revision and improvement of the project proposal.</p>\r\n<p>12.\tCoordination and Reporting: The selected candidate will be required to support other practice groups in the Department, including but not limited the MCC Country Team.</p>\r\n<p>13.\tTiming and Reporting: <br />All formal communication with MCC, including reports, will be submitted to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COR), Program Manager (PM), and other designated MCC personnel.

The COR/PM will review and evaluate the contractor's performance, and also will coordinate any communications with relevant counterparts and other donor agencies and organizations.</p>\r\n<p>Any changes in the terms of the ToR will be made in writing and approved by the Contracting Officer. No representation of the COR/PM shall serve as a basis for an alteration in the general scope of this ToR or of the terms and conditions of the ToR unless confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

Proceeding with the work without proper contractual coverage could result in nonpayment for that work.</p>\r\n<p><br />14.\tPeriod and Place of Performance: The intermittent contractor will be required to work for one year from the date of award through an addition two year period of performance. Each year will result with up to 520 hours per year.

The GoBF identified weak basic skills and low availability of technical skills in the work force in Burkina Faso as binding constraints to economic growth and poverty reduction, based on the following initial assessment:</p>\r\n<p>One of the primary root causes of weak basic skills is that the quality of education is low in Burkina Faso. Although some indicators of both investment and outcomes have improved dramatically over the past 10 years, rates of enrollment are still low and strikingly, indicators of education quality or achievement such as literacy, the ability to write and numeracy remain low even for those with some schooling;</p>\r\n<p>Another root cause of weak basic skills is continued inadequate access to secondary schooling in Burkina Faso. While investments in primary schooling, perhaps spurred by the Millennium Development Goals and including the construction of schools and classrooms, have led to large gains in primary schooling in the country over the past two decades, gains in secondary enrollment have been slower to materialize. Key contributing factors to low secondary access include the distance to schools and lack of infrastructure, high school fees and an ineffective planning framework, as well as a continued emphasis on tertiary education in the budgeting process. There are also intersecting issues with student preparedness, including a steep jump in the level of curriculum from primary to secondary school in the Burkinabe system, leading to high rates of repetition and dropout;<br /> <br />An urban/rural divide in learning outcomes, with considerable disparities across income, education and training systems are also characterized by low quality of teaching and learning, inequalities and exclusion at all levels; overall, low learning achievement is attributable to inadequate and poorly qualified teachers, inappropriate curriculum, a poor learning environment and weak management at school levels. MCC/GoBF consultations with the Burkina Faso private sector and multiple surveys note a dearth of \"soft skills\" and/or \"21st century skills\" (e.g. communication, critical thinking, IT, as well as French language)</p>\r\n<p>An initial review of the institutional, economic, and socio-cultural drivers of persistent inequities with respect to women and girls' access to education, economic participation and opportunities (e.g. schooling, jobs, entrepreneurship), explains how this phenomenon impacts urban and rural populations, and also youth.. Burkina Faso's educational attainment statistics are disconcerting: as bad as the national statistics for literacy are, once disaggregated by sex, it becomes clear that girls and women experience a disproportionate lack of access to educational and training opportunities in the more remunerative fields. Failing to address this lack of access to decent/better paying jobs and professional training opportunities will only prolong girls' and women's exclusion from more lucrative employment opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Deliverables. <br />The consultant's assignments shall include the following:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;\tPlanning input and active participation in consultative for a with Burkinabe stakeholders on policy and institutional reform strategies for reading improvement;<br />&bull;\tBi-weekly conference calls; <br />&bull;\tProgress reports; and<br />&bull;\tAd hoc reports as required by COR/PM related to the scope.</p>\r\n<p>13.\tTasks. Specific tasks and/or technical directives will be defined by MCC on a regular basis, with the timing of travel and due dates for deliverables to be agreed upon with MCC periodically through tasking orders as needed to implement this Statement of Work.</p>\r\n<p>This work will include adult functional literacy sector analysis, reviewing proposed interventions submitted by the Burkina Faso Core Team, commenting on project development documents, and providing general advice to MCC on the due diligence and project design process. Later, tasks will include support to oversight of implementation.

The Kingman springsnail is a BLM sensitive species and aligns with the Department of Interior's (DOI) first priority of \"Creating a conservation legacy second only to Teddy Roosevelt\" by working to develop and implement priority habitat monitoring and improvement projects. This project is in line with the guidance provided by BLM Manual 6840 - Special Status Species Management as it provides information about the habitat requirements and locations of the species to assist with management. This project furthers the objective detailed in 6840.02, which directs the BLM \"B. To initiate proactive conservation measures that reduce or eliminate threats to Bureau sensitive species to minimize the likelihood of and need for listing of these species under the ESA.\" The authority lies under 6840.03 C. with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), as amended (FLPMA). The manual states in 6840.04 that \"A. The Director is responsible for overseeing implementation of Special Status species policies on BLM-administered lands, coordinating as needed with State Directors on select, multi-State species conservation issues, and making any applications for project exemptions under Section 7(g) of the ESA to the Secretary of the Interior.\" This project further implements 6840.04, which gives the State Director the responsibility for \"2. Coordinating the BLM special status species conservation efforts with adjoining BLM State Offices, State and other Federal agencies, various private organizations, and BLM stakeholders.\" Additionally to the DOI's first priority, having the data derived from this environmental research on hand will \"streamline the environmental and regulatory review process\" thereby enabling BLM to expedite processing requests for grazing use, mineral material extraction, etc. Streamlining and expediting the process is envisioned in Priorities 2 and 5c by \"Utilizing our natural resources\" and \"Considering the impact of decisions on economic development and job creation.\"\n\nBackground:\n The Kingman springsnail (Pyrgulopsis conica; springsnail) is an endemic aquatic mollusk located in the Black Mountains in Mohave County, Arizona. The Kingman springsnail is listed as a BLM sensitive species and in cooperation with other agencies is being monitored to develop and implement a statewide conservation agreement. WildEarth Guardians petitioned the Kingman springsnail in June 2007 for ESA listing under their 475-species petition, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) made a positive 90-day finding on the species in December 2009.  The USFWS and Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies have identified the Kingman springsnail as one of 12 Arizona mollusks to be evaluated in the 2017 USFWS National Work Plan for ESA listing evaluations over the next seven years.  The purpose of this project is to survey potential spring sites within BLM managed lands within the Black Mountains for the presence of springsnails and genetically identify any located snails to species. This information would be used in the development of a Springsnail Multi-species Conservation Plan, which may include public lands managed by the BLM.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOI/BLM/AZ/140L6418Q0023/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"USA","POPZIP":"86401","POPADDRESS":"BLM Kingman Field Office<br />Kingman<br />AZ<br />86401<br />USA<br />"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0703","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Commerce","OFFICE":"Office of the Secretary","LOCATION":"Shared Services Organization - Office of the Secretary","ZIP":"20230","CLASSCOD":"B","NAICS":"541690","OFFADD":"14th & Constitution Avenue NW\r\nRoom Suite A-200 Washington DC 20230","SUBJECT":"Statistical Reference Database","SOLNBR":"BABC1321-18-00031","RESPDATE":"071118","CONTACT":"Spencer W.

The Land Project of the Mozambique Compact aimed to establish more efficient and secure access to land by improving the land governance system and increasing recognition of land rights in the statutory system through provision of systematic land use certificates (DUATs), which were expected in turn to improve land markets, land investments and related land values.

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. Government corporation whose mission is to provide assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in carefully selected developing countries that demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizens. For more information on the MCC please visit www.mcc.gov.</p>\r\n<p>MCC recognizes that gender and social inequalities can be significant constraints to economic growth and poverty reduction. MCC's Gender Policy and operational guidance ensure that gender will be considered in the selection of eligible countries and integrated into the assessment, development, and design of Compacts funded by the Millennium Challenge Account, the monitoring of program results, and the evaluation of program impacts (http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/14&#8208;genderpolicy.pdf). MCC's Gender Milestones and Operational Procedures strengthen and concretize the requirements of the Gender Policy and contribute to the MCC's and the Country Core Team's ability to ensure gender integration in projects that may be funded.</p>\r\n<p>Adopted in 2015, MCC's Counter-Trafficking in Persons (C-TIP) Policy (https://www.mcc.gov/resources/doc/policy-counter-trafficking-in-persons-policy) prohibits any type of labor or sexual exploitation related to MCC-funded projects. The policy lays out operational procedures to conduct a TIP risk assessment for each project and guidance on how to determine its risk rating. The policy places strong emphasis on risk mitigation and prevention of TIP in MCC-funded projects.</p>\r\n<p>As part of the Department of Compact Operations, the Gender and Social Inclusion practice group works with country counterparts and MCC staff to identify TIP risks. All programs funded by MCC have a Social and Gender Integration Plan (SGIP), which addresses specific risks women or vulnerable groups may face and also includes measures to optimize any potential benefits the programs may bring to such groups. MCC-funded projects that are considered high-risk for labor and sexual exploitation are required to develop and implement a TIP Risk Management Plan. The GSI team collaborates with Environmental and Social Performance (ESP) team to assess social risks and approaches to mitigate such risks. The MCC has adopted the IFC Performance Standards, and ESP is responsible for implementing it throughout our programs. Regarding Trafficking in Persons specifically, the IFC Performance Standard 2 on Work and Labor conditions covers labor exploitation. Similarly, the IFC Performance Standard 4 on Community Health, Safety, and Security covers risks related to gender-based violence, although with a limited scope. Throughout all infrastructure projects, MCC includes various safeguards such as prevention of HIV/AIDs, TIP, and child labor. Therefore the approach, tools, and materials developed through this consultancy should be incorporated into already existing safeguards and processes such as the Initial Social and Gender Assessment (ISGA), Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Social and Gender Integration Plan (SGIP), etc.</p>\r\n<p>10.\tCountry. MCC eligible countries.</p>\r\n<p>11.\tScope of Work <br />The GSI team is seeking an expert, on a consultancy basis, to support the team in the assessment and mitigation strategy for sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) related to our projects. The materials developed will be consistent with other MCC guidance and policies, and with MCC's specific mandate of poverty reduction through economic growth and the sectors in which MCC regularly works.</p>\r\n<p>The Gender and Social Inclusion (GSI) Practice Group is seeking an expert consultant to support the development of guidance documents and tools to assess and address SEA risks and respond to specific incidents within our projects. The consultant will also develop training materials for contractors, country accountable entities (called Millennium Challenge Accounts, or MCAs), and MCC staff; provide technical support assessing and developing a risk mitigation plan for specific projects throughout our partner countries; and if necessary, assess and develop plans to respond to any specific SEA incidents related to our projects.</p>\r\n<p>This consultancy will be divided in two phases. Phase 1 includes a review of key documentation and consultation with MCC staff to understand MCC's current operational approach to assess and address SEA and TIP risks in MCC-funded projects. Based on this input, the consultant will prepare a concept note with specific recommendations on how to assess and mitigate SEA risks and respond to any instances of SEA in relation to MCC-funded projects. Next, the consultant will conduct consultations with MCC staff to get feedback on the concept note, and based on this feedback, the consultant will then develop the following documents: 1) guidance on assessing SEA risks related to MCC-funded projects; 2) guidance on mitigating identified risks; 3) guidance on responding to SEA situations related to MCC-funded projects; and 4) training materials for contractors, MCA, and MCC staff. This phase will also include delivering training sessions to MCC staff, and potentially MCAs. Upon completion of the tasks in Phase 1, MCC will determine whether to exercise Phase 2 of the contract (option years). This phase may include technical support to MCC and our partner countries in conducting risk assessment, developing mitigation plans, support responding to any specific instances of SEA related to the implementation of our projects, and delivering trainings in partner countries.</p>\r\n<p>In fulfilling these tasks, the expert shall work closely with GSI staff, but also consult MCC staff in other departments and sectors. The GSI team will oversee this consultancy.</p>\r\n<p><br />12.\tTasks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PHASE 1:</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.\tDesk review: The consultant will undertake a review of relevant documentation, including: MCC's Gender Policy; MCC's C-TIP Policy; MCC Compact Development Guidance; MCC's guidance on IFC Performance Standards; Guidance on and examples of Social and Gender Integration Plan (SGIP) that address TIP risks and mitigation, examples of TIP Risk Management Plans from relevant MCAs and their contractors, and examples of MCC standard bidding documents.</p>\r\n<p><br />2.\tPrepare guidance for SEA risk assessment: The consultant will prepare operational guidance with specific questions, tools, and methodologies for MCC and partner countries to assess the risks, mainly in project development phase but also retroactively in projects in implementation. The guidance for risk assessment will focus on risks related to construction projects, and it must be flexible enough to be applied to different countries and sectors. The guidance will differentiate the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders involved in this phase, such as MCC country team, MCA/Core Team/Threshold Program team, ESIA consultants, etc. Language will be simple, clear, and concise, and the guidance will include a rating criteria to determine which projects are high risk or low risk for SEA to guide staff in determining the response necessary for each project.</p>\r\n<p>3.\tPrepare guidance on SEA risk response, mitigation, and prevention: The consultant will prepare a guidance document on how to respond to, mitigate, and prevent risks previously identified and prevent SEA within each project and country context. The consultant will determine in collaboration with GSI whether it is necessary to differentiate between mandated requirements to mitigate SEA risks in all MCC-funded projects and other requirements that would apply to high-risk projects. It will also need to differentiate the roles and responsibilities in these efforts of different institutions involved, such as MCC, MCA, Threshold Program teams, contractors, supervisory engineers, etc. It will be particularly important to ensure this guidance includes proper provisions to engage and set up partnerships with local NGOs, women's organizations, or other local entities that could serve as service providers to respond to any cases of SEA in MCC funded projects, including support to SEA survivors. The guidance should include recommendations for setting up safe and confidential reporting mechanisms for community members to report SEA incidents and concerns; this should include guidance on the staff and non-staff resources required for the mechanisms. The guidance should take into consideration the TIP risk assessment questions and approach.</p>\r\n<p>4.\tPrepare Guidance on reporting and responding to SEA cases: This guidance will be similar to a response protocol, describing the process to address any cases of SEA related to the projects. This protocol will have the primary focus of providing support to the SEA survivor(s), with the contractor carrying the financial responsibilities and ensuring the previously identified institutions are adequately acting as service providers. Furthermore, this document will include:</p>\r\n<p>a.\tReporting chain, within the partner country, between the partner country and MCC, within MCC, and between MCC and other U.S. government entities.<br />b.\tProcess to trigger partnership with existing resource providers who will provide support to SEA survivors.<br />c.\tMechanism for MCC and MCA to follow up on support to SEA survivor(s).<br />d.\tRe-assessment of risk mitigation strategy in order to consider additional actions to further mitigate additional SEA risks through community awareness raising as well as further capacity building to workers.<br />e.\tRe-assessment of reporting mechanisms for other potential victims to safely and confidentially report other instances of SEA (this mechanism would be through the previously established service provider). This task will confirm that the previously established processes are adequate and useful in order to ensure that other potential victims can receive the necessary assistance.<br />f.\tRecommendations on how contractor responsibilities should be laid out in standard bidding documents.</p>\r\n<p>5.\tPrepare Training materials for contractors, MCA, and MCC staff: The consultant will develop the following set of training materials:<br />a.\tSEA risk assessment, tailored for MCC and MCA staff<br />b.\tSEA risk mitigation and prevention, tailored for MCC and MCA staff<br />c.\tResponding to instances of SEA, tailored for MCC and MCA staff<br />d.\tBasic SEA training for construction workers<br />e.\tSEA awareness raising for communities near project sites (with a focus on reporting any cases to designated service provider or entity)</p>\r\n<p>6.\tDelivery of trainings to MCC and/or MCA staff: The MCC GSI team will determine how the trainings will be delivered, including timeframe, groups, etc. The consultant will train MCC staff and depending on the situation might train select MCAs. Training materials for construction workers and communities will be delivered by the MCA GSI Director or other designated party.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PHASE 2 (option years): </strong></p>\r\n<p>1.\tTechnical support to assess risks and develop a risk mitigation plan: Depending on the need, the MCC GSI team may request the consultant to assist with the assessment and risk mitigation plan for specific projects. This work may be conducted individually, in collaboration with other staff (both at the MCC or MCA level), or with other consultants. The work will be conducted using the tools developed for these purposes.</p>\r\n<p>2.\tTechnical support responding to any instances of SEA: In the case that a SEA incident is reported, MCC GSI may request support from the consultant in responding to that situation, with a focus on providing support to the survivor(s), ensuring the proper systems are in place for other victims to safely and confidentially report incidents and receive support, as well as reviewing the mitigation measures in place to ensure the risks are being appropriately addressed.</p>\r\n<p>3.\tDelivery of training to MCA staff, contractors, or other country-based institutions: MCC GSI may request the consultant delivers training to country-based staff, including MCA, contractors, and implementing entities. For this task, the consultant would be expected to adapt the training materials previously developed for each project and country context. The consultant may also be requested to co-deliver the training with other MCA GSI staff.</p>\r\n<p>13.\tDeliverables.<br />Phase 1: <br />&bull;\tConcept note on MCC's approach to SEA (draft version and after consultations with staff, final version)<br />&bull;\tGuidance to assess SEA risks<br />&bull;\tGuidance to respond to and mitigate identified SEA risks <br />&bull;\tGuidance to respond to SEA incidents<br />&bull;\tTraining materials for MCC, MCA, and contractors</p>\r\n<p>Phase 2: <br />&bull;\tRisk assessment reports <br />&bull;\tRisk response and mitigation plans<br />&bull;\tRecommendation reports on responding to specific TIP incidents<br />&bull;\tTraining materials tailored for each project or program<br />&bull;\tTrip reports</p>\r\n<p><br />14.\tCoordination and Reporting.

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. Government corporation whose mission is to support economic growth and poverty reduction. It provides large-scale grant assistance in the form of 5-year Compacts, or agreements, that fund large-scale development projects in carefully selected countries that demonstrate a commitment to good governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC Compacts are implemented by host governments through legal entities that they establish (typically referred to as Millennium Challenge Accounts or MCAs). For more information on the MCC, please visit www.mcc.gov.</p>\r\n<p>10.\tCountry. MCC eligible countries.</p>\r\n<p>11.\tDescription of GSI Objectives and Activities. MCC recognizes that sexual harassment is a global problem that can harm the integrity and performance of both people and organizations and their potential to achieve their objectives. MCC is committed to supporting workplaces where all staff can work together with respect, accountability, and trust. In 2016, MCC published a guidance note is to provide the Millennium Challenge Accounts (\"MCAs\") in our partner countries with initial guidance on addressing sexual harassment. The guidance notes recommends that MCAs review policies and procedures currently in place, develop new policies and procedures when they are absent, and ensure that their anti-sexual harassment policies and procedures are based on the principles described in the guidance note. In 2017, MCC incorporated the anti-sexual harassment guidance into the Human Resources Manual for MCAs and began requiring that all new MCAs develop a policy on addressing Sexual Harassment. MCC also requires that its programs be implemented in accordance with the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Performance Standards (PS) on Environmental and Social Sustainability, including PS-2 on Labor and Working Conditions.</p>\r\n<p>In support of this effort, MCC seeks an individual consultant with in-depth knowledge of and experience with policy development, training, awareness raising, and capacity building to address workplace sexual harassment, particularly in the context of large-scale international development projects in developing countries. The consultant should have extensive familiarity with the application of US and international best practice regarding workplace sexual harassment and how to effectively develop and implement anti-sexual harassment trainings and other measures to ensure application of policies on the issue in diverse cultural settings. The consultant will provide technical assistance to MCC and MCAs in supporting the development of policy documents, protocols, and training materials addressing sexual harassment in order to support a safe working environment in the MCAs and among MCA contractors and consultants.</p>\r\n<p>12.\tScope and Tasks.

Responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. The Government anticipates the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to these services to be either 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services; or 541720 - Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities. (Note: the Government is open to industry recommendations on the appropriate NAICS code for this requirement.) Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>\r\n<p>The Violence Against Women Act of 2005 (Public Law Number 109-162), at Title IX, Section 904(a) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &sect; 3796gg-10 note) mandates that the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), in consultation with the United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), conduct a National Baseline Study (NBS) on violence against American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) women living in tribal communities. Because of the broad scope of the work outlined in the legislation and the complexity of the topic, NIJ refers to this directive as a program of research, rather than a single baseline study, because multiple research projects over a period of time are required and being commissioned to address the entire statutory mandate. The purpose of the research program is to: examine violence against AI and AN women (including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking sex trafficking, and murder) and identify factors that place AI and AN women at risk for victimization; evaluate the effectiveness of federal, state, tribal, and local responses to violence against AI and AN women; and propose recommendations to improve effectiveness of these responses.</p>\r\n<p>To this end, the Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) is issuing this notice to identify qualified and responsible vendors, to obtain information in developing an acquisition to support NIJ's research program. Specifically, the Government seeks Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) Concerns under NAICS 541611or Women-owned Small Business (WOSB) Concerns under 541720 that will assist with implementing and managing tribal research sites under the direction of NIJ, by implementing a study of public health, wellness, and safety among AI and AN women; also referred to NIJ's National Baseline Study (NBS) on Public Heath, Wellness, and Safety.</p>\r\n<p>The following subject areas describe the general areas of interest or concern to support this effort:</p>\r\n<p>1. Site Outreach, Selection, and Recruitment: Assisting with the selection of NBS tribal research sites and determining tribal support and willingness to participate in the NBS and identifying additional or replacement sites, if needed.<br />2. Study Protocol Development, Review, and Adjustment: Assisting with the refinement of the NBS questionnaire, to include drafting and maintaining all NBS documents (e.g., study manual, training materials, study protocols, individual sampling plans, marketing/outreach plan, USDOJ Confidentiality and Human Subjects Protection paperwork).<br />3. Data Collection: Providing, and coordinating with, local data collection services and data collection teams (e.g., site coordinators, field interviewers, interpreters), and organizing local data collection support activities (e.g., transportation, child care, behavioral health services).<br />4. Data Monitoring: Developing and maintaining a NBS site data collection schedule and monitoring NBS site data collections efforts, including supervising transmission of data to the NBS Data Center.<br />5. General Operations: Promoting efficient and effective site operations.<br />6. Data Analysis: Assisting with data analysis, interpretation, and presentation of NBS findings.</p>\r\n<p>Objectives of this requirement must be met by skilled, experienced, professional, and/or technical personnel.

Both areas will be supported in the base contract as well as in the two options years.<br />A. SUPPORT IEPS DUE DILIGENCE OF COUNTRY PROGRAMS<br />Our objective is to provide geospatial technical assistance to IEPS management and staff responsible for scoping, designing, preparing and overseeing Compact and Threshold Programs. This would include, but not be limited to:<br />1) Providing technical assistance. Areas include (but are not limited to):<br />a. Opportunities to improve due diligence, decision-making, and oversight through the use of geospatial tools, technology, and information. <br />b. Assessing geospatial information needs and opportunities for an individual compact/threshold program, identifying appropriate geospatial tools and information to meet those needs, and supporting IEPS' oversight efforts involving their application.<br />c. At an IEPS Division level, assessing and selecting the appropriate technology and related software/IT platform(s) to be used for a given geospatial information objective, including the administrative requirements such as how to standup the system and coordinate responsibilities across MCC teams and contractors, MCAs and their contactors. This will include an appropriate mix of agency-approved cloud based applications (such as ESRI's ArcGIS Online, Collector, and Survey123 for ArcGIS and associated hardware, such as smartphones and GPS-enabled tablets) and desktop applications (such as ArcGIS).<br />d. Developing technical specifications and scopes of work for GIS-related work.<br />e. Day to day use of geospatial information and technology, providing authoritative guidance to IEPS staff.\r\n<p>2) Assisting implementation of geospatial work (data collection/generation, compilation and analyses) in support of IEPS involvement in program scoping, design, due diligence and oversight. Provision of related \"on-the-job\" training/mentoring for IEPS staff as appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>3) Supporting IEPS interface with other MCC units and MCA staff, contractors, and other stakeholders or outside agencies regarding geospatial systems and opportunities in Compacts and Threshold Programs, as appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>4) Travel to MCC countries to provide in country support for IEPS staff as appropriate, e.g. where the work will have relevance and applicability for multiple MCC country programs. <br />B. COORDINATION <br />IEPS's generation and use of geospatial information must be consistent with policies and systems developed by MCC. Because agency policies and systems will inform IEPS use of geospatial information, the consultant may be called upon to: <br />1) Advise IEPS Management on key opportunities, constraints and recommended courses of action for using geospatial data and technology in the development and oversight of investments.<br />2) Contribute to IEPS planning and coordination related to the use of geospatial information for due diligence and oversight. This may include geospatial standards, policy, programs and technology related to IEPS staff's core day to day tasks and objectives. <br />3) Help IEPS develop technical guidelines, standards, contract templates and other guidance essential for effective due diligence and oversight. One aim of IEPS is to adequately capture and share geospatial information consistently throughout Compacts and Threshold Programs. This may require coordination with management in other agency departments regarding relevant technical, legal and operational policies and procedures relevant to such guidelines and standards, including those related to data security and personally identifiable information (PII). <br />4) Support IEPS coordination with relevant MCC offices (e.g. DCO Front Office and Office of the Chief Information Officer). This may include (but not be limited to) guidance on technical challenges such as integration, configuration and interfacing with data storage requirements for web-based enterprise architecture applications; sharing data between MCC and overseas counterpart agencies (MCA's); advising IEPS on how to help the Agency meet relevant United States Government requirements on data collection, storage and sharing; and systems for retrieving data from contractors and consultants. <br />The contractor may be called on to perform other related duties.</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/MCC/MCCMCC/MCCMCC01/95332418Q0127/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"US","POPADDRESS":"Washington , DC"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0727","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of the Navy","OFFICE":"Naval Supply Systems Command","LOCATION":"NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk","ZIP":"22030","CLASSCOD":"D","OFFADD":"700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111","SUBJECT":"D--Oracle Discoverer Desktop + Server Edition","SOLNBR":"N00367201820121","RESPDATE":"080118","ARCHDATE":"01282019","CONTACT":"Name: Client Services, Title: Client Services, Phone: 1.877.933.3243, Fax: 703.422.7822, Email: Clientservices@fedbid.com;","DESC":"This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

The report provides information about approximately 90 \"major money laundering jurisdictions\" (a term defined by stature), focusing on the nature of each country's narcotics-related money laundering vulnerabilities and its legal, regulatory, and enforcement responses.

Past Performance: List of three Past Performance references stored in a Government performance evaluation system (if applicable).</p>\r\n<p>2. Completed RFQ Attachment No. 4: Small Business Plan (applicable - large businesses only).</p>\r\n<p>Technical is more important when compared to price.<br />The Government will evaluate technical approach adjectivally as Excellent, Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, or Unsatisfactory.<br />Although the Government reserves the right to open discussions if the Contracting Officer deems it appropriate, offerors are apprised that the Government intends to issue an award without discussions.</p>\r\n<p>FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL APPROACH</p>\r\n<p>Sub-Factor 1: Technical Approach to SIPS SOW<br />The Government will evaluate the extent the technical approach demonstrates capability to achieve all objectives, COTS solution to support FDA's SIPS program, and tasks defined in RFQ Attachment No. 1: SIPS SOW.</p>\r\n<p>Sub-Factor 2: SIPS Requirements<br />The Government will evaluate the extent the proposed product meets the salient characteristics identified in the RFQ Attachment no. 6: SIPS Requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Sub-Factor 3: 508 Compliance<br />The Government will evaluate <br />&bull; The extent the VPAT meets the standards identified for SIPS.<br />&bull; The extent the Quoter demonstrates an approach for maintaining compliance during future configurations / COTs releases.</p>\r\n<p>Sub-Factor 4: Key Personnel Resumes<br />The Government will evaluate the extent to which proposed two Key Personnel (Project Manager and Technical Lead) have appropriate experience, knowledge, certification, and identified skill sets to successfully complete activities identified in SIPS SOW.</p>\r\n<p>VOLUME II: BUSINESS QUOTE<br />The Government will evaluate the total evaluated price for Base Period activities, Option Period 1 activities, and the Option to Extend Service for 6-months. As necessary to determine prices are fair and reasonable, the Government may conduct cost analysis as described in FAR 15.404-1(c) or use other methods of price reasonableness as described in FAR 13.106-3(a)(2).</p>\r\n<p>VOLUME III: SMALL BUSINESS PLAN EVALUATION<br />In addition, if the company is a large business the Government will evaluate the extent the completed RFQ Attachment No. 4: Small Business Plan assists in meeting FDA's small business goals. An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting Officer, provide the maximum opportunity for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons to participate in the performance of the contract. If the apparently successful Quoter fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the Quoter will be ineligible for award.</p>\r\n<p>VOLUME III: PAST PERFORMANCE AS A RISK ASSESSMENT<br />The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each Quoter's Past Performance. Performance risks are those associated with an Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an Offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to the SIPS program, such as the Quoter's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the Quoter's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the Quoter's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Quoter's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Quoter's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the Offeror's performance. The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offer.</p>\r\n<p>Past Performance (Confidence Assessment Ratings):</p>\r\n<p>Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the Offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />No Confidence: Based on the Offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable or the Offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>\r\n<p>ix.

The NCI at Frederick daycare facility had a capacity of 44 children at the time it closed. Since that time, there have been recurring requests to re-open the facility. Since this facility has not been in operation since 2013 and regulations may have changed, re-opening the facility may come with added cost. The NCI at Frederick is composed of both Federal Employees and Contract Staff. There are approximately 2700 Contract Staff and approximately 600 Federal Employees that make up the staff at the NCI at Frederick. <br />There have also been requests to open a new facility at the NCI at Shady Grove. The NCI at Shady Grove does not currently have a facility, so there will need to be a site evaluation done to assess if there is a suitable location for a day care center. NCI at Shady Grove has approximately 1670 Federal Employees and 869 Contract Employees.<br />To ensure that the NCI investment in re-opening child care facility at the NCI at Frederick and/or opening a facility at the NCI at Shady Grove is reasonable, a feasibility study needs to be done.<br /><br /><strong>Contract Requirements:</strong> <br />The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br /><br />Project Management Plan:<br />1.1.1 Develop an overall project plan for the Scope of the project.

The factors, in order of importance are: technical approach, personnel and corporate experience, past performance and price. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost/price. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors to consider award to other than the lowest price offer or other than the highest technically rated factor. The Government intends to make an award to the offeror whose proposals provide the best overall value to the Government.</p>\r\n<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs set forth in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the combined synopsis/solicitation. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their quotes based on the detailed factors listed below.</p>\r\n<p>The Evaluation Process:<br /><br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this quotation to the responsible Contractor whose proposal conforming to the quotation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate the prospective Contractors and are listed in order of importance.</p>\r\n<p>1. Technical Approach (60)<br />2.

Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel.</p>\r\n<p>Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:</p>\r\n<p>a. Name of Contracting Organization<br />b. Contract Number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number)<br />c. Contract Type<br />d. Total Contract Value<br />e. Description of Requirement<br />f. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number<br />g. Program Manager's Name and Telephone Number<br />h. North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS)</p>\r\n<p>The Offeror will provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the Offeror's corrective actions.</p>\r\n<p>Each Offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services.

Price (Price will be evaluated separately but not scored)</p>\r\n<p>Price Evaluation: Offerors price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For pricing to be considered reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to the price in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/RCB/N02CO82585-73/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0803","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Health and Human Services","OFFICE":"National Institutes of Health","LOCATION":"National Library of Medicine","ZIP":"20894","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"54171","OFFADD":"6707 Democracy Blvd., Suite 105 Bethesda MD 20894","SUBJECT":"Evaluating Low-Cost X-ray Imaging in Resource-challenged Remote Regions for Automated Machine Learning-based Decision-Making","SOLNBR":"NIHLM201800081KB","RESPDATE":"080918","CONTACT":"Keturah D.

PEA L is the 2018 Heliophysics Technology Demonstration (TechDemo) Mission of Opportunity, a new opportunity to propose Principal Investigator (PI)-led investigations under a not-to-exceed cost cap. Evaluation and down selection for flight will be made through a two-step competitive process. It is anticipated that two or more TechDemo investigations will be selected for a nine-month, $400K Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 dollars, Phase A concept study through this AO. At the conclusion of these concept studies, it is planned that one or two TechDemo investigations will be selected to continue into Phase B and subsequent mission phases. A TechDemo investigation proposed PI-Managed Mission Cost (PIMMC), including all mission phases, is expected to range from $25M-$65M. Multiple missions may be down-selected if the sum of the cost of all of these missions remains below the overall PEA Cost Cap of $65M. TechDemo investigations will launch on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). Accommodation on the EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) Grande will be provided at no cost to proposers.\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<p>The TechDemo PEA solicits Small Complete Mission (SCM) proposals for spaceflight demonstration of innovative medium Technical Readiness Level (mid-TRL) technologies that enable significant advances in NASA's Heliophysics Science Objectives and Goals as described in <em>2014 Science Plan for NASA's Science Mission Directorate and Our Dynamic Space Environment: Heliophysics Science and Technology Roadmap for 2014-2033</em>. TechDemo investigations must be proposed for flight as a secondary payload with the IMAP mission. Up to two ports on an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) will be provided to accommodate each investigation. The ESPA is intended to be an unpowered, non-propulsive, ESPA Grande ring. TechDemo SCM releases will not occur until after the release of IMAP.</p>\r\n<p>Proposal merit in this PEA will be determined by the magnitude of heliophysics science advancements enabled by the proposed TechDemo investigation. Initiation of a future mission achieving the science advancements enabled by the TechDemo investigation must be technically and scientifically feasible within the next 15 years. The TechDemo investigation might inform the mission recommendations of the next heliophysics decadal study by raising the TRL of a key technology to the point it is no longer considered a defining risk to those missions. However, significant science advancement is also possible within the TechDemo investigation itself. Whether the targeted science advancement is achieved during the TechDemo mission or during some future mission within the specified timeframe will not be a factor in the evaluation criteria.</p>\r\n<p>This opportunity solicits proposals for investigations requiring the development and operation of space-based investigations. The projects are designated as Category 3 as defined in NPR 7120.5E, <em>NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management Requirements</em>. The payloads are designated as Streamlined Class D as defined in the new <em>NASA Science Mission (SMD) Class-D Tailoring/Streamlining Decision Memorandum</em>.  <br />See <strong>https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/ClassD.html</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>As NASA expects investigations proposed to this solicitation to require more development than in non-technology demonstration solicitations, proposals may spend up to 30% of the PIMMC prior to KDP-C. In each investigation, a 30% minimum unencumbered cost reserve on Phases A-D and a 20% minimum unencumbered cost reserve on Phases E-F will be required within the proposed PIMMC.</p>\r\n<p>A Preproposal Web Conference for HPTDMO is scheduled for August 24, 2018.

PEA M is the 2018 Heliophysics Science Mission of Opportunity NNH17ZDA004O-HPSMO. Notification proposals are due by September 17, 2018.\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<p>SALMON-3 is an omnibus AO that provides a solicitation and procurement base for modest investigations, also referred to as Missions of Opportunity (MO), requiring space flight that advance the high priority science and technology objectives of NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD).</p>\r\n<p>The Heliophysics Division conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations in SMD's heliophysics programs under a not-to-exceed cost cap. Proposals submitted in response to this PEA will be selected for flight through a two-step competitive process. Proposals will undergo the first step evaluation. As the outcome of the first step evaluation, NASA intends to select two or more MO investigations to proceed to a nine-month Phase A concept study. In the second step, NASA will conduct an evaluation of the Phase A concept study reports. From this evaluation, NASA expects to down-select at least two MOs to proceed into Phase B and subsequent mission phases, at least one of which will be an SCM utilizing NASA-PEA-provided Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) Grande access to space. A Science investigation proposed PI-Managed Mission Cost (PIMMC), including all mission phases, is expected to range from $35M-$75M. Multiple missions may be selected if their total cost remains below the overall PEA cost cap. Science investigations are encouraged to use the launch capability on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV).</p>\r\n<p>Heliophysics Science investigations must address NASA's heliophysics science objectives as described in <em>2014 Science Plan for NASA's Science Mission Directorate and Our Dynamic Space Environment: Heliophysics Science and Technology Roadmap for 2014-2033</em>. Consistent with these documents, investigations should focus on understanding the Sun and its interactions with Earth and the solar system, including space weather.</p>\r\n<p>Investigations may target any heliophysics scientific investigation that advances the objectives of this PEA. Investigations that address NASA goals in other areas, such as astrophysics, Earth science, or planetary science, are not solicited.</p>\r\n<p>Three Mission of Opportunity types may be proposed in response to this PEA: (1) Partner Missions of Opportunity (PMOs), which may include CubeSats and International Space Station (ISS) payloads, (2) New Missions using Existing Spacecraft (NMESs), and (3) Small Complete Missions (SCMs).

Acceleration of these technologies from scientific laboratory to potentially commercialize-able opportunities requires the simultaneous performance of collaborative research and development of technologies and the entrepreneurial development of the innovators working on these technologies.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chain Reaction Innovations is an energy materials and manufacturing innovation program that serves as a platform for supporting and mentoring entrepreneurial researchers whose early-stage innovations are too challenging or technically uncertain to pursue in a venture capital-financed startup. Chain Reaction Innovations embeds innovators within a National Laboratory technology eco-system for up to two-years, working with innovators as they advance their early stage scientific discoveries to potentially commercialize-able opportunities within a discrete time period, enabling the translation of high-impact materials and manufacturing technologies through entrepreneurial mentorship and cooperative research and development. Technology innovators are selected into the program through an annual competition, which is the purpose of this solicitation. The Chain Reaction Innovations program intends to provide selected technology innovators with scientific/technical mentorship and access to unique R&amp;D assets and scientific expertise at Argonne, a Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory, to incubate and translate innovations from proof-of-concept to proof-of-product.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Opportunity <br /></strong>Chain Reaction Innovations, in partnership with business mentors, will help selected innovators in the physical sciences and energy technologies to mature their early stage innovations. As part of Chain Reaction Innovations, the Department of Energy will directly fund Argonne to work with each selected innovator to develop their technology. Additionally, the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) will provide an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) fellowship to the selected innovators for the first year, with the possibility for support for a total of up to 2 years through this program It is expected that the period of fellowship support of the innovator to be coincident with the period of performance for the supported research at Argonne. Argonne is presently looking for up to four to five innovators for its third cohort of the Chain Reaction Innovation program.</p>\r\n<p>Additional benefits to selected innovators may include:</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to 2 years of Chain Reaction Innovations resources (subject to performance &amp;&nbsp;availability of funding) including the following:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Personal stipend, travel allowance, and health benefits through ORISE <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fellowship;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Lab space &amp; technical collaboration support from Argonne National Laboratory;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Chain Reaction Innovations programming and mentorship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Continued benefits after \"graduating\" for up to 5 years in total (innovators will&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; graduate after the earlier of 2 years in the program or upon raising $2M in <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; cumulative private-sector funding, whichever is earlier) and may include the&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; following:</p>\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in\">o Continued technical collaboration support from Argonne National Laboratory through <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) on a pay-in basis;</p>\r\n<p style=\"TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in\">o On-site Chain Reaction Innovations lab occupancy on a pay-in basis; or&nbsp;<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in\">o Access to Chain Reaction Innovations programming on a pay-in basis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Each of the above is contingent upon availability of funds and personnel, negotiation of a mutually agreeable scope of work, as well as DOE approval.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Application Materials </strong></p>\r\n<p>Innovator applicants must submit the following materials:</p>\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin\"><span>&bull;&bull;<span style=\"FONT: 7pt \">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong>You </strong>(page 1): Provide the back story on you and your project.

Since no hard R&amp;D is allowed in this phase, background Intellectual Property (IP) will not be of concern. Innovators are expected to develop an Intellectual Property (IP) Management Plan as part of the Scope and Planning phase (budget period 1), subject to the appropriate DOE Technology Manager's approval with concurrence from DOE Patent Counsel, before proceeding to the R&amp;D phase (budget period 2). The IP Management Plan should identify and provide a path for obtaining any background IP rights, if necessary, that may be needed to perform R&amp;D work under the CRADA and commercialize their technology.</p>\r\n<p>In some cases, this phase may be short or not needed at all.</p>\r\n<p><em>R&amp;D Phase: </em></p>\r\n<p>Once the Scope and Planning phase has been completed (or if it is not needed), the R&amp;D Phase of the project can proceed (subject to DOE approval).</p>\r\n<p>Please note that as with any other cooperative research and development project conducted with a National Lab, an innovator's failure to abide by its DOE approved IP Management Plan could result in delayed work, deferment or removal from the program. Please note that selected innovators do not have any rights to Lab or third party background IP by virtue of selection or participation in this program. If an innovator requires any Lab background IP they should reach out to the Lab's technology transfer office.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Business Mentorship </strong></p>\r\n<p>Selected innovators will be encouraged to engage with a business mentor organization that meets the qualifications set by Chain Reaction Innovations soon after joining of the program Business mentors are encouraged, but not required for participation in CRI.

This research support covers a wide range of issues, including 1) understanding the design and impacts of energy policies, 2) understanding the impacts of DOE RDD&amp;D programs on the adoption of renewable energy or energy efficient technologies, 3) identifying market impacts on future generation technology deployment and utilization in the U.S. electricity system, 4) estimating renewable integration challenges and opportunities for new technologies and practices, and 5) quantifying the physical and economic impacts of different future electricity generation scenarios.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: \">One of the primary models used to conduct and support this analysis is the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model, a detailed optimization tool developed and maintained by staff at NREL. ReEDS is a capacity expansion model of the North American electricity system and is used to generate future deployment scenarios for a large suite of power generation technologies-coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, geothermal, and others-and other electric system infrastructure-e.g., energy storage and transmission. It considers multiple complex and interacting factors in its economic decision-making. These factors include technology costs, fuel prices, policies and incentives, and the incumbent system existing in multiple interconnected regions. ReEDS scenarios are used to inform the broad set of research questions of interest to the DOE and other project sponsors. ReEDS has been used as the primary analytic tool for studies resulting in about 70 publications since 2012.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Podgorica, Montenegro<br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>\r\n<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR<br />The Department of State (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is the Bureau charged with foreign policy development relating to international crime, drug trafficking, corruption, criminal justice reform, post-conflict/civilian policing, and related issues. In Montenegro, and throughout the Balkans, INL supports criminal justice sector reforms and facilitates effective cross-border and regional law enforcement cooperation. In Montenegro, INL provides training, technical, and material support to police, prosecutors, and judges. INL has a wide array of partners in this effort, including other U.S. agencies, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and commercial providers.</p>\r\n<p>Montenegro is an active recipient of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding. INCLE funding assists countries in their fight against transnational crime and illicit threats, including efforts against terrorist networks, the illegal drug trade, and other illicit enterprises. Embassy Podgorica receives approximately $1.8M in INCLE funding for an INL justice and a police program, implemented by the Department of Justice's Office of International Criminal Investigative Training and Assistance Program (ICITAP). Montenegro, like every other candidate state for the European Union (EU), must demonstrate its capacity to fight organized crime and corruption and bolster public confidence in its justice sector institutions. INL's capacity-building programs are critical for achieving these goals.</p>\r\n<p>Since its independence in 2006, Montenegro has made, and continues to make, fundamental reforms to its criminal justice sector in order to bring it in line with Euro-Atlantic standards. Nevertheless, the establishment of an effective rule of law system in Montenegro remains an unfinished process due to: (a) the continuing presence and strength of transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) operating in Montenegro, which threaten Montenegro, the region, and the U.S. homeland; (b) widespread and endemic corruption, which negatively affects U.S. policy interests in the region by engendering instability; and (c) malign foreign influence from Russia that seeks to take advantage of institutional weaknesses in Montenegro due to the presence of such TCOs and corruptive practices.</p>\r\n<p>While Montenegro is moving in the right direction, its ultimate success is not guaranteed. As both the newest NATO member and an aspiring EU Member, Montenegro has already accomplished significant rule of law reforms as part of the Euro-Atlantic integration process. However, U.S. assistance and support is vital to ensure Montenegro integrates successfully into Euro-Atlantic institutions and remain an example for the region.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this position is to provide a Senior Justice Advisor to U.S. Embassy Podgorica who will serve as the central role in developing and implementing INL programs to support Montenegro's judicial reforms and other rule-of-law initiatives that will help further Montenegro's progress toward EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership. This program will focus on developing the capacity of Montenegro to fight corruption and organized crime through mentoring and practical training for prosecutors and judges. The Advisor will also be expected to formulate innovative, targeted, and sustainable approaches for building the rule of law in Montenegro, including improving the efficiency and quality of criminal proceedings, institutional strengthening and development, and countering malign Russian influence.<br /><br />DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br />1. Serve as the INL Senior Justice Advisor within INL/EA's overall assistance mission in Montenegro.</p>\r\n<p>2.

Establish and maintain relationships with Montenegrin justice sector and other government officials, including prosecutors, investigators, judges, parliamentarians, and Justice Ministry officials. Provide day-to-day subject matter expertise on legislative reform pertaining to the reform of the justice sector.</p>\r\n<p>6. Develop assistance programs for prosecutors concerning the investigation and prosecution of cases. Ensure program activities develop local capacity. Conduct local case study workshops, conferences, and a guest speaker series that develops the Montenegrin prosecutors' trial preparation skills and on the implementation of new criminal procedure code tools such as task forces, prosecutor-led investigations, plea bargaining and cross-examination.</p>\r\n<p>7. Manage rule-of-law programs for Montenegro in partnership and coordination with other implementers in the international donor community, including the European Commission, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other countries. Coordinate with local civil society organizations to develop an understanding of their challenges and needs, assess political developments in the country, plus opportunities for INL support.

Assist Montenegro in attaining EU accession goals by meeting EU benchmarks related to judicial reform and fair trials by hosting local workshops and practical case studies.

As a result of such communication, the Government may allow offerors to submit quote revisions. If quote revisions are allowed, the Government may, solely at its discretion, impose non-common due dates for the revisions. In other words, the Government may elect to have a quote revision date for an offeror that is different than the quote revision date for another offeror(s). The Government need not conduct communications with all offerors. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion, conduct communications with one or only some offerors.

It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>\r\n<p>(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>\r\n<p>(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>\r\n<p>(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>\r\n<p>(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>\r\n<p>(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>\r\n<p>(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>\r\n<p>(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>\r\n<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>\r\n<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>\r\n<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>\r\n<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>\r\n<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>\r\n<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>\r\n<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>\r\n<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>\r\n<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>\r\n<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>\r\n<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>\r\n<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>\r\n<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>\r\n<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>\r\n<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>\r\n<p>f.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>\r\n<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>\r\n<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>\r\n<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>\r\n<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/982283bdc1fcd5ceb596beb82a5fac49","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"US","POPZIP":"27909","POPADDRESS":"USCG Aviation Logistics Center/ ALD Procurement \r\n1664 Weeksville Road \nElizabeth City, NC"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0815","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Veterans Affairs","OFFICE":"VA Technology Acquisition Center","LOCATION":"VA Technology Acquisition Center","ZIP":"07724","CLASSCOD":"D","NAICS":"541519","OFFADD":"Department of Veterans Affairs;Technology Acquisition Center;23 Christopher Way;Eatontown NJ  07724","SUBJECT":"D--VA.GOV Modernization","SOLNBR":"36C10B18Q3117","ARCHDATE":"10142018","CONTACT":"Kelly Reale\nContract Specialist\n732-440-9712\n\n<a href=\"mailto:kelly.reale@va.gov\">kelly.reale@va.gov</a>","DESC":"36C10B18Q3117\nPage 1 of \nPage 1 of 1\nPage 1 of \nSee attached combined synopsis/solicitation for VA.gov Modernization","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/cc83b58a452d2419bd883cd9993b6aba","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"kelly.reale@va.gov","DESC3":"kelly.reale@va.gov","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0816","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of the Army","OFFICE":"Army Contracting Command","LOCATION":"ACC - APG (W56JSR) Division E","ZIP":"21005-1846","CLASSCOD":"D","NAICS":"541519","OFFADD":"6565 Surveillance Loop\r\nBuilding 6001\r\n Aberdeen Proving Ground MD 21005-1846","SUBJECT":"VMWARE VSPHERE","SOLNBR":"W56JSR18Q0084","RESPDATE":"082318","CONTACT":"Sean M.

This is intended to support the GoSL's decisions on land policy and legal reform actions and other support activities as outlined in the RFQ.  A policy paper on the benefits to investment and economic activity created by converting these rights in state land to wholly freehold rights will support the GoSL initiatives to adopt this reform and establish a streamlined procedure to implement it.

The mission of the consortium will include performing research, development, and test and evaluation within prototyping projects that address requirements presented by, or of interest to, the US Government.</p>\r\n<p>(b) It is the Government's intention to enter into an OT agreement with only one consortium manager that can best meet the Government's defined scope provided below. By definition, a consortium is an organized group of entities that agree to participate under a common rule set. The consortium should be open to new membership and display a broad array of expertise and experience connected to the domains identified herein. Prospective members must agree to the terms of the consortium. A consortium comprised of educational, nonprofit, and commercial organizations with broad and open membership is required to provide the Government a partner able to collaborate across barriers that include military/civilian, public/private, local/regional/national, and political/jurisdictional matters and concerns.</p>\r\n<p>(c) The Consortium Manager can be an individual, a for profit organization, or a not-for-profit corporation. The consortium manager will serve as an independent agent of the Government and will not be eligible to compete for project awards. The consortium manager will serve as the broker for the individual prototype project agreements. In other words, the Government sends the funds to the consortium manager; the consortium manager takes the appropriate fee for service per the terms set forth in the consortium OT agreement; and the consortium manager then delivers the remaining funds to the performers per the terms of the project transaction.</p>\r\n<p>(d) The Government anticipates that ACI will be awarded as an Other Transaction (OT) Agreement for Prototype Projects, as authorized under 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371b. The resulting agreement is expected to be valued at a maximum funding ceiling of $100M, with a performance period of one year base period of performance with four, one-year options (for a total of five years). Note: this ceiling is likely to grow to $500M or higher. It is anticipated that this OT agreement will be funded on a Firm Fixed Price basis, in increments, with pricing based on the outcome of an indefinite number of individual prototype project-level competitions and individual prototype project agreements. Despite the Firm Fixed Price nature of the Agreement, the consortium manager will need to identify an accounting system that is capable of tracking the receipt of Government funding and the resolution of milestone payments.</p>\r\n<p>(e) Deliverables are expected to consist nearly entirely of prototypes (software, hardware, and/or technical documentation). Periodic reports will be required for the overall program.</p>\r\n<p>2. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES</p>\r\n<p>(a) The United States Air Force has identified the need for an AFLCMC OT Consortium to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the military aviation acquisition process. This consortium would perform critical research, development, test, and evaluation within prototyping projects supporting the AFLCMC mission areas identified within Section 2(b) below. The core objective of ACI is to create a mutually beneficial environment between the Government and industry/academia that fosters collaboration to close the gap between existing technology/capability and performance threshold requirements within the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center's (AFLCMC's) mission sets detailed in section 2(b) below.</p>\r\n<p>(b) The scope of AFLCMC prototyping projects might include any topic generally consistent with the research, development, test and evaluation within prototyping projects of the AFLCMC mission sets. These mission sets include, but are not limited to: weapon system and commercial derivative aircraft platforms; battle management; simulators; human systems; clothing/uniforms; business enterprise systems; command, control, communications, intelligence and networks; armament, support equipment and vehicles; automatic test systems; electronic warfare and avionics; information, surveillance, reconnaissance and special operations; aircraft integration, and aircraft subsystems. It is anticipated that ACI will promote competition for individual prototype projects through a two-step white paper/proposal process.</p>\r\n<p>(c) AFLCMC aims to take advantage of the inherent flexibility afforded by other transactions for prototyping authority to achieve the following general objectives.<br />&bull; Expose AFLCMC requirements to, and lower barriers to entry for, the broad community of traditional and nontraditional solution providers.<br />&bull; Encourage rapid solicitation to award timelines.<br />&bull; Employ objective, test-based, Validation and Verification as basis of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), trade analysis, source selection, and performance monitoring.<br />&bull; Develop Intellectual Property Regimes (IPR) and Data Rights that incentivize mutually beneficial government-industry partnership.<br />&bull; Transition successfully tested prototype applications as vendor-supported off-the-shelf products.<br />&bull; Continuously evolve an appropriately \"open\" technical architecture that optimizes government investment by both leveraging best available existing commercial technology and developing new technology in partnership with industry.<br />&bull; Minimize risk of technology perishability by executing rapid, iterative, evolutionary, demonstration-to-delivery cycles.</p>\r\n<p>3. LIMITATIONS OF OT AUTHORITY</p>\r\n<p>(a) Individual project-level agreements issued under the resulting OT Agreement must be limited to prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense, or improvements to the platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.</p>\r\n<p>(b) To the maximum extent practicable, the individual prototype projects shall be awarded on a competitive basis, in order to provide for the opportunity to award a follow-on prototype agreement or follow-on production contract or transaction to the participants in the individual prototype projects. Further, the individual prototype projects may provide for prototypes or follow-on production items to be provided to another contractor as Government-furnished equipment.</p>\r\n<p>(c) At least one third of the total cost of each prototype project is to be paid out of funds provided by sources other than the Federal Government unless one of the following applies:</p>\r\n<p>a. There is at least one nontraditional defense contractor or nonprofit research institution participating to a significant extent in the prototype project;</p>\r\n<p>b. All significant participants in the transaction other than the Federal Government are small businesses (including small business participating in a program described under section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638)); or</p>\r\n<p>c. The senior procurement executive for the agency determines in writing that exceptional circumstances justify the use of a transaction that provides for innovative business arrangements or structures that would not be feasible or appropriate under a contract, or would provide an opportunity to expand the defense supply base in a manner that would not be practical or feasible under a contract.</p>\r\n<p>(d) For purposes of these limitations identified in Sections 3(a)-3(c) above, the following definitions apply:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Prototype Project / Individual Prototype Project - A prototype project can generally be described as a preliminary pilot, test, evaluation, demonstration, or agile development activity used to evaluate the technical or manufacturing feasibility or military utility of a technology, process, concept, end item, effect, or other discrete feature. Prototype projects may include systems, subsystems, components, materials, methodology, technology, or processes. A prototype project may involve a: proof of concept; a pilot; a novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes; a creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility; or combinations of the foregoing, related to a prototype. <br />&bull; Small Business - a small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This definition also includes small businesses participating in a program described under section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638), e.g., Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program participants.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; \"Directly relevant to enhancing military capabilities\" - development that enhances mission effectiveness of military personnel and supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense, or improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the Armed Forces.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Nontraditional Defense Contractor - any entity that is not currently performing and has not performed, for at least one year preceding solicitation of this agreement, any contract or subcontract subject to the full Cost Accounting Standards coverage required by 41 U.S.C. &sect; 1502.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; \"Participating to a significant extent\" - supplying new key technology or products; accomplishing a significant amount of the effort; causing a material reduction in the cost or schedule, and/or causing an increase in the performance of the work effort. In order to be relieved of the one third cost share requirement, the prime traditional contractor must submit documentation describing the significant participation of the nontraditional contractor, which must be approved by the cognizant Agreements Officer.</p>\r\n<p>4.

Proposed consortium membership fees; and</p>\r\n<p>d. Proposed consortium membership requirements</p>\r\n<p>5. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>\r\n<p>(a) The government will perform an integrated assessment of each proposal to make a final determination of which consortium provides the best value to the Government. For evaluation purposes, the following criteria will be assessed, in no relative order of importance:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Factor 1: Strategy for attracting, retaining, and expanding consortium membership. The Government will evaluate the consortium manager's strategy as it relates to the openness of the consortium, in particular the ease with which new members are able to join and participate; specific actions intended to expedite formation of the consortium; specific actions intended to ensure the consortium membership aligns with the mission areas identified above; and plans to grow and mature the consortium membership base.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Factor 2: Strategy for coordinating and assisting activities of consortium members at the individual prototype project level. The Government will evaluate the consortium's strategy as it relates to the processes by which the consortium will assist the project-level member with proposal preparation, proposal analysis, co-development and integration, test and evaluation, progress reporting, invoicing and expedited payments, intellectual property, and project close-out.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Factor 3: Schedule for the consortium to be established. The Government will evaluate the proposed consortium implementation plan and timeline to determine when the consortium will be capable of competing Government prototype requirements. The Government intends to solicit for individual prototype projects upon execution of the consortium OT agreement.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Factor 4: Recommended competition processes and operational procedures. The Government will evaluate the proposed competition process and operational procedures for prototype projects that the consortium believes is the best fit for the consortium OT agreement.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Factor 5: Organizational and fee structure of the consortium. The Government will evaluate the proposed organizational and fee structure of the consortium, to include Consortium Metrics, Management Framework of Consortium, Reporting, Articles of Collaboration/By-Laws, Consortium Member Agreement, innovative fee structures designed to incentivize achievement of government objectives, and any other relative information on how the consortium intends to operate. A consortium managed by a Consortium Management Firm is preferred.</p>\r\n<p>6. EVALUATION RATINGS</p>\r\n<p>Each of the six factors identified in Section 5 above will receive an evaluation rating supported by justification in the Government's decision of which one consortium best meets the Government's needs. The following ratings will be utilized:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Good: The proposal demonstrates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. The prospective consortium has provided a comprehensive and detailed plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Acceptable: The proposal demonstrates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The prospective consortium has provided an adequate plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Unacceptable: The proposal does not demonstrate an ability to meet or understand the Government requirements. The prospective consortium did not provide a plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high.</p>\r\n<p>7. COMMUNICATIONS WITH OFFERORS AND FINAL PROPOSAL REVISIONS</p>\r\n<p>The Government will perform an initial review of the proposal(s) submitted. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on the initial proposals submitted in response to this synopsis/solicitation notice without further interactions. Proposals that do not contain the information requested are at risk of being determined Unacceptable in accordance with the evaluation ratings above. If the Government determines that further interactions and/or an opportunity to revise proposals is necessary, the Government reserves the right to contact all, some, or none of the offerors and/or request proposal revisions.</p>\r\n<p>8. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>\r\n<p>(a) Government Property: Government Property is not currently being provided. It is not anticipated that the consortium manager will require access to Government Property in order to carry out its role in this acquisition. Use of Government Property may be considered for individual project agreements. Terms and conditions regarding the tracking, use, disposition, and title to Government Property will be included in the resulting agreement to provide the framework for providing Government Property to individual project prototype performers. It is understood and accepted that time may be needed to implement Government Property requirements upon the first instance of property being provided. It is also understood that projects that require Government Property may take longer to award than those without property requirements.</p>\r\n<p>(b) Security Clearance/Classification: The consortium manager will be responsible for coordinating clearance verification, access, and safeguarding of required classified resources. Tracking and disposition of this support will be the consortium manager's responsibility upon conclusion of the individual prototype project effort(s). Base Support and Government network access are not anticipated for the consortium manager or the individual prototype project performers at this time.</p>\r\n<p>(c) Intellectual Property: with the exception of commercial software, which will be handled through commercial licensing, all software and technical data developed by the consortium manager or the individual prototype project performers is anticipated to be delivered with the following Government Purpose Rights: the rights to</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation within the Government without restriction; and<br />&bull; Release or disclose technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation for United States Government purpose. <br />This definition applies to noncommercial technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation.<br />The Government reserves its right to negotiate intellectual property rights that differ from what is described above, as necessary.<br />(d) Accreditation:</p>\r\n<p>Performers should note that some military information systems require access to source code for accreditation purposes. Accreditation is a part of security testing for certain Information Systems. The accreditation process is tailored to each new Information System, so the need for source code must be determined on a case-by-case basis and will vary based on the system program office associated with each project. The Government will make every attempt to identify the extent to which code will be required to complete accreditation and provide this information with the initial prototype project announcement. Any source code requirements will be captured in the project approval letter that the Government will send to the consortium manager following selection of a successful proposal. In such cases, source code requirements will also be included in the individual prototype project agreement between the consortium manager and the individual prototype project performer.</p>\r\n<p>(e) Organizational Conflicts of Interest:</p>\r\n<p>All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest must be disclosed (i.e., Offerors must disclose those situations in which, because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person or organization is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person or organization's objectivity in performing the agreement work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person or organization has an unfair competitive advantage). The disclosure shall include a description of the potential conflict as well as the action the Offeror has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. Proposals that fail to fully disclose potential conflicts of interest and/or do not have plans to mitigate this conflict may be rejected without evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout performance, the consortium manager will be required to monitor potential conflicts of interest between its individual project level performers and the contractors currently developing for and operating the targeted systems.</p>\r\n<p>9. SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>\r\n<p>(a) Specific terms and conditions of the resulting OT agreement will be negotiated and finalized with the selected consortium prior to award.</p>\r\n<p>(b) The Government intends to make a 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371b OT agreement based on proposals submitted in response to this competitive combined synopsis/solicitation notice. All information in response to this notice is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government will publish an Intent to Award Announcement to FedBizOpps upon selection of a consortium in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government does not intend to provide debriefings to unsuccessful respondents. A notice of the Government's consortium award selection will be announced on FedBizOpps upon the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>\r\n<p>(c) Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. No sensitive or classified information will be discussed. Foreign-owned, controlled, or influenced firms are advised that security restrictions may apply that may preclude their participation in these efforts.</p>\r\n<p>(d) The most effective time to handle potential problems is during the proposal preparation stage, i.e., prior to the proposal due date, not in the proposal. Therefore, if a prospective Offeror believes that any conflict of interest exists or may exist (whether organizational or otherwise), the Offeror is strongly encouraged to promptly raise the issue with the Agreements Officer by sending Offeror's contact information and a summary of the potential conflict by email to kari.wedemeyer@us.af.mil before time and effort are expended in preparing a proposal and mitigation plan. If, in the sole opinion of the Government after full consideration of the circumstances (including review of the Offeror's mitigation plan), any conflict situation cannot be effectively mitigated, the proposal may be returned without evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award under this combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>\r\n<p>(e) For planning purposes only, offerors should assume an award date of 6 November 2018; however, proposals in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be assumed to be valid for 180 days from receipt of offer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/ASC/FA8604-19-R-4050/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"COMBINE":{"DATE":"0820","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","OFFICE":"Ames Research Center","LOCATION":"Office of Procurement","ZIP":"94035-1000","CLASSCOD":"D","NAICS":"541715","OFFADD":"NASA/Ames Research Center, JA:M/S 241-1 Moffett Field CA 94035-1000","SUBJECT":"Radio Frequency Channel Emulator (RFCE)","SOLNBR":"80ARC018Q0008","RESPDATE":"090418","CONTACT":"Daniel \"Paden\" Chang, Contract Specialist , Phone 6506040395, Email daniel.p.chang@nasa.gov - Uyen Tu, Contracting Officer, Phone 6506044958, Fax 6506040912, Email uyen.k.tu@nasa.gov","DESC":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for radio frequency channel emulator (RFCE).<br /><br />Statement of Work</p>\r\n<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>\r\n<p>NASA Ames Research Center has identified autonomous swarms of rovers, drones, and spacecraft as an important architecture/technology that can enable new types of missions, expand capabilities of existing technologies, and reduce costs of hardware and operations. The center currently has two projects to develop enabling technologies for swarms: Connected, Autonomous, Smart Aerospace Systems (CASAS), a center directed activity to build up the infrastructure, process, and capability of autonomous swarms for space and aeronautics; and Starling, a Small Spacecraft Technology Program (SSTP) and Space Technology Mission Directory (STMD) funded mission to develop technologies that enable autonomous swarm operations.</p>\r\n<p>The fundamental capability for any swarm operation is the ability for all the nodes (individual satellites or drones) to communicate with each other, much like we can using the internet or cell phones. Traditional communication between nodes in aerospace has been achieved by specialized protocols and hardware or managed through ground operations. Both approaches are difficult to adapt and expensive to scale for large numbers of nodes. New approaches are needed to enable network communications on a swarm that is flexible and robust.</p>\r\n<p>Code TI has a requirement to develop a radio frequency (RF) communication system for swarms of spacecraft and drones in support of Starling and CASAS. Due to regulation requirements and difficulty simulating realistic RF communication, an advanced RF channel emulator is needed. The projects will use the channel emulator as a testbed to develop Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) solutions for these missions. The emulator will enable the projects to evaluate communication protocols, estimate swarm capabilities, test and mitigate risks prior to flight, and run realistic simulations using flight-like hardware in high-fidelity models of the environment. The simulations include scenarios to test the effectiveness of the hardware and protocols while performing mission activities.</p>\r\n<p>2. SCOPE</p>\r\n<p>Requirements</p>\r\n<p>The channel emulator must have the following features in order to test the MANET:</p>\r\n<p>- Support frequency bands found in space and terrestrial applications<br />&bull; Preferably 100MHz to 12GHz<br />&bull; Accept 100MHz to 4GHz (S-Band)<br />- Support bandwidth up to 200MHz<br />- Support at least 16 RF nodes<br />&bull; Upgradable to reduce initial costs and allow expansion at later date<br />&#61607; Fully configured system support 96+ RF<br />- Allow customizable protocols<br />- Interface with simulation tools for realistic communication in mission scenarios<br />- Model and emulate physical effects found in aeronautics and space based communication<br />&bull; Propagation delays<br />&bull; Doppler effects<br />&bull; Interference <br />&bull; Power dissipation<br />- Work with Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) and Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator (EMANE) for reuse of existing network models <br />&bull; Integrate and model virtual nodes for large scale simulations<br />- Documentation to include<br />&bull; Users Manual<br />&bull; Application Programming Interface (API) Documentation</p>\r\n<p>Deliverables:</p>\r\n<p>- A channel emulator which meets all the requirements above.<br />- A 12-month technical support services.</p>\r\n<p>3.

This research requires a significant, sustained effort to carry out and interrogate the results of molecular simulations for transporters so as to examine the structural dynamics of these molecular systems. Studies over the past 8 years in the Computational Structural Biology Unit have so far resulted in Terabytes of simulation data for BetP in a wide range of conditions that hold within them a wealth of untapped information. The specific aims of this project are: (a) to carry out a systematic analysis of the available molecular simulation data for BetP and thereby to identify common or unusual dynamics of the protein and its interplay with its environment, as well as regions of the protein for which the underlying structural data is ambiguous; (b) to interrogate the underlying structural data in the light of those simulations and carry out refinement of structural models using that data; and finally (c) to utilize the newly-refined structures as starting points for additional molecular simulations, and to carry out additional analysis of those simulations. Novel findings will be written and published as articles in a scientific journal.<br />The aims and deliverables of this project therefore require an individual with world-class experience not only in carrying out and analyzing molecular simulations, but also in the refinement of structural models using X-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM data using the software PHENIX and COOT. In addition, the contractor must have a detailed knowledge of the biological context of the project, namely the properties of BetP and the interplay of its function and regulation with the lipid molecules in its membrane environment, as demonstrated by authorship on published work in the biomedical literature.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /><strong>Background Information</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The research program of the Computational Structural Biology Unit in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is focused on elucidating the structural mechanisms of biomedically important molecular systems associated with cellular membranes, in part using computationally-intensive, physics-based molecular simulations.<br /><br />Membrane transport proteins are responsible for the uptake of vital nutrients and the extrusion of waste products from cells. Members of this group of proteins are responsible for termination of synaptic transmission by removing neurotransmitters from the synapse. These proteins are the targets of a range of psychoactive compounds including treatments of depression and are implicated in a range of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and addiction. In recent years insights into the detailed molecular mechanisms of these proteins have been garnered mainly through studies of bacterial proteins, which can serve as prototypes due to their similarity with neuronal proteins. One of these bacterial prototypes is the transporter of betaine, BetP, which is crucial for the response of soil bacteria to dry environmental conditions. X-ray crystallographic structures have been determined of BetP that provide snapshots from a molecular movie of its mechanistic cycle. However, much remains to be understood about how these snapshots are interconnected, and how they are controlled by the presence or absence of the betaine molecule. Moreover, BetP has complex regulatory mechanisms involving the ability to function only under certain environmental conditions, such as the presence of specific lipids in the surrounding membrane; so far, little is known about how these features affect the protein and its mechanism. Understanding of these mechanisms is expected to provide important feedback to investigations of neuronal proteins, which depend on their surroundings in similar ways.<br />The simulation method known as Molecular Dynamics (MD) is arguably the most rigorous and promising computational approach to study cellular processes at atomic resolution. The trajectories taken from such MD simulations provide a wealth of complex information that requires advanced training and expertise to interrogate and interpret. The results of these simulations also raise questions about the underlying structural data, inspiring cycles of structural refinement and model rebuilding followed by additional molecular simulations using those refined structures as starting points.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /><strong>See attached Statement of Work for further detail.</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Technical Evaluation Criteria attached</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(vi)Period of Performance: One year from date of award.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(viii)The following additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions as determined by the contracting officer are necessary for this acquisition and consistent with customary commercial practices.

This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261201600298P held by the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU).</p>\r\n<p>The Chernobyl Research Unit (CRU), DCEG REB sponsors joint U.S.-Ukraine studies of health effects of the Chernobyl Accident.  Currently, there are two partnership agreements supporting three collaborative U.S.-Ukraine epidemiological projects in Ukraine.  These projects are 1) \"Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (P004) undertaken at the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism (IEM), Kiev; 2) \"Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases Among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (P003) at the Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM), Kiev; and 3) \"Thyroid Cancer among Chernobyl Cleanup Workers in Ukraine\" (P003A) undertaken as a variation of the project name, \"Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases Among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (see below) also at RCRM.</p>\r\n<p>The partnership agreement for \"Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (P004) involves thyroid screening and other related tasks in a cohort of about 13,000 people who were exposed to post-Chernobyl radioactive fallout under age 20 years. The aim of this project is to assess early and late morphologic and functional changes in the thyroid glands of persons exposed at young ages to radiation from radioactive materials released as a consequence of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident.  The cohort members have been undergoing diagnostic thyroid examinations since 1998.  Under a rigid protocol approved by NCI, IEM staff carries out the field work to maintain contact with the cohort members and invite them to diagnostic thyroid examinations, which may include palpation, ultrasound scanning, thyroid hormone and other laboratory tests. These examinations are done at IEM or by a mobile team.  If deemed necessary by the protocol, cohort members are referred to an expert endocrinologist at IEM for a fine-needle aspiration biopsy for diagnostic confirmation.  Interview information collected by IEM regarding residential, health, diet and lifestyle history has been used for estimating radiation doses by an international expert group involving NCI.  Follow-up is also performed on all subjects for thyroid cancer morbidity and mortality through linkage with the national cancer registry in Ukraine. The IEM is responsible for the tracing of cohort subjects, recording medical and other data, data processing, and database management and organizing analytical data for NCI. IEM collects fresh and/or archived samples for study by NCI genetic and genomic investigations.  IEM also provides data management and quality control, services needed for radiation dose reconstruction to be undertaken by NCI and other dosimetry experts and assist data analysis and manuscript preparations for NCI.</p>\r\n<p>The partnership project agreement for \"Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (P003) involves a case-control study of leukemia among clean-up workers carried out by RCRM staff.  The objective of this study is to assess the risk of leukemia and other hematological cancers related to radiation exposure that the clean-up workers received during the recovery and clean-up operations after the accident.  Data collection undertaken by RCRM is nearly completed, and major study results showing a significant risk of leukemia associated with radiation exposure have been published.  The RCRM continues to provide additional data and/or biological samples for analyses performed by NCI.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, an amendment has been made to the above agreement with RCRM to add a case-control study of thyroid cancer in the same clean-up worker population, \"Thyroid Cancer among Chernobyl Cleanup Workers in Ukraine\" (P003A).  Under the protocol approved by NCI, RCRM staff conducts field work to identify cases with thyroid cancer and non-cancer controls, interview them for radiation exposure information, and collect saliva samples for future genetic studies.  In addition, under the protocol approved by NCI, RCRM acquire and store archival thyroid tumor tissues and other biological samples for NCI genetic research (\"Tissue Archiving\").  The RCRM also provides data management and quality control, services needed for radiation dose reconstruction to be undertaken by NCI and other dosimetry experts and assist data analysis and manuscript preparations for NCI.</p>\r\n<p>In all three projects, NCI is responsible for study design and methodologies while the Contractor shall implement an un-interrupted continuation of these projects under a Partner Project Agreement, providing technical and financial management for the projects in Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>As set forth in the agreement signed by the United States, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine, funds received by the Recipients (RCRM and IEM) in Ukraine from the NCI, in connection with the contractors projects, shall be excluded in determining the profits of the contractor for the purpose of tax liability and funds received by persons shall not be included in these persons taxable incomes.  The allocation of intellectual property arising from the agreement and the responsibilities for protecting and exploiting such intellectual property have been negotiated between the Recipient and the Partner.  Exploitation of results shall be limited to applications for peaceful purposes, and the Recipient and the NCI shall ensure that any results that could result in concerns over proliferations of weapons technology and transfer of sensitive technologies will be protected in accordance with Ukrainian laws and international agreements.</p>\r\n<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF PROCUREMENT<br />The objective of this procurement is to obtain severable support services to provide technical and financial management oversight for the four NCI supported projects in Ukraine: (1) follow-up for thyroid cancer and related activities projects/activities (including genomic and in utero studies) in individuals exposed to radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident; and (2) leukemia and other hematologic diseases among clean-up workers in Ukraine following the Chernobyl accident and related studies and activities, including data collection and analysis for the leukemia study and thyroid cancer study in Chernobyl clean-up workers; tissue archiving; evaluation of human factor uncertainties; and field work and collection of blood and other biological samples and dosimetry for the TRIO study.</p>\r\n<p>The projects are performed by the Partner organizations (IEM and RCRM) and the administration and support tasks are handled by the Contractor.

This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261201600298P held by the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU).</p>\r\n<p>The Chernobyl Research Unit (CRU), DCEG REB sponsors joint U.S.-Ukraine studies of health effects of the Chernobyl Accident.  Currently, there are two partnership agreements supporting three collaborative U.S.-Ukraine epidemiological projects in Ukraine.  These projects are 1) \"Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (P004) undertaken at the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism (IEM), Kiev; 2) \"Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases Among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (P003) at the Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM), Kiev; and 3) \"Thyroid Cancer among Chernobyl Cleanup Workers in Ukraine\" (P003A) undertaken as a variation of the project name, \"Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases Among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (see below) also at RCRM.</p>\r\n<p>The partnership agreement for \"Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (P004) involves thyroid screening and other related tasks in a cohort of about 13,000 people who were exposed to post-Chernobyl radioactive fallout under age 20 years. The aim of this project is to assess early and late morphologic and functional changes in the thyroid glands of persons exposed at young ages to radiation from radioactive materials released as a consequence of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident.  The cohort members have been undergoing diagnostic thyroid examinations since 1998.  Under a rigid protocol approved by NCI, IEM staff carries out the field work to maintain contact with the cohort members and invite them to diagnostic thyroid examinations, which may include palpation, ultrasound scanning, thyroid hormone and other laboratory tests. These examinations are done at IEM or by a mobile team.  If deemed necessary by the protocol, cohort members are referred to an expert endocrinologist at IEM for a fine-needle aspiration biopsy for diagnostic confirmation.  Interview information collected by IEM regarding residential, health, diet and lifestyle history has been used for estimating radiation doses by an international expert group involving NCI.  Follow-up is also performed on all subjects for thyroid cancer morbidity and mortality through linkage with the national cancer registry in Ukraine. The IEM is responsible for the tracing of cohort subjects, recording medical and other data, data processing, and database management and organizing analytical data for NCI. IEM collects fresh and/or archived samples for study by NCI genetic and genomic investigations.  IEM also provides data management and quality control, services needed for radiation dose reconstruction to be undertaken by NCI and other dosimetry experts and assist data analysis and manuscript preparations for NCI.</p>\r\n<p>The partnership project agreement for \"Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident\" (P003) involves a case-control study of leukemia among clean-up workers carried out by RCRM staff.  The objective of this study is to assess the risk of leukemia and other hematological cancers related to radiation exposure that the clean-up workers received during the recovery and clean-up operations after the accident.  Data collection undertaken by RCRM is nearly completed, and major study results showing a significant risk of leukemia associated with radiation exposure have been published.  The RCRM continues to provide additional data and/or biological samples for analyses performed by NCI.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, an amendment has been made to the above agreement with RCRM to add a case-control study of thyroid cancer in the same clean-up worker population, \"Thyroid Cancer among Chernobyl Cleanup Workers in Ukraine\" (P003A).  Under the protocol approved by NCI, RCRM staff conducts field work to identify cases with thyroid cancer and non-cancer controls, interview them for radiation exposure information, and collect saliva samples for future genetic studies.  In addition, under the protocol approved by NCI, RCRM acquire and store archival thyroid tumor tissues and other biological samples for NCI genetic research (\"Tissue Archiving\").  The RCRM also provides data management and quality control, services needed for radiation dose reconstruction to be undertaken by NCI and other dosimetry experts and assist data analysis and manuscript preparations for NCI.</p>\r\n<p>In all three projects, NCI is responsible for study design and methodologies while the Contractor shall implement an un-interrupted continuation of these projects under a Partner Project Agreement, providing technical and financial management for the projects in Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>As set forth in the agreement signed by the United States, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine, funds received by the Recipients (RCRM and IEM) in Ukraine from the NCI, in connection with the contractors projects, shall be excluded in determining the profits of the contractor for the purpose of tax liability and funds received by persons shall not be included in these persons taxable incomes.  The allocation of intellectual property arising from the agreement and the responsibilities for protecting and exploiting such intellectual property have been negotiated between the Recipient and the Partner.  Exploitation of results shall be limited to applications for peaceful purposes, and the Recipient and the NCI shall ensure that any results that could result in concerns over proliferations of weapons technology and transfer of sensitive technologies will be protected in accordance with Ukrainian laws and international agreements.</p>\r\n<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF PROCUREMENT<br />The objective of this procurement is to obtain severable support services to provide technical and financial management oversight for the four NCI supported projects in Ukraine: (1) follow-up for thyroid cancer and related activities projects/activities (including genomic and in utero studies) in individuals exposed to radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident; and (2) leukemia and other hematologic diseases among clean-up workers in Ukraine following the Chernobyl accident and related studies and activities, including data collection and analysis for the leukemia study and thyroid cancer study in Chernobyl clean-up workers; tissue archiving; evaluation of human factor uncertainties; and field work and collection of blood and other biological samples and dosimetry for the TRIO study.</p>\r\n<p>The projects are performed by the Partner organizations (IEM and RCRM) and the administration and support tasks are handled by the Contractor.

The Government will evaluate the technical and price factors listed below to make its award decision:</p>\r\n<p>TECHNICAL FACTORS</p>\r\n<p>The technical evaluation will be based on the technical factors below. All technical factors are equal in value.</p>\r\n<p>1)\tPast Performance</p>\r\n<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past experiences in lease services to determine whether the provided project reference(s) are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the requirements in this solicitation, and to determine the probability of an Offeror's successful performance of the contract. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance on related contracts to assess the Offeror's rate of successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, effective management of subcontractors, cost management, level of communication between the contracting parties, proactive management, customer satisfaction, and experience working with other federal clients.</p>\r\n<p>The Government reserves the right to assess the past performance of proposed subcontractors.</p>\r\n<p>The Government will rely on its discretion to determine the sources of past performance information used in the evaluation, and the information may be obtained from references provided by the Offeror, the agency's knowledge of contractor performance, other government agencies or commercial entities, or past performance databases.</p>\r\n<p>If an Offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the Offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating. However, because experience is essential to the successful performance and outcome of this contract, the Government's confidence in the probability of successful performance by an Offeror without a history of relevant past performance is very low; therefore, the Government is unlikely to make an award to such an Offeror.</p>\r\n<p>2)\tQualifications of Proposed Personnel</p>\r\n<p>The Government will review the resumes or information provided for proposed key personnel to evaluate each individual's experience and ability to perform the Government's requirements. The education, experience, and accomplishments of proposed key personnel will be evaluated to determine the degree to which they possess the qualifications to perform their proposed duties under the contract. All information provided in the resume is subject to evaluation.</p>\r\n<p>3)\tTechnical Approach and Capability</p>\r\n<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed technical approach and capabilities necessary to perform the contract requirements to assess whether the Offeror can perform all contract requirements. Of interest to the Government is the Offeror's knowledge and understanding of the General Services Administration's (GSA) and the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) lease assessment and evaluation practices. Of particular interest to the Government is the Offeror's capability and expertise in leasing broadcasting facilities. Lease assessment and evaluation practices of are beneficial. Additionally, expertise specifically with broadcasting facilities is also beneficial.</p>\r\n<p>All information provided in the technical capability section is subject to evaluation.</p>\r\n<p>4)\tAlternative Technical Arrangements</p>\r\n<p>The Government will evaluate any alternative and creative methods of meeting the Government's defined technical requirements and whether the alternative method is beneficial to the Government.</p>\r\n<p>PRICE FACTOR<br /> <br />1)\tPrice</p>\r\n<p>The Government will evaluate the information provided in the Price Proposal to determine whether the offered price for Tasks 1 and 2 are fair and reasonable and to determine whether the offered price is commensurate with the Offeror's proposed approach. Lease Credits are more favorable to the Government and shall be evaluated as such. The Government will evaluate each offer to determine the overall benefit to the Government and the Offeror's ability to adequately meet or exceed the Government's cost objectives. The Government reserves to right to award a contract to other than the lowest evaluated price. Proposed costs must be entirely compatible with the Technical Proposal. Options, if any are included, will be evaluated in accordance with 52.217-5.</p>\r\n<p>RELEVANT IMPORTANCE OF ALL EVALUATION FACTORS</p>\r\n<p>All evaluation factors other than price, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>\r\n<p>a)\t52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)</p>\r\n<p>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>\r\n<p>(End of Provision)</p>\r\n<p>b)\tA written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>\r\n<p>(End of provision)<br />C.\tAward Determination</p>\r\n<p>The Government will award a contract to the Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation requirements; who is determined responsible in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.1 by possessing the financial resources and other capabilities necessary to fulfill the requirements of the contract; and whose proposal is judged, by an integrated assessment of price/cost and non-price evaluation factors, to provide the best value to the Government in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation.</p>\r\n<p>The Government anticipates awarding a single contract for the performance of Task 1. The Government reserves the right to award the tasks to different Contractors, or to decide not to award the tasks described in this solicitation.  <br />&emsp;<br />III.\tFAR SOLICITATION PROVISIONS &amp; CLAUSES</p>\r\n<p>A.\tFAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 98)</p>\r\n<p>This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

Step-1 proposals are due October 19, 2018 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time.\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>SSERVI CAN-3 NNH18ZDA018C solicits the submission of multi-institutional team-based proposals for research as participating members of the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI). Proposals must clearly articulate an innovative research program addressing basic and/or applied research fundamental to understanding the nature of the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, and the near space environments of these bodies, to enable eventual human exploration of these destinations.</p>\r\n<p>The proposed research should address NASA's basic (science) and applied (exploration) research goals and should include multidisciplinary investigations that address the objectives of this CAN. The proposed research should be integrated; thus, proposals consisting of tasks addressing multifaceted questions must demonstrate significant scientific and/or technical connections among the tasks. Proposals that only address a single question should strive to integrate interdisciplinary expertise and methodologies. It is expected that teams bring together expertise from more than a single institution.</p>\r\n<p>This CAN supports the broad spectrum of lunar, NEA, and Martian moon studies encompassing investigations of the surface, interior, exosphere, genesis, evolution, and the near-space environments of these bodies. Investigations that link science and exploration are highly encouraged. Fundamental research having clear, critical and longer-term implications for acquiring or interpreting data regarding potential human destinations is encouraged (for example, addressing Target Body Strategic Knowledge Gaps), as are research efforts that are relevant to (but are not dependent upon) current or future space missions. Proposals in the areas of astrophysics and heliophysics that are enabled through human and robotic exploration of the Target Bodies are also solicited through this Cooperative Agreement Notice.</p>\r\n<p>Efforts to develop new technological approaches to scientific exploration of Target Body(s) are encouraged, including but not limited to telerobotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. Supported investigations include, but are not limited to, theoretical investigations, numerical modeling of physical or chemical processes, experimental/laboratory investigations, development of technical/technological approaches, and field studies.</p>\r\n<p>Proposal review, selection, and award will be implemented according to the guidelines set forth in Sections 5.0 and 6.0 of this funding announcement. While SSERVI will continue to support research addressing potential human exploration destinations, given 1) the Administration's focus on returning to the Moon and 2) opportunities to be provided by the commercial lunar industry, proposals that address these near-term lunar needs and opportunities will be given preference. Proposed research that complements current CAN-2 Institute Teams, and/or addresses important research areas not currently covered in the Institute, will be given strong consideration (see: <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http://sservi.nasa.gov/sserviteams/</span></strong>).</p>\r\n<p>Section 4.0 Proposal and Submission Information provides important information regarding restrictions and deadlines for Principal Investigator and other key personnel changes and other key dates:<br />&bull;\tA mandatory \"Step-1 proposal\" is due 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time October 19, 2018.

The TA should design and recommend the integration of smart grid technologies into the Ivorian electricity grid by analyzing the losses in the Ivoirian electricity system and developing a loss reduction strategy, implementation plan, and monitoring and evaluation plan to help meet C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire's energy growth and renewable energy goals.</p>\r\n<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND AND GRANTEE</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is providing a grant in the amount of US$763,780 to the Minist&egrave;re de l'Economie et des Finances, acting through the Minist&egrave;re du P&eacute;trole, de l'&Eacute;nergie et des &Eacute;nergies Renouvelables and C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire &Eacute;nergies (together, the \"Grantee\") in accordance with a grant agreement dated August 2018, (\"Grant Agreement\"). These funds shall be used for the cost of goods and services to provide technical assistance (\"TA\") to support the improvement of the electricity grid (\"Project\") in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. The Grantee is soliciting technical proposals from qualified U.S. firms to provide expert consulting services to perform the TA.</p>\r\n<p>C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire is the economic leader of the WAEMU (West African Economic and Monetary Union) zone. The country aims to become an emerging country by 2020 thanks to a strong economic growth, based on the development of all sectors of the economy. The goal is to improve, ultimately, the quality of life by adopting measures and reforms that help accelerate people's access to basic goods and services.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire developed four energy sector master plans to identify priority investments in generation, transmission, distribution, dispatching, monitoring, and management of the electricity grid for the period 2014-2030. The goal of the Grantee and of the energy sector master plans is to provide abundant, high-quality and least-cost electricity to satisfy an ever-increasing demand. CI-Energies is a parastatal with the responsibility of planning for the development of the energy sector in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. CI-Energies and the Compagnie Ivoirienne d'&Eacute;lectricit&eacute; (\"CIE\") are seeking the best solutions to reduce losses in the power system of C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. The TA will recommend loss reduction solutions to the Ministry of Energy and CI-Energies to improve the technical and commercial performance of the Ivorian electricity sector.</p>\r\n<p>As part of its mission, CI-ENERGIES, conducts planning studies for the development of the power system. In that capacity, CI-ENERGIES carries out the technical, economic and financial feasibility studies of the projects identified in the master plans, or at the request of third parties, particularly for the integration of production facilities, medium and large power industrial complexes. In addition, CIE, concessionaire of the public electricity service, are seeking the best solutions that can reduce power losses.</p>\r\n<p>The overall grid output is an indicator that allows for improvements to the efficiency of the electricity system. Declines in output causes additional costs of production and lowers returns. In C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, this indicator was highest in 1997, with an overall output of 87.43 percent.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2002, the output has been relatively low, reaching 71.25% in 2011. Investments in development and restructuring the transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as actions taken against electricity theft, have allowed improvements to grid output, with 77.07% in 2013, 78.59% in 2014, 78.78% in 2015, and 80.30% in 2016. However, the grid output at the end of December 2017 had declined by 0.1% compared to December 2016, falling to 80.20%. This decline is mainly the result of an increase in transmission losses due to congestion on the transmission grid.</p>\r\n<p>Work is underway in the different segments of the Ivorian electricity system to continue the improvement efforts to achieve overall efficiency values of over 87 percent by 2020.<br />The results of the loss reduction study must provide solutions to the Grantee to improve technical and commercial performance of the Ivorian electricity sector.<br />The Contractor's team shall include, at a minimum a: Project Leader/Manager; Electrical Engineer/Power Systems Analyst; Electrical Technician; Electricity Distribution and Metering Expert; Automation, Telecontrol and Telecommunication Expert; Power Generation Expert; and an Economist.</p>\r\n<p>All deliverables shall be delivered in both English and French.

Completed Price Summary Chart (Attachment 2) in Excel.<br />b. Fixed hourly rates shall be fully burdened and include all costs (direct and indirect), overhead, and profit and such rates shall be provided for both on-site and off-site rates.<br />If applicable, Contractor Teaming or Prime Contractor/Subcontractor Arrangement Supporting Documentation.

The following goals are applicable to this procurement and should be utilized for developing a subcontracting plan in response to this RFP.</p>\r\n<p>Small Business (SB) 23%<br />Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) 5%<br />Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) 3%<br />Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) 5%<br />HUBZone Small Business (HUBZone) 3%</p>\r\n<p>If the Offeror is exempt from the Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the response in this Tab E shall indicate that is the case.</p>\r\n<p>*Note: Offerors that are required to submit a plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 will not be eligible for award if they fail to submit an acceptable Subcontracting Plan. If the apparently successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award.</p>\r\n<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation of offers shall consist of a two phase approach. Offerors found to be at least acceptable in Evaluation Phase I will be given an opportunity to provide an oral presentation, which will be evaluated as part of the overall offer.</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria outlined in this section.<br />A single award will be made to the responsible Offeror submitting an overall proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal meets the Government's requirements and whose technical proposal and price represent the best value to the Government. The evaluation of proposals will be based on the following factors:</p>\r\n<p>(a) Technical Approach<br />(b) Management/Personnel Approach<br />(c) Past Performance <br />(d) Oral Presentation <br />(e) Price (non-rated)</p>\r\n<p>Factor 1: Technical Approach</p>\r\n<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed technical approach in determining the Offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements described in the Statement of Work.</p>\r\n<p>Factor 2: Management Approach</p>\r\n<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's management approach and the extent to which the Offeror has the organizational resources to successfully perform the requirements described in the Statement of Work.</p>\r\n<p>Factor 3: Past Performance. The SEC will assess the Offeror's performance record, and record of integrity and business ethics for work that is similar and/or relevant to the requirements of the SOW.</p>\r\n<p>Factor 4: Oral Presentation. The Government will evaluate the degree to which the Offeror effectively demonstrates the ability to successfully engage with senior executives and subject matter experts to perform the requirements of the Statement of Work.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Approach is more important than Management/Personnel which is more important than Past Performance. Past Performance is more important than the Oral Presentation. When combined, the technical evaluation factors of (a) Technical/Management Approach, (b) Personnel, (c) Past Performance, and (d) Oral Presentation are significantly more important than (e) Price. As the technical proposals become more equal, price becomes more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e., are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced proposal. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced proposal if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>\r\n<p>Awards may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions. Offerors are, therefore, cautioned that each initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms. The failure of an Offeror to meet any given requirement of the RFP in their proposal may result in the entire proposal being found unacceptable and eliminated from the competition.</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation Factors:<br /><br />(a) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>\r\n<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of any offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>\r\n<p>x. The offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certification - Commercial Items (Aug 2018) with its offeror. The offeror shall complete only paragraph b of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) website located at https://www.sam.gov/portal. If the Offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, the Offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (u) of this provision.</p>\r\n<p>xi.

Vietnam has worked to increase power generation and transmission capacity as load demand increases, however, power loss along the long transmission lines and the risk of power shortages continue to increase.  Further, because power transmission and generation capacity have not increased at the same rate as power load demand, both power transmission and generation resources continue to operate at capacity.  As a result, sudden increases in power demand, such as those due to weather-related events, can lead to brownouts or blackouts involving significant loss of load.  In addition, the Government of Vietnam is preparing for the increased penetration of renewable energy to the grid from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 10 percent by 2030.  While adding renewable energy sources helps to diversify generation capacity, intermittent energy sources like solar and wind create challenges for grid stability and management of the grid network.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The TA will evaluate technical issues of the Vietnamese power system including grid stability, adding large amounts of Renewable energy sources, need for ancillary services, etc. These specific technical issues shall be studied in detail, with the intent of identifying energy storage (including both BESS and Pumped storage, flywheels, hybrid arrangement) or an advanced grid support power equipment-based solution (FACTS), and HVDC alternatives.  The selected U.S. firm will evaluate grid-scale energy storage totaling 200 megawatts (MW) to be implemented in a number of areas throughout Vietnam over a five-year period.  The selected U.S. firm will also develop an implementation plan for the National Load Dispatch Center (\"NLDC\").  NLDC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVN responsible for load dispatch throughout Vietnam and will be managing this study and ultimately implementing this project if it is determined feasible.

This program is an FHWA sponsored program that determines the impact of connected vehicle technologies, via three real-world deployments of CV Technology. The Secure Data Commons (SDC) is the tool that will be used to ingest, house, evaluate, and make determinations of the impacts of these deployments. Now that the SDC Platform has been built and is operational, there is an immediate need for evaluator support within the platform to ingest additional CV Pilot datasets into the environment, to format and prepare the data for analysis, and to support the evaluation team in their analysis. To support this undertaking, the Volpe Center requires immediate access to supplemental contractor programmer staff in the update of the Secure Data Commons Platform.</p>\r\n<p>STATEMENT OF WORK - Begin</p>\r\n<p>BACKGROUND</p>\r\n<p>The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has supported the ITS Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) in developing a secure, cloud-based analytics platform to store and analyze data from the Connected Vehicle (CV) Pilot program. The goal of the connected vehicle pilot program is to understand the impacts of connected vehicle technologies. Pilot deployments are being launched in three communities across the country; New York City, Tampa, FL, and Wyoming. The CV Pilot program has two evaluator teams who will be assessing the impacts of these deployments. Texas Transportation Institute will be assessing the mobility and national-level impacts, while a team at Volpe will be assessing the safety impacts.</p>\r\n<p>Volpe has also been tasked with developing the environment where the data for the entire program will be stored and analyzed. This platform (formerly called the Connected Vehicle Pilot Evaluation Platform) has been merged with a pre-existing ITS JPO system called the Secure Data Commons (SDC). The original CV Pilot Evaluation Platform development team from Volpe is now working in partnership with the SDC Development team to develop all aspects of the SDC that are specific to the CV Pilot program. The Volpe Center is seeking contractual support to continue the development of the SDC platform, expand the CV capabilities of the SDC, and to provide targeted evaluator support to the Volpe safety evaluation team.</p>\r\n<p>TASKS</p>\r\n<p>Analyst/Programmer Support</p>\r\n<p>The CV Pilot portion of the SDC platform needs continual development by a programmer well versed in the SDC system architecture, and the Volpe Safety evaluation team needs programming support from someone who understands how to develop within the SDC environment and has experience processing and analyzing CV data. To undertake these updates, the Volpe Center requires immediate access to supplemental contractor analyst/programmer staff in the CV Pilot evaluation platform development.</p>\r\n<p>Any associated travel will be included in the firm fixed price task.</p>\r\n<p>TASK 1: Connected Vehicle Pilot Support</p>\r\n<p>Task 1A: Ingest additional CV datasets into the SDC</p>\r\n<p>Ingest additional datasets from the CV Pilots (WYDOT, THEA, NYC) as they become available. For each dataset, there should be a clearly mapped out process of loading the data into the data lake and where appropriate, transforming the data and loading it into the data warehouse.

As a result, several Brazilian states are seeking alternative resources and new technological approaches to maintain water supply, such as water reuse technologies. A key example is the Aquapolo water reuse plant in Sao Paulo, which is owned by the Sao Paulo state water utility SABESP. This plant is the largest plant in South America and the fifth largest in the world, and supplies reused water to industrial customers, in lieu of more scarce drinking water or well water. In the neighboring state of Parana, the state water utility SANEPAR, is facing similar challenges, along with increased demand from its industrial customers, who want a sustainable and reliable source of water for various operations, such as cooling, refrigeration, and cleaning.</p>\r\n<p>Acquiring water reuse technologies is a high priority for SANEPAR. The company has mapped current and future demand/consumers, conducted site visits abroad (including to the United States), and developed an initial water reuse plant project concept. SANEPAR has requested USTDA funding for a long-term approach that would initially include a water recycling facility that would utilize a combination of wastewater plus water as feedstock, and a second water recycling plant that would draw primarily from the company's urban wastewater collection infrastructure. The feasibility study would identify initial plant requirements, best suited technologies, provide initial designs, and assess the best rate structure for produced water.<br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$616,951 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>\r\n<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209.

Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.

The country's generation mix is mostly comprised of<br />large hydro plants and requires long-distance transmission lines to power the country's cities.<br />The electricity transmission sector has increasingly gained importance and the country's federal<br />regulator (ANEEL) now requires that generation projects secure access to transmission lines<br />prior to signing up for electricity auctions in the country, thereby placing new burdens on<br />transmission companies, and increasing the need for them to improve efficiency.</p>\r\n<p>ISA CTEEP is an electricity transmission company based in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo and is<br />responsible for transmitting approximately 24 percent of the electricity produced in Brazil and 60<br />percent of the electricity consumed in the country's southeast region. The company is expanding<br />rapidly and is taking important steps to modernize its transmission assets, mostly acquired<br />from former state-owned companies in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo. ISA CTEEP has invested over<br />$3 .7 billion in these operations since 2008.</p>\r\n<p>ISA CTEEP sees benefits of deploying grid-wide automation technologies with interoperable<br />protocols, as well as self-correcting and remote-controlled capabilities for its operations. As<br />such, ISA CTEEP requested USTDA technical assistance to develop technical requirements,<br />cybersecurity standards, a roadmap and an implementation plan for a series of upgrades to its<br />substations.</p>\r\n<p>ISA CTEEP currently owns and operates 126 substations and over 18,642 kilometers of<br />transmission lines across the country. Meanwhile, the company continues to grow and expand its<br />coverage. As recently as June 2018, ISA CTEEP won a bid to operate additional transmission<br />lines in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>\r\n<p>Although the company has recently invested in new and modern solutions, these have been<br />installed through small pilots and not in an interoperable fashion, thus hindering the company's<br />ability to fully integrate systems, remotely monitor substation activity, and reduce costly<br />maintenance and inspection dispatches. This technical assistance would provide<br />recommendations not only for existing substations, but also for substations acquired in the<br />future, or for greenfield projects, as the company continues to expand its coverage area. ISA<br />CTEEP's goal is to deploy the recommended technologies, solutions and protocols for substation<br />protection, control, and monitoring across its country-wide operations in the near-to-medium<br />term.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$488,360 grant to the Grantee from<br />the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>\r\n<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the<br />Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are<br />available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209.

The increasing adoption of digital and remotely controlled systems has improved efficiencies in the electricity sector in Brazil, but it has also elevated concerns about the sector's resiliency and ability to withstand cybersecurity threats. With the exception of the State of Roraima, Brazil has an interconnected, inter-state transmission grid. Brazil currently has an installed generation capacity of 137 GW and over one thousand transmission substations, resulting in a considerable number of sites in need of cybersecurity protection.</p>\r\n<p>Companhia Paranaense de Energia (\"Copel\") is the electricity and generation company for the State of Paran&aacute; and has become a national standard for operations automation. Copel has implemented solutions for remote access to substation supervision, as well as other mission critical solutions for its operations. Copel has 38 transmission substations and 21 generation stations and is critical for the energy security of the State of Parana.</p>\r\n<p>Copel seeks Technical Assistance for three main reasons. First, Copel would like to help identify vulnerabilities related to its operational systems, including gaps in its security protocols, processes, regulations, and technologies. It would also help develop an implementation plan for the installation and upgrade of cybersecurity solutions, protocols and procedures, using the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan (CIP) as a reference. The adoption of NERC CIP-based standards would better position U.S. vendors for future procurements.</p>\r\n<p>Second, this technical assistance would develop the specifications and requirements for a follow&shy;on pilot to be implemented directly by Copel, immediately following the conclusion of the technical assistance. The technical assistance would not include the pilot but would provide Copel with the necessary technical analyses to move forward with the pilot. Third, Copel is committed to using the recommendations of the technical assistance to promote and advocate for new cybersecurity regulations in the country. As one of the first major utility-scale cybersecurity projects in the country, this activity is anticipated to be a catalyst for future projects and serve as a model for future standards and regulations.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$601,455 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>\r\n<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209.

The Contractor will support the Grantee as it prepares tenders for complex, high-value infrastructure projects in the transportation sector. The Contractor's support should help the Grantee establish sound, quality-based, transparent procurement practices that contribute to the sustainability of infrastructure investments, support economic growth, and foster greater international competition.</div>\r\n<div><br />BRIEF PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE\r\n<p>About the Global Procurement Initiative</p>\r\n<p>USTDA and the Government of the Philippines (GoP) established a partnership under USTDA's Global Procurement Initiative: Understanding Best Value (GPI) in 2015. The GPI is dedicated to assisting public officials in emerging economies to better understand the total cost of ownership of goods and services for infrastructure projects.</p>\r\n<p>The GPI helps public procurement officials establish practices and policies that integrate life-cycle cost analysis and best-value determination in a fair, transparent manner. Adopting these standards improves governments' capacity to make better-informed decisions that take into account all relevant costs of goods and services over their entire life cycle. This leads to smarter, longer-term investments with overall savings to the government, and also levels the playing field for international tenders.</p>\r\n<p>Project Background and Description</p>\r\n<p>In 2016, the GoP announced massive infrastructure investment through 2022.  DOTr has received one of the largest budget allocations of the GoP departments, an acknowledgement of the critical need to address transportation infrastructure development and reinvestment.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the direction of the GoP administration, the DOTr has launched numerous aviation sector projects.  These infrastructure projects seek to expand transport linkages and efficiency and improve airport connectivity.  Notable projects in airport infrastructure include, for example, the modernizations of Nino Aquino International Airport, the New Bohol (Panglao) Airport, Languindingan Airport, Davao Airport, Bacolod Airport, Iloilo Airport, Clark International Airport, and the General Santos International Airport Development.</p>\r\n<p>The key factor is to ensure that these procurements are conducted in line with international best practices and with the use of life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), to avoid risking poor project outcomes and low international competition. This assistance will not extend to the evaluation or award of tenders.</p>\r\n<p>While the DOTr recognizes the importance of procuring based on best-value criteria, including LCCA, it requests resources to employ these methodologies and build the capacity of its procurement officials.  The DOTr has therefore requested support through the GPI for Advisors to assist in the implementation of its pipeline quickly and effectively, while allowing DOTr to obtain the best project outcomes for public funds.  The Advisors would help the Philippines meet its goals to achieve value for money in publicly-funded transportation projects, while helping to build capacity of internal staff to perform value-based determinations on their own after the Advisors' period of performance concludes.</p>\r\n<p>As further background, together, the GoP and USTDA have already conducted two other activities under their partnership. The Phase I Workshop in Manila trained over 60 Philippine public procurement officials.  The Phase II Orientation Visit brought a group of 20 high level officials to the United States for 12 days, where the delegation observed best practices in value-based procurement at the U.S. federal, state, and local levels. This project seeks to continue GPI engagement with the Philippines by providing targeted procurement advisory assistance to the DOTr to begin implementing the best practices learned through previous GPI Programs on targeted priority infrastructure projects.</p>\r\n<p><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $940,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>\r\n<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and background on previous Philippines GPI activities are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Each project will have a Principal Investigator and the participating graduate student on an awarded project will be a \"Future Investigator\".</p>\r\n<p>The FINESST solicitation and awards will have the following properties:<br />1. Project proposals may request up to a three year period of performance (POP). POP changes, including no cost extensions, will follow normal NASA grant procedures.<br />2. Continuation of FINESST awards beyond the first year will require the submission of a progress report via NSPIRES due on March 15, 2020, at 11:59 PM Eastern Time.  <br />3. FINESST proposal costs will be limited to those allowable under 2 CFR 200.75 - Participant support costs (e.g., stipends) and, in general, NASA does not permit indirect costs to be requested or recovered on Participant support costs.<br />4. The maximum award value per project is $135,000 for a three-year POP with a cap of $45,000 per 12 months.</p>\r\n<p>Proposal review, selection, and award will be implemented according to the guidelines set forth in the FINESST Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). In the future, rather than continue FINESST as a separate BAA, SMD expects to integrate this graduate opportunity as a cross-divisional appendix to SMD's omnibus research solicitation, \"Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES)\".

The first web app, VAOS, enables Veterans to directly schedule an appointment or submit a request to VA scheduling staff members to make an appointment. Features include not only booking appointments into VA primary and specialty care clinic openings, but also VA telehealth appointments and telehealth session support.  Additionally, VAOS is the app Veterans use to check eligibility for community care treatment, search for community providers, and request community care appointments.  VA staff members use the second web app, Scheduling Manager (SM), to process the requests for appointments from Veterans using VAOS.  The third application is the VA Tool Set, (VATS), which is a small staff-facing only application used to configure VAOS at VA Medical Centers and Health Care Systems.  The Government requires Agile development and maintenance support including project management, application lifecycle management, and production troubleshooting and adaptive, preventive, perfective, and corrective maintenance for the VAOS Suite of web applications: VAOS, SM, and VATS apps and related Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) patches supporting both the VA caregiver community and the external Veteran community.
