Runway Status Lights processes this data using complex software algorithms with adjustable parameters to control airfield lights in accordance with Air Traffic operations, including anticipated separation. Red airfield lights (Runway Entrance Lights and Takeoff Hold Lights) illuminate and extinguish as vehicles and aircraft traverse the airfield.\nSystem:  Runway Status Lights integrates airport lighting equipment with approach and surface surveillance systems to provide a visual signal to pilots and vehicle operators indicating that it is unsafe to enter/cross or begin takeoff on runway. The system is fully automated based on inputs from surface and terminal surveillance systems. Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway.\n\nThe principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), with a size standard of $38.5M.\n\nThe current qualified source(s) are ADB Safegate (CAGE 5ED70) and Saab Sensis (CAGE 6ZQN9).

(TBE). NASA intends to continue the sustaining engineering and integration work for MSRR, MSG,&nbsp;LSG, and ISERV currently provided under the Engineering and Integration Work for Materials Science Research Rack (MSRR), Microgravity Science Research Glovebox (MSG) and International Space Station SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization (ISERV) Pathfinder delivery order NNM14AB60D issued against IDIQ contract NNM13A35C with TBE.</p>\r\n<p>In order to replace MSRR, MSG, LSG, and ISERV work currently being performed under TBE's SDOS contract with a new business entity in this environment will require an estimated $1.1 million in duplicated cost to the Government to bring the new contractor up to speed with the flight hardware being developed, as well as the ground and flight operating hardware. This cost would not be expected to be recovered through competition.</p>\r\n<p>Competition is impractical for the following reasons:</p>\r\n<p>A. TBE designed the MSRR in collaboration with NASA. They also developed, built and delivered significant components of the MSRR. The knowledge base constructed by TBE during the design and build phase and over he years of sustaining engineering under both the Syste3ms Development and Operations Support (SDOS/NAS8-02060) and ESP delivery order cannot be quickly replicated elsewhere. TBE has managed and conducted all activities related to the manufacture, assembly, verification, and test for the MSRR project. This has encompassed the development, fabrication, assembly, verification, and test activities of the various items constituting the MSRR Experiment Carrier (EC) and its direct interfaces.</p>\r\n<p>B. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has worked very closely with the business entity that produced the MSG. &nbsp;The Video Upgrade Equipment (VUE) was an MSG facility upgrade launched on SpaceX-4 in September 2014. The VUE hardware experienced a radiation-induced failure of the solid-state memory drives that was first noticed on August 3, 2016. The MSG VUE is currently being redesigned to reduce the likelihood of this issue reoccurring. MSG hardware is currently operative aboard the ISS and any perturbation in project flow will directly disturb the flow of science coming from the ISS program.</p>\r\n<p>C. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has worked very closely with the business entity that performed all the analytical integration work for the MSRR's MSL. The combination of knowledge between TBE and that business entity gives MSFC full corporate knowledge of the MSRR/MSL.</p>\r\n<p>D. TBE is integral to the development of the hardware, as well as the development of the documentation necessary to install and operate the Life Science Glovebox (LSG). In addition to the duplicative costs that would be incurred, changing to a new contractor could negatively impact the facility's readiness for launch on H-II Transfer Vehicle-7 &nbsp;(HTV-7 )and the time needed to install and activate the rack on-orbit. The presence of LSG on-orbit is greatly needed by the ISS Program to ease the investigation workload on the MSG. It should be noted that at present, LSG can only be launched on an HTV, and HTV launches are very infrequent (on the order of once every 9-12 months). If the HTV-7 launch window is missed, significant time will be lost and additional costs will be incurred.</p>\r\n<p>E. The new MSFC Sample Cartridge Development (SCA) design has been developed using a TBE design from a previous project. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has manufactured and integrated the thermal probe SCAs that are used for thermal development testing as well as other hardware to be used during the flight SCA development and qualification campaigns. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has manufactured many of the parts that make up the SCAs and has procured long-lead items that are required for the SCA project to remain on schedule.</p>\r\n<p>F. TBE, under ESP and SDOS and in collaboration with MSFC, designed, built, tested, delivered, and supported the operation of of ISERV. ISERV was launched on HTV-3 in July 2012 and was removed from the Window Observational Research Facility&nbsp;(WORF) in December 2014 after experiencing an on-orbit anomaly.&nbsp; Currently the&nbsp; feasibility of using the ISERV hardware is being assessed. &nbsp;ISERV flight and ground software are unique applications that are critical for successful operations of the ISERV Pathfinder. As the sole developer of this software and with the in-depth knowledge of the ISERV instrument, TBE possesses the critical experience necessary to refurbish or upgrade ISERV.</p>\r\n<p>G. Only TBE has the required skill set to allow the current sustaining engineering and integration work to continue on schedule.

Runway Status Lights processes this data using complex software algorithms with adjustable parameters to control airfield lights in accordance with Air Traffic operations, including anticipated separation. Red airfield lights (Runway Entrance Lights and Takeoff Hold Lights) illuminate and extinguish as vehicles and aircraft traverse the airfield.\nSystem:  Runway Status Lights integrates airport lighting equipment with approach and surface surveillance systems to provide a visual signal to pilots and vehicle operators indicating that it is unsafe to enter/cross or begin takeoff on runway. The system is fully automated based on inputs from surface and terminal surveillance systems. Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway.\n\nThe principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), with a size standard of $38.5M.\n\nThe current qualified source(s) are ADB Safegate (CAGE 5ED70) and Saab Sensis (CAGE 6ZQN9). The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources.

Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.\n\nThis announcement seeks out to improve the overall integrity of the Department of the Navy’s fuel tanks, reduce maintenance and all associated costs, and decreases the out of service periods for the Department of the Navy’s fuel infrastructure.\n This effort will design and develop a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) that can provide both inspection and cleaning capabilities for a wide-range of fuel based storage tanks. The capability to provide intrinsically safe, real-time remote monitoring would significantly reduce labor and out-of-service costs and vulnerability, and increase available bulk fuel storage capacity. In pursuit of these goals, the Department of the Navy seeks innovations with potential for use at multiple locations that improve tank in sections, as described in the topic below.\n\nThe integrity of the Navy’s fuel storage infrastructure is of paramount importance to ensure mission readiness and avoid environmental consequences.\n  Sustainment, Restoration and Maintenance (SRM) costs are heavy. The Navy currently possesses a wide-range of small fuel based storage tanks, 101 of which are identified as Steel Tank Institute (STI) fabricated tanks subject to the API internal/out-of-service inspection cycle.  There are many costs and risks associated with taking a tank out of service for inspection, including fuel removal and storage, manual cleaning, and downtime.  The hazards associated with the cleaning, entry, inspection, testing, maintenance or other aspects are significant. Safety considerations and controls have to be established prior to undertaking these activities associated with tanks.  Due to the complexities of construction contracting, the contracting effort for an internal Clean  and  Inspect (CI) project starts at least a year in advance.\n When ready, fuel is transferred from one tank to another for storage. The tank is then opened and ventilated until such time that it is safe for the entry of a cleaning team.  Out of service time can have a significant effect on mission readiness and strategic application due to the negative effect on petroleum reserves and availability.  An average CI project renders a tank out of service for two years. These costs and risks can be significantly mitigated by using and developing robotic inspection technologies to automate the process and deliver real time data on tank condition without taking a tank out of service.  DoD financial imperatives dictate identifying and employing as many efficiencies as possible.\n\nThe technologies or methodology shall address the following topic area.\n\nNEED TOPIC NO 1: STI Internal Inspections (WET-SIDE)\n\nRDTE of technologies to design and produce a small ROV that would be used to inspect and clean the inside of small fuel storage tanks (i.e.\n STI tanks).  Examples of ROV capabilities could include:\n\n•\tOperational control box system that includes:\no\tProcessing software and operating system for the ROV\no\tUser or operator interface to control the ROV\n•\tNDT Ultra-Sonic Array to take metal thickness readings on the bottom of the tank\n•\tColor camera to navigate and provide visual inspection capabilities\n•\tAPI and ATEX certified safe power umbilical (tether) that connects the ROV from the wet-side to the control box system on the outside/dry-side of the tank\n•\tPlug-and-play cleaning system to negate the need for human entry\n•\tSonar system to enhance navigation and provide additional acoustic inspection capabilities\n\nNEED TOPIC NO 1  Data Collection and Reporting\n\nThe data obtained should be used to support the Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG)( http://www.wbdg.org) POL specifications and criteria including, but not be limited to:\n\nUnified Facilities Criteria:\nUFC 3-460-03 \tOperation and Maintenance: Maintenance of Petroleum Fuel Systems\n\nUnified Facilities Guide Specifications:\nUFGS 33 08 55\tCommissioning of Fuel Facility Systems\nUFGS 33 56 10\tFactory-Fabricated Fuel Storage Tanks\nUFGS 33 56 13\tSteel Tanks With Fixed Roofs\nUFGS 33 58 00\tLeak Detection for Fueling System\nUFGS 33 59 00\tTightness Testing of Existing Underground Fuel Systems\nUFGS 33 65 00\tCleaning Petroleum Storage Tanks\nUFGS 09 97 13.17\tThree Coat Epoxy Interior Coating of Welded Steel Petroleum Fuel Tanks\nUFGS 09 97 23.13\tInterior Lining For Concrete Storage Tanks\n\nABSTRACT SUBMITTALS TO THIS BAA CAN BE MADE USING THE ABSTRACT FORM.\n Submissions should be made via the NAVFAC EXWC BAA e-mail: maria.z.smith@navy.mil.\n\nSubmission process: This announcement is for abstracts/white papers only. Abstracts shall identify the specific topic area that the submission addresses. Each abstract must be specific to the topic area. Multiple submissions are acceptable. Abstracts will be evaluated on the stated criteria. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and lists of relevant publications.\n\nThe abstracts will be evaluated by a Government Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to select technologies and methodologies that have potential benefits to the Navy. The abstracts will not be evaluated against each other since each possesses a unique technology with no common work statement.\n When an abstract aligns with a customer need and funding, the NAVFAC contracting office may request a full proposal.  Additional guidance will be provided at that time, regarding cost and pricing submittals in addition to a more comprehensive technical submission.\n\nTechnical Evaluation: Unsuccessful abstracts will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for abstract rejection. Unsuccessful full proposals will receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR part 15. Awards will be in the form of contracts. Average contract duration is one (1) to three (3) years. The government may choose to fund a base period with options.\n\nThe abstracts will be evaluated based on the following CRITERIA, of approximately equal weight.\n\n1).\n TECHNICAL APPROACH: Describe the scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract, in terms of Naval relevance. All proposals must demonstrate an approach that will achieve a DOD technology readiness level (TRL) of 6/7 as the end state, and successfully manage risk while achieving technological advance. Provide an explicit, detailed description of the approach.  If options are required describe appropriate research activities and milestones for subsequent options. The abstract should indicate what tasks are planned, how and where the work will be conducted, a schedule of major events, and the final product(s) to be delivered.\nOfferor’s effort should demonstrate the approach to prove the technical feasibility of the concept, including the risk reduction strategies.\n  The planned methods to achieve each objective or task should be discussed in detail.  This section should be a substantial portion of the abstract.\n\n2). PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR’S and KEY MEMBER’S RELATED EXPERIENCE: The\nqualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract.\n\n3). SAFETY:  NAVFAC requires the offeror to provide their EMR and DART ratings. Safety is an integral and important part of NAVFAC contracting. If the offeror does not have an EMR/DART rating, they should state this and provide the rationale.\n\n4). PAST PERFORMANCE:  The offerors corporate capabilities, related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the offerors proposed objectives.\n  Experience will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence.\n\n5). COST/PRICE: The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach. Describe here a high level estimate of the cost/price, relative to the proposed technical approach. If work in the technical approach is presented in tasks/milestones/technical phases, cost estimates for each are desired.  This can be a single dollar figure for each task/phase at the abstract phase.  At a minimum the offeror shall provide a high level estimated cost, and the narrative basis for this estimate.\n\n6). NAVY BENEFIT AND IMPACT: Expected benefits in terms of reduced total facility ownership cost, projections of the number of Navy sites or facilities where the proposed technology could be deployed, and life cycle cost advantages over current approaches used by Naval facilities.\n\nCRITICAL NOTE: An Offeror is required to be registered with the system for award management (SAM) before any contract award can be made.\n Registration may take up to three weeks.

Fisher, Phone 843-760-3356, Email lisa.fisher@ati.org","DESC":"<p>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this pre-announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP), expected to be released in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">late December 2017</span>. This RPP will focus on the initial phase of acquiring a biofidelic in silico human body model to be used for the predictive modeling of injuries occurring in response to a variety of military hazards. The value of the model lies in its expected capability to accurately predict injury types and severities as well as anatomical locations. Injury predictions will be used in the design of personal protective equipment, platforms (e.g. vehicles, structures), and medical requirements and response planning. This initial phase will be limited to development of a finite element computational model of the human thorax (and potentially abdomen) and experimentation to determine biofidelic tissue constitutive properties. The use-case for the initial phase will be behind armor blunt trauma, as a representative example of biofidelic whole-body modeling of responses to a variety of military hazards.</p>\r\n<p>The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and other DoD research funding organizations by providing cutting-edge technologies and effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, \"nontraditional\" government contractors, academic research institutions, and not-for-profit organizations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Overarching goal of the of the I-PREDICT FNC:</strong> Injury and incapacitation estimates for combat scenarios are currently educated guesses at best. Estimates may be based on simplified injury risk thresholds on hazard parameters such as pressure, stress, strain, or force applied to an organ or tissue. Increasingly, such knowledge is incorporated into computational simulations that can be run repeatedly to explore variations in hazards and physiologic responses in order to assign statistical confidence to predictions of injury risk. Current modeling and simulation methods for predicting injury can be inaccurate, regional rather than whole-body, not validated appropriately, and may not be based upon physiologically or operationally relevant loading conditions. Injury prevention standards are needed to protect Warfighters from injuries based on a scientific understanding of hazardous conditions typical of military service, and of the vulnerability of tissues, organs, and bodily functions to those hazards. Such standards will inform the design tradespaces of personal protective equipment (PPE), safer vehicles, and safe-to-operate weapons systems; as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to protect against injury. Injury prediction models will also allow improved estimation of casualty types, rates, and severity, which in turn will predict individual and unit readiness during operations and medical treatment requirements. The development of a highly biofidelic finite element model of the whole human body is needed to inform such applications.</p>\r\n<p>The overarching goal of the of the I-PREDICT FNC is to provide a TRL 6 in silico \"skin-in\" integrated finite element computational model of the Warfighter's body to be used for injury prevention and treatment, medical response planning, and equipment design including tradeoff analysis among design parameters, validation, and testing. The I-PREDICT FNC will provide an integrated biomechanical response model of the Warfighter using biofidelic constitutive tissue properties, and associated pre- and post-processing tools that will predict injury and near term functional incapacitation (reduction in the ability to move, shoot, and/or communicate) in response to specific military hazards, in priority order of: 1) blunt impact/accelerative loading and 2) blast pressure effects. The model will be based on experimentally derived material properties of human tissues at strain rates equivalent to those experienced during military hazards, and will be validated with data on regional and whole-body mechanics. I-PREDICT will include variable anthropometry (e.g., differences in size, weight, somatotype, and age), variable posture, variable biofidelity, and gender differences in modeling. The resulting injury and readiness estimates will be incorporated into medical response planning and preliminary design and testing of equipment, resulting in cost savings and more thoroughly vetted products that make principled considerations for engineering tradeoffs (e.g., weight of body armor vs. mobility).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Focus of Upcoming RPP:</strong> The initial RPP will solicit experimental and modeling proposals to advance the state of the art in prediction of injury due to behind armor blunt trauma (BABT) of the thorax (and potentially abdomen and lower back), as an initial focused use case representing an operational military need. A previously developed computational model of the torso will be made available to performers as a reference implementation, and as a baseline model subject to improvement. A performer will be expected to adapt the model through parameterization using new or alternatively sourced constitutive response data, validating BABT experiments resulting in kinematic and/or stress/strain data, and/or injury biomechanics data. Time and funding permitting, it is expected that resulting model will be morphable to represent both male and female Warfighters across a range of sizes (5th to 95th percentile body size). Validating experiments of interest should prioritize high-powered antipersonnel rounds to the anterior and/or posterior surfaces of the torso. Any new experiments should provide clear differentiation from prior literature, pointing out specific knowledge gaps and specific improvements to biofidelity of thoracic modeling in a BABT context. In addition to updated constitutive properties, it is expected that the model developer will provide additional updates to the reference implementation to support biofidelity in a high-energy behind armor blunt trauma use case.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Potential for Follow-On Work:</strong> Additional experimentation and modeling may be solicited in future funding years to continue to build an integrated finite element computational model of the entire Warfighter's body to be used for injury prevention and treatment, medical response planning, and equipment design including tradeoff analysis among design parameters, validation, and testing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Funding and Period of Performance:</strong> The U.S. Government (USG) currently has available approximately $850,000 for Fiscal Year (FY) 18. The period of performance is expected to start on March 1, 2018 (subject to change). A near-complete prototype must be ready for delivery to the Government by July 31, 2018. Awardees will have until September 30, 2018 to make final minor improvements to the prototype.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Administrative Comments:</strong> The RPP will be posted to the MTEC website and a notice will be posted FedBiz Opps to notify interested parties. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">MTEC membership is required for the submission of a full proposal in response to this upcoming MTEC RPP</span></strong>.

The SAR DAAC acquires, processes, archives, and distributes SAR data and products needed for NASA Earth science research, as well as the broader science community and educational institutions. These activities are essential to the success of a major NASA program (NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS)&nbsp;Program) and must be performed by an entity with demonstrable abilities and capabilities for developing and operating a science data archive (with annual growth expected to exceed 50 petabyte yearly for future missions) and distribution center; and providing user support for a broad variety of SAR data and products derived from space-borne and airborne platforms. The scientific data is used by a large and diverse range of scientific disciplines and applications including but not limited to oceanography, geology, glaciology, hydrology, ecology, studies of polar processes, ice motion and kinematics, geo-hazards, crustal dynamics research and biomass mapping. There can be no interruption of service after the current contract expires September 30, 2018. According to FAR 6.302-3(b)(2)(ii), the use of the authority at (a)(2)(ii) is appropriate when it is necessary to: Establish or maintain an essential capability for engineering or developmental work calling for the practical application of investigative findings and theories of a scientific or technical nature. The current sets of capabilities possessed by UAF are essential to NASA in that the combination of technological skills, scientific and theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on experience are necessary to operate and manage the SAR DAAC. NASA requirements include the following:</p>\r\n<p>1. Ingest, archive and distribute Earth Science data designated for the EOSDIS SAR DAAC.<br /><br />2. Provide operation and maintenance of the SAR DAAC systems for acquiring, processing, archiving and distribution of data and ancillary data for new and future missions as well as supporting/validation of data from various sources. This may include a broad variety of activities such as systems engineering, operations and maintenance, development, user services, identification and generation of value-added products and services, data and information management, archive and distribution, information technology security, participation in the development of additional tools and capabilities needed to meet the EOSDIS requirements at all DAACs, general user support services, and related science support and research activities.<br /><br />3. Provide documentation and user support on SAR data and services. Keep abreast of uses of the data. Ensure data is archived and served in a way that facilities its use. Recommend to NASA data formats or additional data products and services that might better serve community needs.</p>\r\n<p>4.

Provide tools, services, user interfaces, web infrastructure components for the broad SAR community.</p>\r\n<p>6. Coordinate with other organizations, agencies, DAACs, NASA Centers, and institutions in order to accomplish the goals and objectives of this contract. This includes developing and maintaining interfaces with other EOSDIS organizational elements, other agencies with which EOSDIS must cooperate, NASA's international partners with whom EOSDIS will be interoperable, and a broad variety of international organizations and working groups.</p>\r\n<p>The UAF facility is necessary because it is the only facility in the U.S. that meets the geographic requirements for the collection and processing of SAR data. The UAF ground station is located above Latitude 64N, allowing the greatest number of opportunities to acquire data (in terms of satellite passes) from the RADARSAT, sALOS and data from other polar orbiting spacecraft NASA may&nbsp;acquire data from in the future. A processing facility elsewhere would require the costly and technically difficult transmission of data from the ground station.

The NIAID, has a requirement for continue support of the<br />Immune Epitope and Analysis Resource Program, formerly known as the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Program (IEDB), which provides the research community an easy resource for searching experimental data characterizing antibody and T cell epitopes studied in humans, non-human primates, and other animal species, involved in infectious disease, allergy, autoimmunity, and transplant, and tools to assist in the prediction and analysis of B cell and T cell epitopes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\r\n<p>The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) supports<br />extramural grants and contracts for basic, pre-clinical, and clinical research on<br />immune system development and function, and host immune responses in<br />infectious and immune-mediated disorders (e.g., autoimmunity, allergy/asthma,<br />and transplant rejection). This mission includes support of various reagent facilities,<br />repositories, and databases that provide resources for biomedical researchers. As a<br />part of this continuing effort to support the scientific enterprise, the NIAID<br />announces the renewal of the Immune Epitope and Analysis Resource Program to<br />further develop, populate, and maintain a public resource containing antibody/B cell<br />and T cell epitope information, B cell receptor (BCR/T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire<br />analyses, and epitope prediction and analysis tools for use by the research<br />community worldwide. For this RFP, immune epitopes are defined as molecular<br />structures recognized by specific antigen receptors of the immune system, namely<br />antibodies, BCRs, and TCRs. Immune epitopes involved in infectious and immunemediated diseases and the accompanying biological information will be included in the Immune Epitope and Analysis Resource Program (IEDB).</p>\r\n<p>The effectiveness of adaptive immune responses is related to the diverse functions<br />of B and T cells as well as to interactions with cells of the innate immune system.<br />With respect to diversity, B cells secrete antibodies with different functions and T<br />cells differentiate into subsets that lyse infected target cells, secrete inflammatory<br />and regulatory cytokines, and promote powerful antibody responses. Knowledge of<br />antigen specificity is very important in understanding the generation, maintenance<br />and control of adaptive immunity in infection or immune-mediated diseases. In<br />addition, immune epitopes can be difficult to reliably and accurately predict using<br />current epitope prediction algorithms, especially for antibodies and for MHC<br />molecules that have limited ligand binding data. Therefore, development of<br />improved prediction tools will be greatly enhanced by better information on the<br />epitopes recognized by antibodies/BCRs and TCRs/MHC molecules. Such advances<br />would potentially include better ways to interrogate the repertoire of different B and<br />T cell receptors and their relation to epitope binding in humans and other model<br />immune systems. Overall, understanding the nature of immune epitopes recognized<br />by T and B cells will expedite the development of new therapies to prevent and<br />treat infection, organ and tissue transplant rejection, and autoimmune and allergic<br />disorders.</p>\r\n<p>In December 2003, the NIAID awarded the original IEDB contract to the La Jolla<br />Institute of Allergy and Immunology (N01-AI-40006) and subsequently awarded<br />the successor contract to the same contractor in December 2011<br />(HHSN272201200010C). The IEDB website, containing immune epitope information<br />and analysis tools, became publicly available in 2005 (www.iedb.org) and currently<br />contains detailed information for over 298,000 unique immune epitopes curated<br />from more than 18,000 journal references or direct submissions from the research<br />community related to infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The Analysis<br />Resource includes the following computational/bioinformatics tools:</p>\r\n<p>1. Epitope prediction tools:<br />a. T cell epitope predictions based on MHC class I or class II binding, or<br />peptide processing, or immunogenicity predictions<br />(http://tools.iedb.org/main/tcell/)<br />b. B cell epitope and structure predictions<br />(http://tools.iedb.org/main/bcell/)<br />2. Epitope analysis tools (http://tools.iedb.org/main/analysis-tools/):<br />a. Population coverage - calculates the fraction of individuals predicted to<br />respond to a given set of epitopes with known MHC restrictions.<br />b. Conservancy analysis - determines the degree of conservancy of an<br />epitope within a related protein sequence set at different degrees of<br />sequence identity.<br />c. Cluster analysis - groups epitopes into clusters based on a degree of<br />sequence identity.<br />d. Computational methods for mapping mimotopes to protein antigens -<br />provides information on available methods for mimotope mapping,<br />how to search the IEDB for mimotopes, and an example of a mimotope<br />dataset and the results of its mapping, using other publicly available<br />web servers.</p>\r\n<p>The system architecture and software design specifications and entity relational<br />diagrams of the current IEDB system are available at the IEDB website:<br />http://help.iedb.org/hc/en-us/articles/114094150691-IEDB-System-Architectureand-<br />Design</p>\r\n<p>The main goal of this solicitation is to continue support of the IEDB which provides<br />the research community an easy resource for searching experimental data<br />characterizing antibody and T cell epitopes studied in humans, non-human<br />primates, and other animal species, involved in infectious disease, allergy,<br />autoimmunity, and transplant, and tools to assist in the prediction and analysis of B<br />cell and T cell epitopes. No changes are anticipated to the scope of work from the<br />previous solicitation in terms of the types of immune epitopes to be included in the<br />IEDB. In addition, since this solicitation is a re-competition of an existing public<br />resource, there is no requirement to develop the IEDB and operating system de<br />novo.

The incumbent contractor for CSRR C&M software is Lockheed Martin under contract N00039-13-C-0039.\nThis announcement is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or obligation to issue a future solicitation. This announcement does not commit the Government to contract for any supplies or services. Companies interested in the anticipated RFP should monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov for the release of the RFP.\nThe CSRR was developed as a replacement for the existing OHIO Class submarine Integrated Radio Room (IRR).  CSRR has been implemented on the USS OHIO, USS VIRGINIA, USS SEAWOLF, and USS LOS ANGELES Class submarines.  The CSRR integrates physical components from other Programs Of Record (PORs) (i.e. Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), Digital Modular Radio (DMR), Extremely High Frequency/Follow-On Terminal (EHF/FOT), Global Broadcast Service (GBS), Super High Frequency (SHF), Submarine Single Messaging System (SubSMS), and ancillary equipment) into a common architecture.  The CSRR C&M software effectively manages these physical components to control, process and disseminate Command, Control Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) information to provide the submarine fleet with secure, reliable, and covert communications.\nThe technical approach to this effort is based on the concept of a CSRR that includes a common open systems architecture, common software, common technical documentation, and a single Software Support Activity (SSA).  The common software configuration approach includes the structure of the code; the databases used to track requirements, software source files, baseline documentation, host equipments/processors, and the verification and validation process/ procedures.  The contractor will be required to maintain and provide enhancements to the existing CSRR C&M software, the most recent version of which will be provided to the successful offeror at contract award.  Additionally, access to classified information up to and including Top Secret is anticipated. All necessary security measures will be followed, and will be identified on the CSRR C&M DD Form 254 should procurement take place.\nSpecification documents associated with the CSRR C&M software will be provided to industry on a separate secure site limited to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor the information contained on the website to ensure they are accessing the most recent versions.  To request access to the secure website, each company must sign and return the Non- Disclosure Agreement (NDA) posted on the SPAWAR e-commerce site (https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil) entitled, \"Bidder's Repository NDA\" and provide the e-mail address and phone number for up to two users to Anna Kurzeja, anna.kurzeja@navy.mil.  Each company must also provide a copy of a fully executed DoD DD Form-2345 \"Military Critical Technical Data Agreement\".  If the company does not have an active DD 2345 on file and cannot provide a Joint Certification Program (JCP) number, please visit DLIS at:  http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for more information on how to complete and submit the DD 2345.  Each user is required to be a U.S. DoD contractor and have a valid DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or ECA issued PKI certificate to gain access to the website.  If an interested company is a U.S. DoD contractor and does not have a valid DoD or ECA - issued PKI certificate, contact Kymberlee Boisvert for further instruction at kymberlee.boisvert@navy.mil.  Once status as a US DoD contractor has been confirmed, the Government will provide instructions on how to access the secured site.\nQuestions and comments regarding the specification documents are requested to be submitted no later than 26 May 2017. Questions and comments are requested to be submitted in writing via e-mail only to: Anna Kurzeja, Contract Specialist, SPAWAR 2.1B19, (anna.kurzeja@navy.mil).  Verbal questions and comments will not be accepted. The Government will provide public answers to all questions and comments received regarding the specification documents and anticipated RFP via the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website.  All questions and comments shall be in a format non-attributable to the company or individual submitting the questions or comments to allow for public release.\nThe Government anticipates issuing a Cost type contract.  The period of performance will be five (5) years (one base year and four one-year options).\nThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330-Engineering Services.\nThe estimated date for solicitation release is October 2017.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DON/SPAWAR/SPAWARHQ/N00039-17-R-0056/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"anna.kurzeja@navy.mil","DESC3":"Contract Specialist","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"1228","YEAR":"17","AGENCY":"Department of the Air Force","OFFICE":"Air Force Materiel Command","LOCATION":"AFRL/RIK -  Rome","ZIP":"13441-4514","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"541715","OFFADD":"26 Electronic Parkway Rome NY 13441-4514","SUBJECT":"Multi-Source Exploitation Assistant for the Digital Enterprise (MEADE)","SOLNBR":"FA8750-18-S-7005","CONTACT":"Brian O'Hern, BAA PROGRAM MANAGER, Phone 315-330-3995, Email brian.ohern@us.af.mil - Gail E.

The contractor shall provide services to all tenants of the Readiness and Health Directorate in its mission to support the management of readiness and health.  The three major functional areas will be Health Management, Logistic Support, and Operational Support.  The contract type is anticipated to be a cost type;  single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract.\n  \n\nThe mission of BUMED is to enable readiness and health for Sailors, Marines and their families. In support of this, an underlying and fundamental need for a culture of health and safety is essential to not only prepare but also strengthen and build the resilience of a ready fighting force. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requires Navy Medicine (NAVMED) to implement measures to maintain the critical wartime medical readiness skills and core competencies of health care providers (HCP) within our MTF’s and   emphasizes transforming to a High Reliability Organization (HRO).  Additionally, Navy Medicine is facing other key changes in the upcoming years such as the impending transition to the new Electronic Health Record (EHR), a shift of patient and provider expectation for the millennial generation, and increased demand for incorporating digital technologies within the healthcare experience.\n  With the magnitude and pace of change occurring at BUMED and the Military Health System (MHS), consistent program support is critical in sustaining operations, transitioning programs, and implementing new initiatives.  This will require a marked increase in oversight and management by BUMED in the overall Readiness portfolio.\n\nThis is a new requirement for BUMED.  The anticipated period of performance is expected to begin 1 August 2018 and continue through 31 July 2019.  There are expected to be provisions for option years to extend services until 31 July 2022.  \n\nTHIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.

THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. AN RFP WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT NOVEMBER 3, 2017.\r\n<p>Background:</p>\r\n<p>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to solicit proposals to establish an Indefinite-delivery, Indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) Task Order (TO) contract to support clinical activities for continuing the Pediatric Trials Network (PTN). The successful offeror shall provide the requisite personnel, facilities and services to establish, conduct, and support pediatric clinical trials and related services including: expert consultation; pediatric clinical pharmacology; product formulation; drug distribution; and device development. Data collected from the PTN will help inform pediatric labeling, and be used to develop publications and other materials that will provide pediatricians and researchers with new information on medication disposition and response in children.</p>\r\n<p>The main objective of this project is to create an environment by which a Contractor can operate an effective infrastructure for conducting safe and effective pediatric clinical trials and for performing ancillary activities in support of these trials. Although the primary focus of this Contract is to support the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act-Pediatric Trials Network clinical activities, NICHD also anticipates the need to utilize this Contract to acquire similar types of support for other NICHD pediatric drug development activities.</p>\r\n<p>BPCA 2017 authorizes NICHD to identify therapeutic gaps in pediatrics, which are pediatric diseases, disorders or conditions where more complete knowledge and testing of therapeutics (including drugs, devices and biologics) can be beneficial to the pediatric population. There is currently inadequate infrastructure to perform these pediatric research clinical trials, and inadequate numbers of clinicians trained to perform this research.</p>\r\n<p>NICHD anticipates the need to initiate activities in approximately five (5) to ten (10) therapeutic areas, with multiple therapeutic approaches for each therapeutic area. The work will be performed under individual task orders. It is therefore likely that these activities will require multiple scientific and clinical investigators with expertise in various disease areas. At the present time, NICHD is anticipating, but will not be limited to, initiating studies in the following therapeutic areas:</p>\r\n<p>&#61607; Cardiovascular diseases, including the treatment of hypertension; <br />&#61607; Infectious diseases; <br />&#61607; Respiratory diseases, including the treatment of asthma; <br />&#61607; Gastroenterology;<br />&#61607; Acute Care;<br />&#61607; Neonatal therapeutic areas;<br />&#61607; Obesity related pharmacology;<br />&#61607; Biodefense;<br />&#61607; Neuro/Psych;</p>\r\n<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) along with the Contractor, may interact with researchers who either currently are (or will be) performing pre-clinical and clinical trial activities with researchers engaged in other NIH trials, e.g., the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).</p>\r\n<p>As a result of this announcement the NICHD anticipates awarding a single cost reimbursement completion IDIQ type contract with a period of performance of eight (8) years beginning on or about March 14, 2018. The NICHD anticipates the Request for Proposals (RFP) for this study will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/) on or about November 3, 2017. Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the RFP issue date. Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement. This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541715 (formerly 541712) with a size standard of 1,000 employees.

The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative technology demonstrations that address DoD environmental and installation energy requirements as candidates for funding. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the ESTCP website.<br /><br />The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found at https://www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/ESTCP-Solicitations. To be eligible for consideration, parties wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the instructions on the website, no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 8, 2018. No electronic mail, faxed, or hard copy proposals will be accepted.<br /><br />No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. It is the sole responsibility of the offerors to make certain the proposal is properly received by ESTCP. Awards will take the form of contracts. Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals or travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals.<br /><br />There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $12 million will result, depending on availability of funds.<br /><br />Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by ESTCP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether ESTCP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions located on the ESTCP website, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Cost/Benefit of Technology, Transition Potential, and Cost of Proposal. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, the Government will not provide debriefs to those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.<br /><br />Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the Government's goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $700,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor.

NO QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS SYNOPSIS WILL BE ANSWERED.\r\n<p>The Physical Acoustics Branch at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for Laboratory and at Sea Acoustic Techniques research and development. This acquisition will be for the creation of algorithms and computational tools for modeling, to create prototype structural acoustics sonars for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), mine countermeasures (MCM), counter unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) efforts, and the signal processing and classifiers for these new sonars.<br />The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541715 with the size standard of 1000 employees. The Product Service Code (PSC) is AJ13.</p>\r\n<p>Detailed requirements, including a Performance Work Statement, Personnel Requirements, Contract Data Requirements, and a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, will be included in the solicitation file.  SECRET Facility and SECRET Personnel clearances shall be required in accordance with a DD-254 Contract Security Classification Specification. The anticipated period of performance for any resulting contract will be one year, with four one-year options. The Government anticipates award of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Term Contract for the requirement.</p>\r\n<p>The Physical Acoustics Branch at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) carries out theoretical and experimental studies of acousto-elastic systems and parameters by means of physical techniques, and of physical systems and parameters by means of acousto-elastic techniques. The Branch's main laboratory capability is on the Washington DC campus of NRL.  The theoretical programs are carried out in acoustics, in acousto-elastic interactions and in structural acoustics. A primary area of focus is acousto-elastic scattering and radiation.  In this regard techniques are utilized to model the elastic vibration of fluid-loaded structures and the resulting scattered and radiated fields.  In particular there is an interest in modeling the response of complex structures of arbitrary geometry over a frequency range for which such modeling has not previously been possible.  This entails the development of radically new approaches and formulations. Other topics currently of interest include: 1) inverse scattering, and optimization, and 2) image enhancement, detection, identification, and automated target recognition.</p>\r\n<p>The experimental programs are carried out in a laboratory setting with a number of at-sea and field components involving technology demonstration objectives.  The Government owned experimental facilities include large indoor water tanks and associated instrumentation and computer networks for acoustic studies. It also includes electronic and mechanical fabrication and design work spaces, clean rooms, and associated computer network computational capabilities. Regarding computational capabilities, access to national high performance computing capabilities are also employed. A large component of the work is carried out in two holographically-based acoustic pool facilities developed and operated by NRL, and its low temperature phonon-microstructure laboratory.  Major focuses include structural acoustics of large scale, complex systems and the elasto-dynamics of micro-structures.  The fundamental studies are complemented by more applied programs, which include programs on fiber-optic sensors, Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Nano Electro Mechanical Systems (NEMS) sensing/processing, high-Q oscillators, target model studies, submarine acoustics, unmanned underwater vehicle acoustics (UUVs), seismic/acoustic intruder detection and detection of sea mine deployments, buried mine identification, Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) identification, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection, anechoic coating, acoustic visualization, and ship/aircraft interior acoustic noise reduction. In carrying out the above programs, the Physical Acoustics Branch invents, develops, implements, and upgrades a number of acoustic measurement techniques and facilities.  Examples include:  the Branch's new structural acoustics air facility and acoustic pool facilities with their associated robotic scanners, near field holography processing systems, and digital processing and display equipment; the Branch's low temperature micro-structures laboratory; the Branch's state-of-the-art scanning Lase Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) and Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscope (NSOM) capabilities; the Branch's fiber optic/electro-optic sensor system laboratory; several unique at-sea measurements systems; and the Branch's computer network servicing these various facilities.</p>\r\n<p>To be eligible for award, offerors shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.

The NIAID Divisions of AIDS (DAIDS); Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT); and Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) have a joint requirement for development of the Immune Mechanisms of Protection Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis center (IMPAc-TB) program to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature, location and timing of protective immune responses required to prevent initial Mtb infection, development of stable latent infection, or transition to active TB disease.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\r\n<p>The goal of this program is to establish an integrated multi-disciplinary team of highly collaborative investigators that will plan and conduct iterative, in-depth immunologic analyses of tissue-specific and systemic responses in small animals, non-human primates (NHPs), and humans to identify the key immune responses needed for protection against Mtb; identify immunologic targets that can be used to improve TB vaccine strategies; determine the impact of HIV/SIV and Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) infection(s) on relevant immune responses to Mtb infection or TB vaccines; and identify how bacterial immune evasion mechanisms subvert immune responses to Mtb.</p>\r\n<p>The IMPAc-TB team will be expected to develop Standard Operating Procedures and assay harmonization methods to be implemented by the center's members; conduct in-depth immunologic analyses of tissue-specific and systemic responses against Mtb/TB in small animals, non-human primates (NHPs), and humans, including examination of host responses to BCG or novel, promising vaccine candidates (pre- and/or post-exposure candidates); collaborate with existing NIAID-supported and other TB programs; and distribute positive and negative study results, reagents and other resources within a center, between centers (if applicable), to other NIAID-supported programs, and the broader research community to facilitate the development of improved TB vaccines.</p>\r\n<p>To achieve the IMPAc-TB program goals, Contractors will be responsible for the following activities:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Leadership structure: providing a Leadership Team to oversee center activities and be responsible for the planning and conduct of the IMPAc-TB center's proposed studies</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Data and resource management system used for the storage, retrieval and analysis of center-generated data; cataloging/reporting of all center-generated reagents and research resources; and sharing of positive and negative study results and research resources within the center, to other NIAID-supported programs, and the broader research community in a timely manner through existing NIAID-supported programs (e.g., ImmPort, the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (PATRIC), BEI Resources) or other public portals or repositories designated by NIAID.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Conduct in-depth immunologic analyses to provide novel insights into the immune responses required to (1) protect a host from initial Mtb infection, (2) establish a latent infection, and/or (3) progress to active TB disease. These in-depth immune analyses should include a systemic analysis (i.e., not limited to a single component) of the immune system. Each IMPAc-TB team must examine at least two (2) of these three (3) Mtb/TB stages and conduct iterative immunologic studies using small animal models, non-human primate (NHP) and human studies. The immunologic studies should seek to move beyond analysis of single arms of the immune system and progress toward understanding how complex immune networks and interacting components generate a given biological outcome. The use of relevant small animal models that go beyond commonly used laboratory mouse strains is strongly encouraged.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a SPP agreement, ACT agreement, or CRADA agreement.\r\n<p>THE TECHNOLOGY:  <br />PNNL has developed a method of imaging the subsurface electrical conductivity distribution that removes the effects of the subsurface metallic structures, enabling more accurate assessment and execution of ERT imaging within industrial areas. ERT works by injecting current into the subsurface across a pair of electrodes and measuring the corresponding electrical potential response across another pair of electrodes. Many such measurements are strategically taken across an array of electrodes to produce an ERT data set. These data are then processed to produce an image of the subsurface conductivity structure. PNNL's E4D software applies a numerical correction to simulate the presence of metallic structures at known locations and dimensions. The method then removes the influence of these structures on the results to show a more accurate image. The process is flexible and customizable to a particular problem, making it suitable for both advanced research applications and more common imaging.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to modeling the influence of metallic structures on the subsurface potential distribution, PNNL's method allows those structures to be used as current injection and/or potential measurement electrodes, thereby expanding ERT capabilities. The method can also model structures that are discontinuous in space, but electrically connected (for example, two or more buried tanks connected by above-ground transfer piping). Because PNNL's method enables ERT to focus on estimating soil conductivity, engineers have the opportunity to 1) accurately assess whether imaging in areas with dense metallic infrastructure is feasible, 2) determine what electrode configurations and survey geometries are required to effectively image in the presence of metallic infrastructure, and 3) significantly improve modeling capabilities in areas with conductive infrastructure.

The end goal of DTTBI is a commercial TBI drug product that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat moderate - severe TBI.<br /></strong>&nbsp;\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">MTEC:</span></strong><br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, \"non-traditional\" government contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Technical Background:</span></strong><br />Treating traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the top priorities for the Department of Defense (DoD). The DoD and the military services require solutions to fill the capability gap to treat TBI as close to point of injury as possible. The current standard of care for TBI remains supportive in nature, based on management of symptoms, with no drug therapies that address the brain damage. Despite numerous clinical trials on potential therapies, there is no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug therapy for the treatment of TBI. TBI has been shown to increase long-term mortality and reduce life expectancy. Estimated economic costs of care for TBI are &gt;$75B per year according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Therefore, it is important to develop a therapy that will decrease lost duty time and mitigate the life-long disability and rehabilitation costs associated with these post-injury conditions.</p>\r\n<p>&emsp;<br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Overall Program Objective:</span></strong><br />The overall objective of the Drug Treatment for TBI (DTTBI) program is to rapidly advance the development of TBI drug candidate prototypes, through focused Phase 2 clinical trial testing, to produce a TBI drug(s) that has been fully characterized and has the best chance for success in a Phase 3 trial.</p>\r\n<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking proposals for utilization of an already established and experienced TBI Clinical Consortium (TBI CC) that will enable the rapid development and clinical testing of TBI drug candidates currently in FDA-regulated clinical development. Through this RPP, the DoD will establish a contractual relationship with an existing TBI CC, and fund the evaluation of several drug candidates (potentially in collaboration with non-DoD sources of funding) in Phase 2 clinical trials.</p>\r\n<p>Drug candidates for consideration must have already successfully completed Phase 1 clinical studies and will be jointly selected by the TBI CC management, associated subject matter experts, and the DoD Government Steering Committee. It is the DoD's expectation that the TBI CC shall design and execute focused Phase 2 clinical trials on multiple TBI drug candidate prototypes, to enhance the Phase 2 data set and reduce the overall risk of future investment into a Phase 3 clinical trial.</p>\r\n<p>The deliverable at the end of the award's period of performance is to demonstrate efficacy in Phase 2 clinical trials with at least one TBI candidate drug and recommend its continued development toward FDA regulatory clearance. The overall end goal of the DTTBI program is a commercial drug product that is approved by the FDA to treat TBI.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Financial Framework: <br /></span></strong>The DTTBI MTEC award has a Milestone and Deliverable dependent incremental funding structure, with a total of approximately $25M over a five-year period of performance.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Administrative Information:</span></strong><br />The MTEC RPP for DTTBI is anticipated to be released no later than mid-February of 2018.

STMD investments in space technology research at U.S. universities promote the continued leadership of our universities as an international symbol of the country's scientific innovation, engineering creativity, and technological skill. These investments also create, fortify, and nurture the talent base of highly skilled engineers, scientists, and technologists to improve America's technological and economic competitiveness.</p>\r\n<p>The following topics are anticipated for the final appendix: Batteries for Extreme Cold Environments; MOF and Ionic Liquids/Membrane Technologies for Advanced CO2 Removal Applications; Entry Guidance Methods for Precision Planetary Landers.</p>\r\n<p>Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology.

An effort spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) led to the eradication of smallpox disease in the 1970s, with the last case of smallpox diagnosed in 1977. While smallpox disease is eradicated, repositories of VARV remain, it is still considered one of the most dangerous human pathogens as it is highly communicable and carries exceptionally high morbidity; the two known repositories are in the Russian Federation and the United States. Furthermore, recent advances in synthetic biology allow for the creation of smallpox viruses from published genomic sequences available to the public.</p>\r\n<p>Medical countermeasures (MCM) against Smallpox are urgently needed should future outbreaks of Smallpox occur. The 2014 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy and Implementation Plan identifies Smallpox as a high-priority threat as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.</p>\r\n<p>Vaccines are no longer administered to the US population (outside of military recruits and first responders) and there are no therapeutic agents available on the market to treat symptomatic smallpox. To counter the threat, the US Government stockpiles both a large quantity of smallpox vaccine intended for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and a limited quantity of antiviral therapeutics intended to treat symptomatic patients during the course of a smallpox event. The government has pursued this multi-faceted approach with the goal of being able to rapidly deploy lifesaving therapeutics to an effected population during a smallpox event and to provide sufficient vaccine to protect the population surrounding an effected area or those who are considered at risk of infection.</p>\r\n<p>While there is a licensed vaccine for the pre-exposure prophylaxis against smallpox, there are currently no approved therapeutic antivirals for the treatment of symptomatic smallpox. BARDA is seeking to procure smallpox therapeutic antiviral agents for the Strategic National Stockpile that can be used in the event of an outbreak to treat symptomatic patients.</p>\r\n<p>All proposals submitted to any future solicitations shall have evidence of two formulations of the antiviral (parenteral and nonparenteral), an active FDA IND or licensed product with completed phase I trials for both products, evidence of efficacy in at least two animal models accepted by the FDA for the evaluation of a smallpox medical countermeasure, and the ability of the Offeror to deliver at least one formulation to the SNS upon contract award (e.g. FDA approval, pre-EUA IND on file).</p>\r\n<p><br />Pre-Solicitation Notice Objective</p>\r\n<p>This Pre-solicitation Notice is issued pursuant to FAR Subpart 5.2. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This Pre-solicitation Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, AMCG is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>\r\n<p>It is anticipated that an RFP may be available electronically through the FedBizOpps website in February 2018 for 45 days with proposals being due in April 2018. Once any RFP is posted we encourage all responsible sources, particularly small businesses, to submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor this internet site (www.fbo.gov) for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>\r\n<p>It is anticipated that one contract award with both cost reimbursement and firm-fixed CLINs will be awarded by July 2018.

These increases will result in the creation of new jobs, which will increase the incomes of people currently unemployed or underemployed, including women and youth, contributing thereby to a growing, inclusive economy. \n\nThe anticipated Project will apply a market-driven approach starting with the market – operationally, buyers – and work backwards to help firms solve the constraints that stand in the way of their selling more and increasing sales and profitability.  \n\nThe Project consists of two primary components as follows: \n\n1.\tComponent I will focus on transactional support where the Contractor’s technical assistance will help firms take the actions required to address the client firms’ business problems with business solutions and ultimately increase sales, exports, investment, productivity, and jobs.  \n\n2.\tComponent II will work with firms as well as private sector growth-focused entities, such as trade and business organizations or government institutions, to focus on removing systemic constraints (policy or institutional) that prevent sales transactions from taking place. \n\nProspective Offerors are advised that issuance of the RFP solicitation and award of a contract are subject to the availability of funds, as certain procedural and legislative requirements for obligating funds have not yet been met.\n\nThe place of performance under the anticipated contract is the West Bank and Gaza.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/AID/OM/WES/72029418R00002/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0213","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Other Defense Agencies","OFFICE":"United States Transportation Command","LOCATION":"USTRANSCOM Command Acquisition","ZIP":"62225","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"541330","OFFADD":"508 Scott Drive\r\nBldg 1900 Scott AFB IL 62225","SUBJECT":"HTC711-18-Z-D010","SOLNBR":"HTC711-18-Z-D010","RESPDATE":"022818","CONTACT":"CRYSTAL AMOS, Contract Specialist, Phone 6182206729, Email CRYSTAL.S.AMOS.CIV@MAIL.MIL - Matthew J.

manpower assessment; planning and programming analysis support; financial program management; manpower, personnel, training and education program and policy assessment and management; quantitative analysis;  forecasting; performance assessment; and research, development, test and evaluation program management support.\n  The support is for strategic and operational level issue support regarding current and future initiatives across the MPTE domain.  \n\nThe support will require direct liaison with action officers and program managers across the MPTE domain as well as all other Navy Enterprises and Enablers to support the development and refinement of MPTE programs and policies.  The contractors will provide a continuum of business management support to MPTE leadership, managers, action officers, program managers and analysts. \n \nThe services are required both on-site, primarily in the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area, Millington, TN, and Pensacola, FL, and off-site.  Some work may be required on-site at various other locations within the contiguous United States.\n  Travel is anticipated.  The Government anticipates performance will begin on 31 July 2018 and will continue, as required, for nine years thereafter.  For planning purposes, the total estimated yearly level of effort (LOE) is 289,920 hours (or 2,609,280 hours over the nine year period).  The applicable NAICs code is 541611 “Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.”  The small business size standard for this NAICS is $15 million in annual receipts.\n\nIt is the intent of the Government to process this procurement under FAR 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and to ultimately award multiple, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts as a result of the forthcoming solicitation.\n  The IDIQ contracts will allow for both CPFF and firm-fixed-price (FFP) type task orders.  Offerors will be required to submit non-cost/price (technical) and cost/price proposals.  The Government anticipates that the resultant contracts will be awarded on a best value basis where the non-cost/price (technical) volume will be considered more important than the cost/price volume.  \n\nUpon its release, the solicitation will be issued electronically and be available for downloading at the NECO website:  http://www.neco.navy.mil or http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 1 March 2018.    The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP.  Paper copies, faxed copies, or email copies of the solicitation will not be provided.\n  Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the RFP and any amendments thereto.  The Government will not pay for the information received.  \n\nAll responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by NAVSUP FLC Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office.  By submitting an offer, the offeror is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award.\n  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

New pathogens, both naturally occurring and adversary-engineered, are increasingly likely to emerge due to changes in the environment, rising global population, and the wide availability of genetic engineering tools to both state and non-state actors. These factors, coupled with faster potential dispersal due to increasing global travel and population density, have significantly increased the danger posed by bacterial pathogens. Current detection strategies based on biochemical markers would not work on previously undiscovered bacteria or on bacteria designed to evade detection. Moreover, genetic sequencing and omics analyses are insufficient to address this growing challenge, since the phenotype of a pathogen might not be determinable from the genetic make-up (i.e., the genotype) alone. The novel capability developed under FoF will provide detailed, high-throughput phenotype-based characterization of unknown bacteria through identification of pathogenic traits. Specifically, the technology should reliably extract representative samples of bacteria from complex environments, maintain their viability while they are repeatedly interrogated to identify virulence factors, and then analyze them using an omics approach that leverages external pathogen and gene databases. Ultimately, this technology will detect bacterial pathogens as, or even before, they emerge as a threat to the public.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/HR001118S0025/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"HR001118S0025@darpa.mil","DESC3":"HR001118S0025@darpa.mil","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0216","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Health and Human Services","OFFICE":"Food and Drug Administration","LOCATION":"Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services - Rockville","ZIP":"20857-0001","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"541690","OFFADD":"5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2129 Rockville MD 20857-0001","SUBJECT":"INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT-SAS PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT HOURS","SOLNBR":"FDA-NOI-1192742","RESPDATE":"030118","CONTACT":"Tara R.

As part of this mission, DARPA makes high-risk, high-reward investments in science and technology that have the potential to disrupt current understanding and/or approaches. The pace of discovery in both science and technology is accelerating worldwide, resulting in new fields of study and the identification of scientific areas ripe for disruption. While DARPA's existing investment strategy continues to yield success, in order to capitalize on these new opportunities, its approach to investing must include faster responses with more small, targeted investments. This new approach is called Disruptioneering. Disruptioneering will enable DARPA to initiate a new investment in less than 90 days from idea inception.<br /><br />\r\n<p>To enable this approach, the Defense Sciences Office (DSO) will issue Disruption Opportunities (DO) via targeted Special Notices (SN). These Special Notices will focus on technical domains important to DSO's mission pursuing innovative research concepts that explore Frontiers in Math, Computation and Design; Limits of Sensing and Sensors; Complex Social Systems; and Anticipating Surprise. More information about DSO's technical domains and research topics of interest may be found at http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/offices/dso.</p>\r\n<p>Disruption Opportunities will be announced via Special Notices issued under this Program Announcement (PA), DARPA-PA-18-01. These DO Special Notices will solicit proposals and will be open for at least 30 days from publication at https://www.fbo.gov/. DOs will describe rapid projects addressing two phases as described below. During these periods of performance, very high-risk, high-reward topics will be investigated with the goal of determining feasibility and clarifying whether the area is ready for increased investment. The ultimate goal of each DO is to invest in research that leads to prototype development that may result in new game-changing technologies for U.S. national security. Proposals submitted in response to DOs will be evaluated and selected in accordance with Section 6 of this solicitation.</p>\r\n<p>See DARPA-PA-18-01.</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-PA-18-01/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0220","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","OFFICE":"Goddard Space Flight Center","LOCATION":"Code 210.Y","ZIP":"20771","CLASSCOD":"D","NAICS":"541511","OFFADD":"NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 210.Y Greenbelt MD 20771","SUBJECT":"Continued development and maintenance of algorithms supporting the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument","SOLNBR":"80GSFC18R0039","RESPDATE":"032018","CONTACT":"Joel Rivera, Phone 3012863947, Email joel.rivera@nasa.gov","DESC":"NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the development and maintenance of algorithms supporting the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on the NASA Terra spacecraft for a period of two years, with one option period of one year.<br /><br />NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from the National Center for Atmospheric Research/University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (NCAR/UCAR) in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding established between the Canadian Space Agency and NASA that identifies NCAR/UCAR as the team leader for the development and maintenance of algorithms for the NASA Terra Spacecraft instrument MOPITT.

The FEHB Program covers approximately 8.3 million lives and provides about $53 billion a year in healthcare benefits.\r\n<p>OPM aims to improve the health of the populations we serve, ensure the delivery of high quality consumer focused health care, and provide Federal employees, annuitants, and other statutorily eligible individuals with affordable insurance benefits. To reward quality care, OPM evaluates FEHB carriers on key parameters of clinical quality, customer service, resource use, and contract oversight through the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment. Many aspects of the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment framework rely on measures from the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS).</p>\r\n<p>Scoring measures against national benchmarks helps OPM recognize top plans in the program, inform enrollee choice, and link objective performance to profit factors. In addition, the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment aligns OPM required health plan measures with other major systems of measurement, without creating a disparate set of measures unique to the FEHB Program.</p>\r\n<p>OPM has collected FEHB Carrier HEDIS and CAHPS measures for many years. The first year of FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment scoring was in 2016. For 2017, we added an Improvement Increment to the Clinical Quality, Customer Service and Resource Use (QCR) score. FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment guidance and instructions are issued to FEHB Carriers via Carrier Letters which are available on the OPM website at https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/carriers/#url=Archive.</p>\r\n<p>OPM seeks technical expertise and data systems capabilities to collect, calculate, aggregate, and report measurement data related to the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment. The additional services provided under the proposed contract will streamline data reporting and analyses, expand the capacity of OPM to utilize a broader range of relevant measures along with appropriate benchmarks or reference ranges, and strengthen the integrity of the performance calculation process. The required expertise to perform these specific services includes healthcare analytical system proficiencies, as well as subject matter expertise in healthcare measure development, evaluation, and reporting. The successful offeror must demonstrate detailed evidence of their experience in the areas of clinical quality, customer service, resource use, and quality assurance evaluation, as well as health plan efficiency measurement. Due to the technical nature of this project, extensive experience in the details of measure auditing and reporting is required, including but not limited to the NCQA HEDIS Audit and the CAHPS Survey. Having provided a similar scope of data evaluation and aggregation services to large commercial or government entities is highly desirable. In addition to the technical expertise described above, OPM is seeking a collaborator with the vision and capability to help refine the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment methodology as new measures are added and trends are elucidated.</p>\r\n<p>OPM has published the FEHB Program Plan Performance Assessment methodology and reporting instructions through a series of Carrier Letters. The offeror is expected to be familiar with published OPM materials, including material provided at https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/carriers/#url=Performance-Assessment.</p>\r\n<p>We will procure the proposed acquisition using full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12 in conjunction with FAR Part 15. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which we will consider.</p>\r\n<p>The proposed contract will be firm-fixed-price. The performance period for the proposed contract is expected to be five years: a one-year base period and four one-year options.</p>\r\n<p>OPM intends to issue a request for proposals (RFP) on or about March 12, 2018. The RFP and all documents relating to this requirement will only be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO website for release of the RFP and all other documents relating to this requirement. We encourage interested parties to register on the FBO website for e-mail notification of all actions relating to the RFP and for the interested vendors list. After we release the RFP, we will give interested parties the opportunity to ask questions. We will include all questions and answers in an amendment to the RFP and post the amendment on the FBO web site.</p>\r\n<p>Proposals will be due on or about April 11, 2018. We anticipate awarding the proposed contract by July 31, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>This is a new requirement.

The Government intends to issue RFP No. N01TR-19-2005, titled \"CRO Support for NCATS Animal Model Development and In Vivo Pharmacology Studies and Related Services,\" via FedBizOpps on or about March 30, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>REQUIREMENT AND TYPE OF SERVICE</p>\r\n<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development.<br />The objective of this contract is to support the DPI drug development programs by providing services related to the development of animal models and the execution of in vivo pharmacology and related studies, including the use of relevant supporting services needed to accomplish requested tasks.<br />The DPI program requires confirmation and verification of the efficacy of development compounds in an acceptable animal model of the disease. To accomplish this endeavor, DPI has a need for novel, re-developed, optimized, or use of existing, validated animal models to conduct in vivo pharmacology studies for rare disorders and neglected diseases. These models are not able to be pre-determined as needs change depending on the disease; as such, access to both small (e.g., mice, rat) and large (e.g., dog, cat, monkey, pig) models are needed. In addition, therapies can cover a wide range of modalities, small molecules, and biologics (e.g. antibody, proteins, and cell and gene therapy).<br />While this contract will be primarily in support of the DPI drug development programs. The Government reserves the right to allow other drug development programs at NIH to solicit task order proposals. As such, this contract is not limited to rare or neglected disorders.<br />RELEASE OF SOLICITATION</p>\r\n<p>The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposals on or about March 30, 2018. Proposals will be due 45 calendar days following release of the RFP.</p>\r\n<p>The Government anticipates making single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract awards -with the eventual contract being administered and funded via Task Orders (TO). <br />The ultimate goal of DPI and this planned project is to bring new drugs to market. To this end, the Government has issued a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses at 52.227-11 Patent Rights and 52.227-14 Rights in Data. The deviated language enables DPI contributors to retain control of their intellectual property and will be included in the RFP and incorporated in any resultant contract. Prospective Offerors are advised that agreement to the terms of these FAR clauses deviations will be a condition for contract award.</p>\r\n<p>This is a new requirement; therefore, no incumbent information is provided. The Government will select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the basis of award included in the solicitation.</p>\r\n<p>The Government anticipates awards will be made in the first quarter of FY2019.</p>\r\n<p>ABOUT DPI AND NCATS</p>\r\n<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) conducts translational research in human therapeutics development and aims to move small molecule and biologic drug candidates forward in the drug development pipeline to predetermined milestones, at which point, DPI will hand off the drug candidate to external partner(s) to bring the novel therapy to patients.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to developing new candidate drugs, DPI seeks to advance the entire field of drug discovery and development by encouraging scientific and technological innovations aimed at improving success rates in the crucial pre-clinical stage of drug development. DPI's model is to operate as a full range small molecule and biologics drug development organization, moving drug candidates through each phase of the pre-clinical drug development process until an IND is filed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>\r\n<p>DPI conducts drug development as collaborations through programs such as the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) and the Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) programs. DPI drug development programs originate from academia, industry, non-profit foundations, or internally from NCATS and other NIH institutes, and its R&amp;D operational strategy is to combine the capabilities of DPI in-house staff and DPI partners, who may be the drug originators. Each drug program operates in a multi-disciplinary, multi-partnership matrix team environment, and a DPI program officer (PO) is responsible for the overall planning, execution, and reporting of the program.</p>\r\n<p>Contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) provide DPI with manufacturing, pharmacology, toxicology, regulatory, and clinical operations services to assist with drug development. Planning and execution of each individual drug development program includes identification of scientific areas best suited for utilization of CROs and CMOs to conduct some or all parts of a given drug development program.</p>\r\n<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS</p>\r\n<p>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences<br />NINDS R&amp;D Contracts Management Branch<br />6001 Executive Blvd<br />Suite 3287, MSC 9531<br />Bethesda, MD 20892-9531*<br />*Use Rockville, MD 20852 for FedEx/USPS/Courier/Hand Delivery</p>\r\n<p>Primary Point of Contact:</p>\r\n<p>Jessica Adams<br />Contract Specialist<br />jessica.adams@nih.gov<br />Phone: 301-443-8761</p>\r\n<p>Secondary Point of Contract:</p>\r\n<p>Jeffrey R.

This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice of an upcoming action in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 5.204.\r\n<p>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.</p>\r\n<p>This Pre-Solicitation Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>\r\n<p>Respondents are advised that NIST will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this Pre-Solicitation Notice.</p>\r\n<p>The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP&reg;) is a program of the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The MEP National Network<sup>TM</sup> comprises NIST MEP, 51 MEP Centers located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and its 1,300 trusted advisors and experts at nearly 600 MEP service locations, providing any U.S. manufacturer with access to resources they need to succeed. MEP Centers are funded by a combination of Federal, State, local and private resources; and focus on helping small and medium-size manufacturers (SMMs)generate business results and thrive in today's technology-driven economy.</p>\r\n<p>MEP's mission is to enhance the productivity and technology performance of U.S. manufacturing by acting as a trusted, strategic advisor to promote business growth and connecting manufacturers to public and private resources essential for increased competitiveness and profitability. Centers tailor services to meet critical needs, ranging from process improvement and workforce development to specialized business practices, including supply chain integration, innovation, and technology transfer. MEP's foundation is built upon its partnerships. Centers are the hub for manufacturers, connecting them with government agencies, trade associations, universities and research laboratories, state and federal initiatives, and a host of other resources to help them grow and innovate.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, NIST's MEP has a need for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to assist MEP in successfully fulfilling their mission, as stated above. One of the principle goals of this requirement is to for the Contractor to understand the current and future development and delivery capabilities of the network. This will be accomplished by establishing mechanisms to discover the current and future needs of U.S.-based small manufacturers and translating that information into actionable strategies and plans to enhance the development, delivery and quality of products and services delivered by the Centers and foster coordination of those organizations that comprise this network. The contract will provide additional resources and subject matter expertise to expand and accelerate MEP's ability to serve as a trusted advisor for U.S. manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, strategies and plans will be developed and executed to support expansion and deeper leverage of resources to integrate cost reduction strategies with profitable growth.

Oyler, Contract Specialist, Phone 4123864450, Email ycy4@cdc.gov","DESC":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Office of Acquisition Services (OAS) on behalf of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the National Personal Protective Technologies Laboratory (NPPTL) intends to issue a solicitation for an initiative is to determine the feasibility and capability of U.S. healthcare delivery organizations to routinely use reusable respirators and/or rapidly convert to their use during a public health emergency.<br /><br />It is intended that multiple contracts will be awarded as a result of the upcoming solicitation. <br /><br />Background Information:<br />The demand for the respiratory protective devices (RPD) worn by U.S. healthcare personnel (HCP) during a large respiratory infectious disease outbreak, such as an influenza pandemic, is expected to far exceed domestic supplies. Approximately 3.6 billion disposable and 1.6 million reusable respirators may be needed. A rapid increase in RPD usage was apparent during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). During these events, HCP reported that N95 filtering facepiece respirators were not readily available in some locations due to exhaustion of available supplies, inability of suppliers and manufacturers to meet the surge in demand, and shortages of fit testing equipment.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that healthcare facilities stockpile a six to eight-week supply of disposable N95s, however achieving this recommendation has been a challenge for many due to financial limitations. In 2012, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials estimated that U.S. acute care hospitals have 60 million N95 respirators on hand, two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated demand during a severe influenza pandemic. This underscores the importance of including RPD in the Strategic National Stockpile maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br /><br />Wider utilization of reusable elastomeric respirators, which can be cleaned and repeatedly worn, are being considered as one way to mitigate shortages of disposable N95 respirators during public health emergencies. The Veterans Health Administration recently stockpiled elastomeric respirators for use during a surge in demand for N95 respirators. The National Academy of Medicine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration have recently held stakeholder meetings to assess, in part, the potential future role of elastomeric respirators in healthcare delivery. In 2013, Worksafe British Columbia issued a report about the use of elastomeric respirators during a surge in demand. In 2009, the University of Maryland Medical System began fitting HCP with elastomeric respirators to wear during patient care. Another study by the Veterans Health Administration determined that stockpiling elastomeric respirators, in addition to other types of respiratory protection, may result in considerable cost savings.<br /><br />However, reusable elastomeric respirators are infrequently used in U.S. healthcare delivery, so most HCP have little or no experience with them. CDC and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) need to better understand whether and in what settings elastomeric respirators could be used in the context of patient care, especially during public health emergencies when there is an increase in demand for N95s and other RPD.<br /><br />The purpose of this initiative is to determine the feasibility and capability of U.S. healthcare delivery organizations to routinely use reusable respirators and/or rapidly convert to their use during a public health emergency. A competitive contract funding mechanism will identify and select up to three U.S. healthcare delivery organizations as partners for a series of demonstration projects and clinical studies.<br /><br />The Statement of Work includes a Base Contract and two Options (two optional tasks). Offerors may submit a proposal for (1) the Base Contract, (2) the Base Contract and Option A, (3) the Base Contract and Option B, or (4) the Base Contract, Option A, and Option B.<br /><br />The government intends to post the solicitation around the end of April.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/HHS/CDCP/CMBP/2018-N-67799/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"US","POPADDRESS":"Contractor's place of business"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0404","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Other Defense Agencies","OFFICE":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","LOCATION":"Contracts Management Office","ZIP":"22203","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"541715","OFFADD":"675 North Randolph Street <br> Arlington, VA 22203","SUBJECT":"Collection and Monitoring via Probes for Active Situational Scenarios (COMPASS)","SOLNBR":"HR001118S0022","RESPDATE":"060418","ARCHDATE":"10262018","CONTACT":"BAA Coordinator\n\n<a href=\"mailto:HR001118S0022@darpa.mil\">HR001118S0022@darpa.mil</a>","DESC":"The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative proposals for the Collection and Monitoring via Planning for Active Situational Scenarios (COMPASS) program.

The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is seeking proposals from qualified offerors to provide a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and other viral pathogens.\r\n<p>The current contract is held by Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, under contract number HHSN272201200023C. The period of performance of the current contract is September 21, 2012 through September 20, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>Description<br />The purpose of the NIAID Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) program is to provide a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and other viral pathogens, performed on samples from subjects enrolled in NIAID-sponsored multisite clinical studies. The VQA program ensures the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from NIAID-supported clinical trials and HIV natural history studies by providing laboratories with proficiency testing panels and real-time assay run controls, and analyzing proficiency panel and assay run data from each laboratory. The VQA program also implements standards of performance for existing and state-of-the-art new virologic assays, develops and tests biostatistical methods relating to the assays, and acquires, tests, stores and dispenses quality control materials and reagents. Thus, the VQA program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, assessment of treatments, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures. The VQA has been in operation since 1988 and has developed and standardized quality control procedures for approximately 25 virologic assays used in NIAID-sponsored clinical trials.</p>\r\n<p>The Contractor shall: 1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays for HIV and HIV related pathogens (including HCV, HBV, CMV, HSV, HPV, and KSHV) to assess the ability of laboratories performing virologic testing for NIAID-sponsored clinical trials (Labs) to successfully perform the assays; 2) conduct studies on the evaluation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistical methodologies for HIV and other viral coinfections; 3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents required for this program, including biohazardous materials and infectious agents; and 4) maintain a document library that supports the VQA program; 5) obtain ISO/IEC 17043 certification for Proficiency Testing Providers within one year of the contract and maintain the certification throughout the life of the contract (see http://www.a2la.org); 6) Provide administrative and technical support to support meetings and teleconferences as well as the dissemination of data; and 7) provide initial and final transition of the contract.</p>\r\n<p>The Contractor shall serve laboratories associated with current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups. Currently, the contract serves approximately 110 laboratories, with 55 international laboratories in 22 countries.</p>\r\n<p>The Government anticipates a potential need to increase the level of effort by exercising Options for the following additional support: 1) to expand the number of laboratories serviced by the Program during the period of the contract; 2) for similar services that address viral disease agents other than HIV and HIV related pathogens; and 3) to add a CLIA certified lab for late stage validation of assays for clinical testing.</p>\r\n<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, term/level of effort, type contact will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options to extend the term of the contract that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible period of performance of seven (7) years, beginning approximately June 21, 2019. The requirement will be the delivery of 9.80 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year, including consultant and subcontractor effort, for the Base Period (Year 1) and 9.80 FTEs per year, including consultant and subcontractor effort, for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include:</p>\r\n<p>Options for Increased Level of Effort for Additional Labs: During the period of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support new NIAID supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 5 Labs. These options may be exercised during Years 2 through 7. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 0.20 FTE during the first year, including consultant and subcontractor effort. If the options for these Laboratories are exercised in any year after the first year, 0.10 FTE per year, including consultant and subcontractor effort, will be needed in subsequent years. The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>\r\n<p>Options for Increased Level of Effort for Additional Expertise: During the period of the contract it may be necessary to develop a quality assessment program for assays associated with viral disease agents other than HIV and HIV-related pathogens that were not anticipated at the time of contract award, and that would directly support high priority NIAID research programs. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 3.65 FTE, including consultant and subcontractor effort, for each option exercised. One option may be exercised per year in years 2 through 7. The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>\r\n<p>Options for Increased Level of Effort for the Addition of CLIA Certified Labs: During the period of the contract, it may become necessary to use new and novel virologic assays in clinical trials where results will be used for clinical decisions within the trial. This will necessitate the use of a CLIA certified laboratory for late stage validation of the assay and for clinical testing. If necessary, this will be provided through the exercise of options to this contract. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 1.0 FTE, including consultant and subcontractor effort, for each option exercised. One option may be exercised per year in years 2 through 7. The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>\r\n<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate (AFRL/RY) includes within its mission the improvement of Air Force ISR capabilities, through both sensor device enhancements and novel processing of sensor data.  Layered sensing is an ISR asset management approach emphasizing mission success through tailored application of platforms, sensors, infrastructure, and analysis capabilities.  Of Air Force interest is the use of layered sensing principles to accommodate multi-domain information sources, to accelerate sensing and analysis, and to enable multiple forms of autonomous systems.  Such development requires basic through advanced research in sensor data processing; expertise in modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A); and software engineering and integration experience.</p>\r\n<p>Over many years the AFRL Advanced Recognition Capability (ARC) Laboratory has been involved in the assessment, demonstration, and integration of mature (Technology Readiness Level 5+) technologies supporting ISR capabilities.  These ARC roles are being expanded to accommodate promising but less-mature (Technology Readiness Level 3-4) technology, focusing their development as appropriate on Air Force missions.  The ARC includes technology that emulates certain operational ISR systems to a degree that enables advanced development and streamlined transition.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of the Sensing, Learning, Autonomy, and Knowledge Engineering (SLAKE) program is to advance Air Force sensing capabilities by employing diverse sensor processing results at a representational or product level that is abstracted from the direct sensing output yet retains crucial information and corresponding uncertainties.  Key research areas under SLAKE include development of sensor product representations suitable for efficient storage, efficient communication, and efficient resource allocation; robust conversion of sensor processing output to novel representation formats; accurate characterization of sensing uncertainties; rigorous incorporation of sensing uncertainties within novel algorithms for sensor resource management, task allocation, and information fusion; development and employment of virtual environments suitable for exercising specific algorithms and for analyzing specific system concepts; and sustained, efficient descriptions of mission context and mission operating environment.  In support of technology maturation and transition, SLAKE also includes small unmanned aerial system (SUAS) integration and operation, advanced demonstration and validation.</p>\r\n<p>SLAKE technology trajectories must be compatible with the constraints of future contested and highly contested operating environments, and with relevant missions and roles.  However, SLAKE research and development must build upon and contribute to a broad technical foundation, and as such requires deliberate experimentation that relaxes and imposes operating constraints consistent with the maturity and specific objectives of each development thread.  The majority of SLAKE efforts will require software development that incorporates modern best practices; furthermore, software development under SLAKE must be compatible with the constraints of Air Force network and computing environments.  SLAKE is expected to employ modern computing architectures and Air Force fielded systems, both of which may require procurement of specialized software and hardware as part of system development and technology transition.</p>\r\n<p>Technology investments under SLAKE are expected to be diverse, drawing upon previous and ongoing government, industry, and academic work in areas including sensor exploitation, machine learning, synthetic data generation, target tracking, information fusion, and modeling and simulation.</p>\r\n<p>The contractor shall be required to deliver all hardware, software, and associated data developed and utilized in the development of any resulting contract.  It is anticipated that a BAA providing details into this program will be released in May/June 2018; the BAA will be made available at www.fbo.gov.

As part of DMCHWD, the Healthy Tomorrows Partnership for Children grant program promotes the development and advancement of healthy communities through partnerships with organizations that work to change conditions in the community and environment to improve health through 38 grants across 22 states.</p>\r\n<p>DMCHWD working with key partners including grantees and States supports national MCH infrastructure building to improve the health of women and children through their work with professional associations, public agencies, and voluntary organizations; moreover, they constitute a ready and willing cadre of individuals with expertise, dedication and commitment to children.</p>\r\n<p>Maternal and child health (MCH) nutrition leaders and state public health nutritionists have unique and valuable knowledge in the biological and social determinants of health, life course initiatives, and links between epidemiology and public health practice, as well as the skills to execute comprehensive and effective food and nutrition programs, policies, systems, and environmental change strategies that support healthy weight. Although public health nutrition expertise is essential to addressing public health issues, including childhood obesity, the public health nutrition workforce in Title V MCH programs has slowly eroded over the last 10-15 years. This decline has resulted in an absence of public health nutrition professionals with experience in the unique needs of MCH populations able to support strategic planning and policy efforts. This trend is expected to continue as a large portion of the existent workforce is expected to retire over the next decade.</p>\r\n<p>This project: The purpose of this contract is to provide technical assistance and training to MCHB Title V Block Grant grantees on food and nutrition policy, programs, and services with a focus on bolstering the public health nutrition workforce. The participants of this TA and training will be able to better integrate nutrition in state Title V MCH programs.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the contractor shall:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;provide technical assistance to state Title V MCH nutrition programs to enhance implementation of evidence-based and evidence-informed policies and practices;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;engage Title V MCH Nutrition Professionals in collaborative learning, training, and workforce development</p>\r\n<p>&bull;assess state implementation of the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Blueprint;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;provide leadership training and technical assistance through coordination and collaboration with MCHB-supported nutrition training program grantees;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;develop resources on emerging issues in MCH nutrition; and</p>\r\n<p>&bull;develop and implement a community of practice on childhood obesity prevention in rural early childhood education (ECE) settings</p>\r\n<p>All future information regarding this acquisition, including the solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov).

The MEP National Network<sup>TM</sup> comprises NIST MEP, 51 MEP Centers located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and its 1,300 trusted advisors and experts at nearly 600 MEP service locations, providing any U.S. manufacturer with access to resources they need to succeed. MEP Centers are funded by a combination of Federal, State, local and private resources; and focus on helping small and medium-size manufacturers (SMMs)generate business results and thrive in today's technology-driven economy.</p>\r\n<p>MEP's mission is to enhance the productivity and technology performance of U.S. manufacturing by acting as a trusted, strategic advisor to promote business growth and connecting manufacturers to public and private resources essential for increased competitiveness and profitability. Centers tailor services to meet critical needs, ranging from process improvement and workforce development to specialized business practices, including supply chain integration, innovation, and technology transfer. MEP's foundation is built upon its partnerships. Centers are the hub for manufacturers, connecting them with government agencies, trade associations, universities and research laboratories, state and federal initiatives, and a host of other resources to help them grow and innovate.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, NIST's MEP has a need for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to assist MEP in successfully fulfilling their mission, as stated above. One of the principle goals of this requirement is to for the Contractor to understand the current and future development and delivery capabilities of the network. This will be accomplished by establishing mechanisms to discover the current and future needs of U.S.-based small manufacturers and translating that information into actionable strategies and plans to enhance the development, delivery and quality of products and services delivered by the Centers and foster coordination of those organizations that comprise this network. The contract will provide additional resources and subject matter expertise to expand and accelerate MEP's ability to serve as a trusted advisor for U.S. manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, strategies and plans will be developed and executed to support expansion and deeper leverage of resources to integrate cost reduction strategies with profitable growth. The successful deployment of these strategies, services and products will further enable the MEP National Network to most effectively serve as the critical connecting point for manufacturers, state and local governments, private sector resources, research organizations, and the federal government. To respond to this expanded need, MEP will, with support from this contract, develop new networks and partnerships that companies require to realize an enduring competitive position in the global market. These efforts will further promote the transition from reactive strategies to the proactive pursuit of increased profits and overall growth by helping manufacturers to understand the value of their marketable assets in light of these drivers.</p>\r\n<p>The major areas of emphasis for research, marketing and deployment of efforts under this contract shall be related to the four key goals of the MEP strategic plan:</p>\r\n<p>Empower Manufacturers: Assist U.S. manufacturers in embracing productivity-enhancing, innovative manufacturing technologies; navigating advanced technology solutions; and recruiting and retaining skilled employees.</p>\r\n<p>Champion Manufacturing: Actively promote the importance of a strong manufacturing base as key to a robust U.S. economy and protection of national security interests; create awareness of innovations in manufacturing; create enabling workforce development partnerships to build a stronger and more diverse workforce pipeline; and maximize market awareness of the MEP National Network.</p>\r\n<p>Leverage Partnerships: Leverage national, regional, state, and local partnerships to generate substantial increases in market penetration; identify mission-complementary advocates to help MEP become a recognized manufacturing resource brand; and build an expanded service delivery model to support manufacturing technology advances.</p>\r\n<p>Transform the Network: Maximize the MEP National Network's knowledge and experience to operate as an integrated national network; increase efficiency and effectiveness in employing a Learning Organization platform; and create a resilient and adaptive MEP National Network to support a resilient and adaptive U.S. manufacturing base.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the Support Contract will be a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract, with issuance of subsequent Firm Fixed Price Task Orders, as needed throughout a period of 5 years.

In 2015, working with other federal agencies through the Plant Conservation Alliance, the BLM led development of the 2015 National Seed Strategy for Rehabilitation and Restoration. This strategy provides a coordinated approach for federal and non-federal partners working toward effective ecological restoration on public, tribal, state, municipal, and private lands. The first goal of this Strategy is to identify seed needs, seed facilities and understand seed resources and capacities across both the public and private sectors to ensure reliable, commercial availability of genetically appropriate species. An assessment for the Eastern U.S. has been initiated. Conducting a westwide assessment of seed needs, facilities and the capacities of both non-federal and federal sectors is the first step towards achieving Goal 1 of the Strategy.\nScope\nIn order to identify where and how the BLM should invest, leverage and coordinate its native plant materials development efforts and to achieve the highest return for our investment, the BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration Program needs to understand the native seed needs of all land managing agencies and organizations across the western U.S., as well as the capacity of federal, state, tribal and private sectors to help meet those needs. This assessment requires (1) a careful and systematic inventory of federal, tribal and state agencies and other private land managers using native seed, (2) what species and sources are being used, (3) for those agencies/organizations using native seed- what are the current and future seed needs, (4) what federal, tribal, and private facilities/companies exist to meet this need and\n(5)\twhat is their capacity to meet this need.\n\nThis sources sought shall not be considered as a request for quote or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.\n\nBackground\nIn 2001, Congress directed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to establish a native plant material program because there were limited native seed sources in the commercial market. Since 2001, the Plant Conservation and Restoration Program has focused on increasing the availability of plant material to encourage a broader variety of species and seed sources are available for purchase from the commercial seed industry. The BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration Program is developing new native seed sources that will improve the effectiveness of federal vegetation management treatments by using seed transfer guidance to target initial seed collections for subsequent commercial seed production (seed increase) as described in the native plant materials development cycle.\nhttps://www.blm.gov/programs/natural-resources/native-plant-communities/native-seed-and-plant-mater ial-development.\nScope\nThe BLM requires the collection of between 5,000 and 2,000,000 pure live seeds (per collection) of target species in target seed transfer zones across the western U.S. Because of the inherent variability of wildland seed production due to climate and other factors, BLM cannot predict where and when seed ripening will occur on public lands.\n\nThe BLM requires both skilled botanists or plant ecologists and field crews. Accurate botanical identifications and detailed attention to implementing established protocols are critical. The skilled botanists/plant ecologists will provide training, oversight and QA/QC of field crews that will identify and scout potential populations for collection, monitor phenology of populations suitable for collection, and perform seed collections using the Bureau of Land Management Technical Protocol for the Collection, Study, and Conservation of Seeds from Native Plant Species for Seeds of Success (Attachment 1). In addition, skilled botanists/plant ecologists or field crews may be tasked with assisting BLM field staff with botanical inventories, vegetation mapping, mapping and monitoring BLM special status plant populations, monitoring revegetation/habitat restoration project success, and assisting BLM field staff with the preparation of project specific NEPA documents as described in the BLM Integrated Vegetation Management Handbook. \nhttps://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/uploads/Media_Library_BLM_Policy_Handbook_H-1740-2.pdf\n\nBLM locations where seed technicians could be stationed include: the continental US and Alaska.

Improving seed sources and restoration treatment effectiveness provides a direct benefit to the BLM by reducing the need to reseed projects, expedite revegetation/restoration goals, and allow multiple use activities to return to degraded public lands faster. To develop native species for restoration, BLM follows the Native Plant Materials Development Cycle. Unlike food crops, developing and using native plants for wildland restoration requires an investment in understanding plant ecology, seed biology, propagation and cultivation practices, as well as developing techniques for sowing seed effectively on restoration sites. This understanding is achieved by completing scientific studies and investigations (science delivery) projects for priority native plant species.\nScope\nThe BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration Program has a requirement for science delivery projects that will improve the effectiveness of federal restoration and vegetation management treatments on public lands. In particular, the BLM has a requirement for projects in four topic areas: (1) Native plant population genetics as related to local adaptation and the performance of native seed sources, including but not limited to the development of seed transfer guidance (2) Native plant interactions, ecology and biology as related to understanding and restoring ecological function, (3) Agronomic development of native plant species for commercial seed production, including but not limited to field cultivation practices and seed increase, and (4) Evaluating methodologies and improving the effectiveness of existing restoration practices and developing new restoration methodologies/treatments to restore degraded public lands. The BLM requires science delivery projects to use traditional research practices and techniques (such as but not limited to, germination studies, laboratory and field studies, common garden studies, and ecological investigations). BLM requires the science delivery projects to be compiled into publically available technical reports and peer reviewed publications. Science delivery projects shall be proposed, planned, developed and implemented by lead investigators with a PhD (or equivalent combination of education and work experience) and publication history that demonstrates the investigator has an in-depth understanding of the topic area and experience using science based strategies to answer questions important to land managers.\nThis sources sought shall not be considered as a request for quote or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

The NICHD, Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Branch, has a requirement to maintain and enhance the infrastructure resources within the Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN).</p>\r\n<p>Description</p>\r\n<p>Newborn screening programs currently screen more than 4 million U.S. infants per year. The intent of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic.  This public health program has saved countless lives through the identification of infants who are at risk for congenital disorders for which early interventions and treatments have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>\r\n<p>In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 \"core conditions\" and that 25 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations are to be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (originally authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and the Secretary of HHS. This panel now includes 34 core conditions and 26 secondary conditions that form the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening.  There has been broad acceptance of these screening guidelines by state screening laboratories, and interest in adding new tests that have been appropriately vetted to the recommended panel. In addition, under the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 and reaffirmed under the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014, the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program within NICHD is authorized to carry out, coordinate, and expand research in newborn screening.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, policies related to newborn screening are determined through analysis of the severity and incidence of each condition under consideration, the specificity and sensitivity of the screening test, the natural history of the disorder, and the efficacy, safety, and effectiveness of treatments available for the disorder.</p>\r\n<p>To date, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening.  However, research in this arena, where many of the disorders are rare diseases and states have varying rules and regulations related to newborn screening, has been challenging for investigators.</p>\r\n<p>To address this problem, the Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) was established to provide infrastructure support and scientific guidance to researchers working to:  a) Identify, develop and test promising new screening technologies; b) Increase the specificity of newborn screening;  c) Expand the number of conditions for which screening tests are available; and/or d) Develop experimental treatments and disease management strategies for additional newborn conditions, and other genetic, metabolic, hormonal and or functional conditions that can be detected through newborn screening for which treatment is not yet available.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to hold an open competition to maintain and enhance the infrastructure resources within the NBSTRN.</p>\r\n<p>NICHD intends to solicit proposals for this effort through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541715.</p>\r\n<p>Selection of an Offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors. The factors in order of importance are: (1) technical, (2) cost/price, and (3) past performance. Technical factors are significantly more important than cost/price.</p>\r\n<p>It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance consisting of a base and four option periods. Performance will begin on or about September 26, 2018, with an anticipated effort of approximately 6,566 FTEs per year.</p>\r\n<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.<br />This RFP will be available electronically on or about June 4, 2018, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>\r\n<p>No collect calls will be accepted.

The next step for human spaceflight beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is into cislunar space and destinations to planetary bodies. An important part of NASA's strategy is to stimulate the commercial space industry while leveraging those commercial capabilities through public-private partnerships and potentially through future contracts to deliver mission capabilities at lower costs. NASA's ultimate goal is to develop capabilities to enable missions that are not reliant on resupply from Earth thus making them more sustainable and affordable. NASA is implementing this by employing a capability-driven approach to its human spaceflight strategy. The approach is based on developing a suite of evolving capabilities that provide specific functions to solve exploration challenges. These investments in initial capabilities can continuously be leveraged and reused, enabling more complex operations over time and exploration of more distant solar system destinations.\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>NASA intends to issue an Appendix to the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships -2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in the near future to solicit ideas and technologies for a Trash Compaction and Processing System (TCPS).  The TCPS is part of the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Habitat's Logistics Reduction (LR), with the objective to identify and develop technologies that reduce logistical mass, volume, and the crew time dedicated to logistics management. The TCPS objectives are: (1) trash compaction to a suitable form for efficient long-endurance storage; (2) safe processing of trash to eliminate and/or reduce the risk of biological activity; (3) stabilize the trash physically, geometrically, and biologically; and (4) manage gaseous, aqueous, and particulate effluents. The TCPS will be the first step toward development and testing of a fully-integrated unit for further Exploration Missions and future space vehicles.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The objectives of this BAA appendix will implement the first of two phases. Phase A will be to develop and provide a proof of concept for a complete trash compaction and processing system with a goal to develop final requirements for a follow-on Phase B flight demonstration unit on the International Space Station (ISS). The expected outcome of Phase A efforts is a validated concept able to mature into flight demonstrations on the ISS within three years. A future follow-on BAA is planned for delivery of that ISS flight unit. Detailed submission information, participant eligibility, additional topic information and specific evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be identified in the Appendix.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>It is anticipated that the development of the desired capabilities within a singular facility will require the integration of multiple enabling technologies. Thus, partnering between industries with complementary technologies, as well as with academic research units, will result in the most competitive proposals and is strongly encouraged.</div>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/147a524de393aec7d4a1cc4bc8d85ce0","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0524","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","OFFICE":"Headquarters","LOCATION":"HQ Code 210.H","ZIP":"20771","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"54171","OFFADD":"NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA Headquarters Acquisition Branch, Code 210.H Greenbelt MD 20771","SUBJECT":"Partnerships for Commercial Optical Communication Systems","SOLNBR":"NASA-PCOCS-03","RESPDATE":"060119","CONTACT":"Dr. Hossin Abdeldayem, Senior Technology Transfer Manager , Phone 301-286-8682, Fax 301-286-0301, Email hossin.abdeldayem@nasa.gov - Enidia Santiago-Arce, Senior Technology Transfer Manager, Phone 301-286-8497, Fax 301-286-0301, Email enidia.santiago-arce-1@nasa.gov","DESC":"In pursuit of the National Space Policy's goals and NASA's strategic plan, NASA is continuing its efforts to foster the development of new industrial space-related capabilities that will lead to education and job growth in science and engineering and spur economic growth as capabilities for new space markets are created.

The institutes construct allows for the participation of experts from a wide range of fields and organizations in a single distributed research structure, enabling greater progress and benefit for all involved. The institutes approach facilitates a more focused and coordinated set of research and development efforts than typically arise from separate solicitations and individual research grants. In addition, because the institute maintains this focus for several years, more effective and substantial research progress is envisioned for the featured high priority research areas. An awarded institute will typically be 5 years in duration and up to $15M total over the 5-year period.  Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals; teaming with other universities is required, and teaming with non-profit entities and industry is permitted.  See Appendix section 3.0 for full list of eligibility requirements.  The award instrument will be a grant.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The Appendix exclusively seeks proposals that are responsive to one of the following two topics:&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>Revolutionary Propulsion for Rapid Deep Space Transit<br />Smart Deep Space Habitats (SmartHabs)</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The financial and programmatic support for STRI comes from the Space Technology Research Grants Program within the Space Technology Mission Directorate.

In addition, an interested organization should have the capacity to perform in vitro predictive toxicology assays. Specifically, the project requires the following tasks to be performed: <br /><br />Task 1: Receptor Profile Screening (screening a compound at approximately 64 sites) Task 2: Receptor Binding Affinity and/or Functional Activity, (Computing IC50/Ki at sites showing activity in the profile screening or other sites of interest to NIDA); Task 3: Predictive Toxicology and Pharmacokinetic Testing (Cyp450, hERG channel, genotoxicity (Ames test). Task 4: Assay Development (interested organizations may be asked from time to time to submit a proposal to develop an assay not in their current catalog). <br /><br />This is a follow-on procurement to Contract Number HHSN271201300025C titled \"Receptor Profiling and Predictive Toxicology.\" NIDA anticipates the award of a single indefinite delivery, indefinitely quantity (IDIQ) task order contract for a period of performance of five years. NIDA may award either cost reimbursement and/or fixed price task orders under this contract. NIDA anticipates that at least one task order will be awarded with the contract.<br /><br />Many of the compounds that will be tested will come from private sources (e.g., the pharmaceutical industry) that wish to keep information and data confidential (e.g. until patents are filed). In most cases, NIDA will have signed a confidentiality agreement with the provider indicating that the data obtained will not be released without the provider's written permission. For this reason, the Contractor may not publish, present, or otherwise disclose the results of studies on test compounds unless the NIDA Contracting Officer grants written permission to publish or otherwise disclose this information.<br /><br />MANDATORY CRITERIA<br />Due to the nature of the compounds which will be evaluated under this contract, it is mandatory that offerors possess a DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V in order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 at the time of submission of the proposal. In addition, the successful offeror must either possess, or demonstrate the ability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule 1 controlled substances prior to awarding the contract. <br /><br />NOTICE<br />RFP No. NIHDA201800068 will be available electronically on or about 15 days from the date of this posting. You can access the RFP through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://fedbizopps.gov) or through the NIDA website (URL: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract-proposals-rfps). All information required for the submission of a proposal will be contained in or accessible through the RFP package. Responses to the RFP will be due 30 days from the release date. NIDA anticipates an award on or before August 15, 2018. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. <br /><br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.

Proposed research that complements current CAN-2 Institute Teams, and/or addresses important research areas not currently covered in the Institute, will be given strong consideration (see: <strong>http://sservi.nasa.gov/sserviteams</strong>).</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The research scope for this CAN is in the fields of lunar, NEA, and martian moon studies, with preference given to topics that emphasize studies related to the Moon and those that relate to joint interests of SMD and HEOMD. The proposed research should address NASA's basic (science) and applied (exploration) research goals and should include multidisciplinary investigations that address the objectives of this CAN. The proposed research should be integrated; thus, proposals consisting of tasks addressing multifaceted questions must demonstrate significant scientific and/or technical connections among the tasks. Proposals that only address a single question should strive to integrate interdisciplinary expertise and methodologies. It is expected that teams bring together expertise from more than a single institution.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>This CAN will support the broad spectrum of lunar, NEA, and Martian moon studies encompassing investigations of the surface, interior, exosphere, genesis, evolution, and the near-space environments of these bodies. Investigations that link science and exploration are highly encouraged. Fundamental research having clear, critical and longer-term implications for acquiring or interpreting data regarding potential human destinations is encouraged (for example, addressing Target Body Strategic Knowledge Gaps), as are research efforts that are relevant to (but are not dependent upon) current or future space missions. Proposals in the areas of astrophysics and heliophysics that are enabled through human and robotic exploration of the Target Bodies are also solicited through this Cooperative Agreement Notice. Efforts to develop new technological approaches to scientific exploration of Target Body(s), are encouraged, including but not limited to telerobotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. Supported investigations include, but are not limited to, theoretical investigations, numerical modeling of physical or chemical processes, experimental/laboratory investigations, development of technical/technological approaches, and field studies.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The full text for this draft CAN may be downloaded as PDF file from <strong>the NSPIRES page for NNH18ZDA013J</strong>, which may be reached by following the link embedded in the text or by or by searching on NNH18ZDA013J at <strong>http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/open</strong>.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>Comments on the draft text are due by COB July 3, 2018, via email to<strong> HQ-SSERVI@mail.nasa.gov</strong>.</div>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/d1b3d4822672bf8aa7be7731e9689056","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0314","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Health and Human Services","OFFICE":"National Institutes of Health","LOCATION":"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development","ZIP":"20892-7510","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"541715","OFFADD":"Contracts Management Branch\r\n6710B Rockledge Dr., Suite 1124, MSC7000 Bethesda MD 20892-7510","SUBJECT":"National Children�s Study (NCS) Biological and Environmental Sample Repository","SOLNBR":"NIH-NICHD-OD-2018-4C","CONTACT":"Jacquelin M.

The desired status at the end of this procurement action is completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial and an approved Phase 3 clinical study plan, both under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.</p>\r\n<p>Hearing is a critical sense for Service Members (SMs).&nbsp; The inherently noise-hazardous environments common to military service make SMs particularly vulnerable to the vast subset of sensorineural hearing loss known as NIHL.&nbsp; Hearing injuries can threaten safety and fitness for duty by impeding communication, reducing situational awareness, hindering threat detection, and ultimately degrading mission effectiveness.&nbsp; In some cases, hearing loss may preclude redeployment or result in less optimal job assignment, and may permanently reduce their quality of life.</p>\r\n<p>There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacological prevention strategies for NIHL.&nbsp; Several non-pharmacological strategies are available but these cannot alone, nor in concert, fully eliminate hearing loss.&nbsp; Strategies employed by the Department of Defense (DoD) include: noise-control engineering, hearing protective devices (HPDs), and administrative controls to limit times of exposure.&nbsp; Current US Military protocols for post-exposure treatment of acute acoustic trauma (AAT) include removing the patient from the noise hazard and maintaining the patient in an effectively quiet environment (ambient levels 70 dB or less) for twenty-one (21) days.&nbsp; Noise isolation provides some recovery from AAT, but removes SMs from duty for prolonged periods.</p>\r\n<p>The long term goal of the TIRM PMO is to make wounded warfighters whole by restoring form, function, and appearance.&nbsp; The outcome of this development will enable TIRM PMO to lead the development of products that will treat wounded warriors with NIHL in operational environments.</p>\r\n<p>According to PINIHL Integrated Product Team (IPT) market research, the developmental phases of these pharmacological interventions with potential to protect from or mitigate NIHL currently range from preclinical to start of Phase 2 clinical studies.&nbsp;

The primary objective of this Appendix to the NextSTEP-2 BAA is to enable rapid development and flight demonstrations of medium- to large-scale lunar landers by supporting critical technology advancement and leveraging component- or system-level industry investments. Each flight demonstration will validate lander evolutions of increasing capability and design extensibility to ensure a viable path toward reusable, human-class lunar landers.\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<p>An important part of NASA's strategy is to stimulate the U.S. space industry while leveraging those same commercial capabilities through partnerships and future contracts to deliver mission capabilities. A key component of the NextSTEP-2 partnership model is that it provides an opportunity for NASA and industry to partner in the development of capabilities that meet NASA human space exploration objectives while also supporting industry commercialization plans for expanding the frontiers of future economic opportunities in space.</p>\r\n<p>This BAA Appendix addresses the development of medium- to large-scale lunar lander capabilities that have extensibility to reusable, human-class landers to a wide range of destinations on the lunar surface.  NASA is planning two demonstration missions; one in 2022 and a second in 2024. The objective of these missions is to demonstrate progressive and evolutionary steps toward a reusable, human-class lander, with future missions informed by the outcomes of these initial missions. The first mission will serve as a National Lander Demonstration Mission with NASA serving as the overall system architect and integrator with significant industry participation from multiple sources.</p>\r\n<p>This NextSTEP-2 Appendix E, targeted for release in the early July 2018 timeframe, will include a NASA reference lander configuration to serve as the basis of the Lander for a first flight demonstration by the end of calendar year (CY) 2022. NASA will support critical technology advancement by leveraging industry investments in the design and development of this first medium-size Lander. Contracts awarded under Appendix E will have multiple phases.  The first will be for brief studies to refine the reference design lander; these are anticipated to be brief with succinct products to assist in the development of the lander mission for flight in 2022. Appendix E will also seek identification of enabling, currently available (or nearly available), critical technologies (such as precision landing) to be integrated into the reference lander design.

Content is defined as the computer generated visualizations for use in a VAM device. This information may be spatially registered to the physical environment or may be similar to a \"billboard\" of information or task list. A user would be totally immersed in (virtual) a training use case, or computer generated content could be overlaid onto real world views (augmented or mixed).  Cost effective solutions for VAM content creation are needed across the Air Force enterprise. The sheer magnitude of aircraft preventive and remedial maintenance tasks will require innovative crowd sourcing of AR  content development by airmen. The content must be able to be developed by non-programmers, and not be dependent on digital models of legacy aircraft systems</p>\r\n<p>(2)  Content Approval and Management. Development of solutions for vetting and managing VAM content are also needed. Ensuring that the latest technical data is used by airmen is just as critical when using VAM as other more traditional media. Methods and processes to vet VAM content will be critical in the application of this technology across the Air Force enterprise.</p>\r\n<p>(3) Open Modular Enterprise Solutions. With many potential use cases for VAM, the types of AR devices the Air Force will need is anticipated to be varied. A risk assessment will need to be done for each use case and the device deemed safest for that application should be selected. This includes physical safety of the maintainer and cybersecurity for Air Force computer networks and data. Any solution should be device agnostic and allow for the adsorption of new technical capabilities as they enter the market.</p>\r\n<p>(4) VAM Business Case.

Specific expertise and experience required includes, but is not limited to training development support, training delivery support, management of a training program, general administrative, office and conference center support.</p>\r\n<p>Established by Congress in 1970, the National Highway Institute (NHI) is the training and education arm of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). NHI's mission is to provide technical transportation training and associated materials to the surface transportation community. Since 2004, NHI has been authorized by the International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET) to award Continuing Education Units (CEU) to participants who successfully complete selected NHI training courses.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"tab-stops: 4.5pt\">Traditionally, the NHI offered instructor-led training (ILT) within a classroom setting. Sensitive to the time and travel constraints of customers and aware of advances in a wide array of instructional technologies, NHI has dramatically expanded their distance learning offerings. These include Web-Based Training (WBT), Web Conference Training (WCT), Videoconference training (VCT), flipped classroom training, blended learning, new technologies such as mobile apps and virtual world delivery, and new evolving training delivery platforms. NHI also develops and updates supplemental materials and services to support training, advance the state of practice and implement best practices. NHI charges external participants for many of its training courses and materials.</p>\r\n<p style=\"tab-stops: 4.5pt\">In addition, NHI provides specialized training and development services internally to FHWA, although NHI is not responsible for all aspects of employee development and training. Today, NHI administers memberships with industry associations on behalf of the agency. NHI also provides instructional systems design expertise, resources and programs to enhance the instructional skills and capabilities of FHWA employees, and, in some cases, will assist other FHWA offices with development of training that is not delivered through NHI. Finally, NHI identifies, tests, pilots and implements new tools and technologies to support learning.</p>\r\n<p style=\"tab-stops: 4.5pt\">NHI delivers its training courses based primarily on demand from customers, thus the number of training sessions delivered is variable and unknown in advance. The NHI website (<a href=\"http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/\">http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/</a>) provides a listing of current training courses, as well as information on training philosophy, instructor standards, and the NHI Style Guide. In 2016, NHI delivered classroom-based instructor-led training to 15,301 participants; web-conference training to 32,437 participants, and supported registrations of 47,854 participants in its web-based trainings. NHI participation has shown a consistent growth trend since at least 2006, with much of the growth resulting from web-based trainings. Instructor led training sessions have had generally steady participation and session ordering during this time with some year-by-year variation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The NAICS code for this requirement is 541611.

Fisher, Phone 843-760-3356, Fax 843-760-3356, Email lisa.fisher@ati.org","DESC":"<br />The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">pre-announcement</span></strong> for an upcoming&nbsp;Request for Project Proposals (RPP) focused on conducting assessments to understand the psychological or physiological effects of augmented reality (AR) medical simulations that may impact learning effectiveness in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to identify psychological and physiological limitations of AR medical simulation training in the diverse high pressure and stressful context anticipated in the various military echelons of care, which will help ensure optimal development and utilization of AR technology to address the identified capability gaps in military medical simulation training.<br />&nbsp;\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Technology Focus Areas</span></strong><br />AR is the use of a computer-based simulation engine to add non-real sensory information to the real sensory world. Essentially, AR directs participants' attention to either existing information that they would have not been consciously aware of or to new information that changes their perceptual information. Although this co-registered information can be visually projected directly onto real objects, AR information is often presented directly to the recipient by a device attached to the recipient.</p>\r\n<p>\"Assessment of the Psychological and Physiological Effects of Augmented Reality\" or APPEAR maps to DHA's Joint Evacuation and Transport Simulation (JETS) and Point of Injury and Trauma Simulation (POINTS) programs, under the JPC-1/MSIS Medical Simulation portfolio. It addresses the capability gaps in the Virtual Patient System (VPS) of JETS and POINTS. The VPS provides intelligent, scalable, modular medical training products, tools, and devices across globally distributed, integrated, and interconnected Live, Virtual, Constructive, and Gaming training environments. Technology using AR is a significant piece of the VPS, at point of injury (POINTS) and point of demand across the complete chain of evacuation (JETS). <br />After release of the Request for Project Proposals (RPP), Offerors will be allowed to submit more than one solution brief. Solution briefs will be expected to address the following (subject to change):<br /><br />&bull; Propose a human study that focuses on one of the following:<br />o Psychological effects of AR on the end user in training behavior (secondary assessments of cognitive load during learning using AR and/or assessment of neuropsychiatric conditions contraindicated for training with AR could be included), or <br />o Physiological effects of AR on the end user in training behavior (secondary assessments of cognitive load during learning using AR and/or assessment of physical conditions contraindicated for training with AR could be included).<br />&bull; Justification for targeting psychological or physiological effects of AR, including ability of team to address that focus area;<br />&bull; Propose the assessment of AR prototypes currently under development or in use for military medical simulation training; and<br />&bull; Provide detailed information regarding the type of AR and specific scenarios that will be involved in the clinical assessments.<br /><br />Under the forthcoming RPP, the requested work will be separated into two tasks.<br /><br />&bull; Task 1 includes all planning tasks for the human subjects study, including but not limited to, IRB/HRPO approvals or exemptions, hiring study staff, development of the clinical study protocol, and coordination with collaborators (if required). Task 1 will have a maximum period of performance of 6 months. An administrative review will be conducted after the completion of Task 1 to assess performance and approve continuation of the project onto Task 2.<br />&bull; Task 2 includes execution of the human subjects study. Task 2 will have a maximum period of performance of 18 months.<br /><br />Proposed studies are not limited to a specific medical domain and all areas of medicine are encouraged for submission (i.e., dental, dermatology, obstetrics, ophthalmology, and surgical fields); however, medical domains that have higher alignment with (or must have at least one demonstrated tool with traumatic/multi-casualty) treatment of traumatic and acute injuries/multi-casualty are preferential.<br /><br />This upcoming RPP is not interested in the procedural or therapeutic use of AR, nor is it interested in the routinization of actions, i.e., the automatic performance of an integrated set of actions. It is concerned with the effects of AR on participants' cognitive, affective, and physical states. It is anticipated that the outcome of Tasks 1 and 2 will achieve at least one of the following (not in rank order):<br /><br />&bull; Complete a human study that evaluates the physiological or psychological effects of AR, and/or assesses cognitive load, and/or determines conditions that would contraindicate AR exposure.<br />&bull; Enable efficiency in the design of future AR scenarios/prototypes in medical simulations.<br />&bull; Identify potential safety issues that should be accounted for in AR prototypes used in medical simulation training. <br />&bull; Provide recommendations and/or proposed mitigation strategies regarding any safety issues identified to improve or refine development of or existing AR prototypes.<br />&bull; It is anticipated that AR scenarios assessed will be relevant across the military and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and potential academic, clinics, rural healthcare settings, private and public hospitals, and international healthcare situations.<br />&bull; If applicable, support safety data in investigational device exemption or 510(k) applications or provide post-mark surveillance data for FDA-cleared AR technology.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Potential Funding Availability</span></strong><br />The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently has available a minimum of $2.5 Million (M) for this effort. A period of performance no greater than 24 months is expected, and faster timelines are acceptable.</p>\r\n<p>It is expected that MTEC will make at least two awards of $1.25M each to a qualified team to accomplish all tasks. Up to four awards may be made, contingent on the availability of additional funds.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Acquisition Strategy:</span></strong><br />The MTEC will use a streamlined, accelerated approach for this acquisition. This approach will consist of the following steps:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 1:</span> MTEC members who wish to offer a solution to the RPP must submit a Solutions Brief. The Solutions Brief will contain the MTEC Offeror's technical concept and approach along with their viability toward the specific effort. To meet the statutory requirement of the Other Transaction authority, Offeror Solutions Briefs will also have to address the significant participation of a Nontraditional Defense Contractor or Nonprofit Research Organization on the team or the willingness to provide 1/3 cost share to the project. The Offeror will also be expected to present a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 2:</span> As part of the Government review of the Solutions Brief, MTEC members who have submitted a favorable Solutions Brief based on the RPP criteria may be invited to present and discuss their solution with the Government sponsors for the research via a virtual or in-person \"pitch\" of the proposed project along with a SOW/Milestone Payment Schedule and cost information.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 3:</span> MTEC Offeror(s) will be notified of the down select recommendation(s), and if selected, will be invited to submit a detailed Cost Proposal in accordance with the MTEC Proposal Preparation Guide (PPG).</p>\r\n<p>Because of the nature of the requirements set forth in the forthcoming RPP, this streamlined, interactive approach is anticipated to be a better means to highlight company methodologies and skills and allow the government to gain a fuller appreciation of the work required to be completed. It provides more freedom and initiative to the Offeror to describe how they would approach and solve such an action. The full description of this contracting approach will be included in the upcoming RPP.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">MTEC:</span></strong><br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, \"nontraditional\" government contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Administrative Information:</span></strong><br />The RPP will be posted to the MTEC website and a summary notice will be posted on FedBizOpps.gov to notify interested parties.

Over the past 7 years, NASA ARC has partnered with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a number of activities focused on the development of small / medium satellites, satellite systems and subsystems, assembly integration and test, mission assurance, mission design, responsive manufacturing, ground operations, and launch services - often employing innovative approaches in order to accelerate acquisition timelines. Several of these capabilities are currently being met through a suite of contracts, awarded in 2010, under a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract titled \"Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW)\" and a multiple award IDIQ contract titled \"Modular Space Vehicle (MSV)\". The SSPEDI acquisition is envisioned to serve as a follow-on to the RRSW and MSV contracts in the continued pursuit of innovative and affordable approaches through basic research, applied research, and advanced development focused on, but not limited to, payloads, buses (i.e. spacecraft subsystems such as life support; attitude control; guidance, navigation and control; command and data handling; communications system and antennas; power; thermal control; propulsion; and structures and trusses), ground systems / infrastructure and launch systems.

In support of this mission, DARPA has pioneered groundbreaking research and development (R&amp;D) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for more than five decades. Today, DARPA continues to lead innovation in AI research through a large, diverse portfolio of fundamental and applied R&amp;D AI programs aimed at shaping a future for AI technology where machines may serve as trusted and collaborative partners in solving problems of importance to national security. The AI Exploration (AIE) program is one key element of DARPA's broader AI investment strategy that will help ensure the U.S. maintains a technological advantage in this critical area.\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>Past DARPA AI investments facilitated the advancement of \"first wave\" (rule based) and \"second wave\" (statistical learning based) AI technologies. DARPA-funded R&amp;D enabled some of the first successes in AI, such as expert systems and search, and more recently has advanced machine learning algorithms and hardware. DARPA is now interested in researching and developing \"third wave\" AI theory and applications that address the limitations of first and second wave technologies.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The pace of discovery in AI science and technology is accelerating worldwide. AIE will enable DARPA to fund pioneering AI research to discover new areas where R&amp;D programs awarded through this new approach may be able to advance the state of the art. AIE will enable DARPA to go from idea inception to exploration in fewer than 90 days.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>To enable this approach, DARPA will issue AIE Opportunities. These AIE Opportunities will focus on technical domains important to DARPA's goals in pursuing disruptive third wave AI research concepts.

</span>In 2017, GSS vendors collected nearly $2 billion in consular fees, prior to scheduling more than 10 million appointments and delivering over nine million documents.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;\">GSS delivers a globally integrated and fully auditable solution of six distinct, yet critically inter-connected, categories of service: information, appointment scheduling, consular collection in a variety of methods to include local currency, delivery of issued travel documentation, onsite &ldquo;greeters&rdquo; who verify applicants appearing for their appointments and handle crowd management, and offsite biometric collection in certain countries.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>The collection of consular fees, which funds the overwhelming majority of CA&rsquo;s consular operations, is a critical component to this contract.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;

</span>Subsequently, DoS awarded twenty-three (23) individual task orders, with follow-on task orders competed and awarded as well.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>CA&rsquo;s need for GSS services will continue into the foreseeable future, and DoS will contract these services under the subject of this acquisition, GSS 2.0.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;

The Government is seeking industry comment and questions on the Performance Work Statement (PWS).\nBACKGROUND\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Office of Transition and Economic Impact (TEI) is seeking contractor services for support of the Military's Transition Assistance Program (TAP).  TEI requires support with advancing the ongoing implementation; sustainment and enhancement of TAP to ensure Servicemembers and their families have the necessary tools and information to seamlessly transition into civilian life.  \nEach day Servicemembers make the transition from the military to civilian life.  To aid in that transition, in August 2011, President Obama directed the Department of Defense (DoD) and VA to lead a task force with the White House economic and domestic policy teams and other agencies to develop the first major redesign of TAP.  At the direction of the President, the purpose of the redesigned TAP is to develop a new training and service delivery model to allow a Servicemember, which includes Active, Reserve, and Guard, regardless of their branch of Service, to depart \"career ready\".  In addition to the Presidential Task Force efforts, Congress passed the Veterans Opportunity to Work to Hire Heroes Act (VOW Act 2011) which mandates all Servicemembers who are separating, retiring, or being released from a period of 180 days or more of continuous Active Duty must complete all mandatory requirements of the VOW Act, which includes pre-separation counseling to develop an Individual Transition Plan (ITP) with DoD and identify their career planning needs; attend the VA Benefits Briefings I and II to understand what VA benefits the Servicemember earned, how to apply for them, and leverage them for a positive economic outcome; and attend the Department of Labor Employment Workshop (DOLEW), which focuses on the mechanics of resume writing, networking, job search skills, interview skills, and labor market research.\nTo support the development of VA TAP career readiness programs, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) TEI requires the assistance of subject matter experts (SMEs) with extensive experience in the development and implementation of education, skills and career training for transitioning employees.  TEI requires a team that is capable of supporting and improving an existing model for transitioning Servicemembers, Veterans, and their families from the military to a productive civilian life.\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this contract is to provide TEI with support services to address VOW Act requirements, support continuous implementation of the interagency Veterans Employment Initiative (VEI) Task Force recommendations, the Transition Goals, Plans, Success (GPS) curriculum, Capstone events and the Military Life Cycle (MLC) model. \nCONTRACT TYPE\nThe contract type will be a hybrid contract type, a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) and Time and Material, covering a 5 year period of performance, inclusive of options \nNAICS\nThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s) for this requirement is 541612, Human Resources Consulting Services, which has a size standard of $15 Million.

The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) intent to negotiate a modification to its existing USA Learning (USAL) Knowledge Portal contract with Powertrain, Inc., OPM2615D0001, to increase the overall ceiling value of the contract by $180,000,000 to a total of $290,000,000.\r\n<p>The Government intends to negotiate the ceiling increase solely with Powertrain, Inc. per FAR 6.302-1, as no other source of supplies or services will currently satisfy agency requirements. The current vendor provides services through the referenced Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The IDIQ is currently in Option Year three (March 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019). There is one option year remaining to be exercised which will result in an ultimate contract expiration date of February 27, 2020. Due to extraordinary growth of demand for e-learning services and the pending DoD IT reform initiative, OPM must increase the current contract ceiling of the IDIQ. OPM is currently developing its requirements for a new competed contract to replace the existing IDIQ; however, due to its complexity and criticality, OPM does not believe the new requirement can be fully developed and the new contract can be awarded and operational prior to the ultimate expiration of the existing contract. As such, OPM will require an increase to the ceiling of the existing contract to sustain support of multiple agencies through its expiration. OPM estimates that it will need to increase the value of its existing contract by $180,000,000 to meet ongoing needs through the remainder of the contract term. This estimate is based on historical data, an analysis of business growth, extraordinary expansion of the e-learning market, and the increased popularity of the shared service provider model. The contractor providing services for this requirement must be at a minimum FedRAMP Moderate (DoD IL2) for all existing applications and environments.</p>\r\n<p>The Government's decision not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Enterprise Network & Internal Private Cloud - This topic will seek to\r develop a\r prototype for the a) creation of an enterprise network to link multiple,\r independent &\r geographically separate work centers together with a multi-site, multi-tenant\r internal\r private cloud that utilizes Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies to\r automate\r network operations, minimizing required manpower to operate the network; b)\r provide\r seamless workload mobility between work centers and for the ability of a user\r at one\r work center to utilize computing resources at another work center and internet\r access at\r another work center; and c) creation of a two-location global network\r operations center\r (NOC) that will operate & maintain the enterprise network/private cloud.\r 5. Network and Data Security  This topic will look to receive prototypes that\r provide\r network and security measures that are for safeguarding Covered Defense\r Information\r (CDI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) held by contractors and\r incident\r reporting.  The desired prototype will address the need for industry to meet or\r exceed\r current federal requirements to safeguard CDI and CUI, report adverse security\r incidents\r and for government assurance of contractor and sub-contractor compliance\r without\r unnecessary increase in cost or oversight.\r Note that in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2371b(f), and upon a determination that\r any of\r the prototype project(s) for this transaction has been successfully completed,\r this\r competitively awarded prototype(s) OTA may result in the award of a follow-on\r production contract(s) or transaction(s) without the use of competitive\r procedures.\r Details concerning potential follow-on production is included in the RPP, its\r attachments,\r and its related Statements of Work.\r For more information concerning IWRP, please refer to the attached Frequently\r Asked\r Questions (FAQ) sheet.\r To register for the IWRP Consortium Industry Day, please use the following\r link:\r https://events.bizzabo.com/209677\r Additional information on IWRP and instructions on how to become a member can\r be\r found at TheIWRP.org.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/c330cfbf457e72942e17df4f8a999a63","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"lisa.rosenbaum@navy.mil","DESC3":"Contract Specialist","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0807","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of the Interior","OFFICE":"U.

Snyder, Contract Specialist, Phone 7034323153, Email teri.snyder@usmc.mil","DESC":"This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a Request for Quotation (RFQ); it is strictly a Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3 for planning purposes only. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.\r\n<p>BACKGROUND:<br />United States Marine Corps Training and Education Command (TECOM) Range and Training Area Management (RTAM), Army, Navy, and Air Force, requires technical support for the RMTK and Marine Corps Range and Training Area Management Systems (MCRTAMS) including provisions of the RMTK tools approved for Foreign Military Sales customers. The RMTK and Marine Corps Range and Training Area Management Systems (MCRTAMS) support is provided for unit commanders, headquarters staffs, operating units, range managers, cross-service users, and international customers in a desktop, web, and mobile environment. The RMTK is provided as a set of range safety standard metrics that relates range capabilities to specific training requirements using established range safety standards. RMTK on MCRTAMS provides access to and supports the RMTK for safety, range use, range planning, and range support functions as MCRTAMS stores and provides Geographic Information System (GIS) data for Marine Corps ranges and training areas in addition to other non-Marine Corps areas where the Marine Corps regularly trains. MCRTAMS also provides the Marine Corps' integrated and readily available range inventory and training range database in a web environment.</p>\r\n<p>The RMTK is a suite of tools that is a software application that currently runs as an Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) ArcMap Extension utilizing ESRI 3D Analyst and Spatial Analyst extensions, ARC Server for the web enabled portions of MCRTAMS and in a Xamarin framework for the mobile environment. The danger zone tools within RMTK depict a three dimensional (3D) area associated with firing weapons/lasers/explosives where the risk of damage, injury or death does not exceed an acceptable level. The RMTK danger zone tools allow the user to create and modify danger zones. The danger zones encompass the ground and airspace for lateral and vertical containment of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components resulting from the firing, launching, and/or detonation of ordnance. This three-dimensional zone accounts for weapon accuracy, failures, ricochets, and broaches/porpoising of a specific weapon/munition type delivered by a specific aircraft type, laser energy and direct/indirect fire weapons ordnance. Danger Zones represent the minimum safety requirements designed for live fire training on Department of Defense (DOD) training ranges.<br />The Marine Corps is the lead and Chair of the Aviation Range Safety Sub-Group as designated by the DOD's Cross Service Range Use Standardization Working Group (RUSWG), RTAM is tasked to develop comprehensive strategies accommodating the differing Service and National perspectives, and varying needs for range utilization and safety, and shall be the basis of the WDZ tool/data in addition to Service considerations in the remainder of the RMTK tools. Specifically, the Weapons Danger Zone (WDZ) tool is the accepted United States Service air to ground danger zone tool for all air to ground activities to provide weapons danger zones and risk analysis. The RMTK tools will be provided upon request and approval to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other Partners for Peace (PfP) nations to facilitate interoperability. However, any new danger zone requests or access to a RMTK tool from a Foreign Ally will be reviewed by the US Government then directed to Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) Foreign Disclosure Branch for coordination.</p>\r\n<p>RTAM is responsible for establishing a cohesive management framework that ensures the objectives of the various sponsored initiatives are executed within program constraints. This includes establishing a cohesive management organization and support framework to execute management of business and technical attributes of program initiatives, oversight of prime vendor performance (e.g., progress, investment), and coordinating actions among Integrated Product Teams (IPT) and other participating activities (i.e.: NATO Range Safety Working Group, International Range Safety Working Group).</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, for the WDZ tool data cubes consist of the data necessary to determine the initial impact distribution (Delivery Accuracy), the ricochet impact distribution, and the failure mode impact distribution. These data are used to generate a combined probability distribution function (pdf) that defines the potential impacts from a training range event. While the term \"Data Cube\" is applied to the various subcomponents of the WDZ weapon model, the actual data cube is comprised of both organized multi-dimensional look-up tables (created in Microsoft Access) that sample a weapon's physical performance data and coefficient terms describing a polynomial approximation to a physical characteristic specific to the weapon's unique behavior. This interpolated data is integral to the data cube though various software interfaces and that data are used as a data point within the data cube. Weapon systems that have similar ballistic and failure mode characteristics use the same data and modeling format.<br /><br />The RMTK suite of tools are created in VB.Net and C++ and Xamarin. The User Interface tools are written using VB.Net and the RMTK engine is compiled into a C++ Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The database foundations of the tools are created in Microsoft Access and Microsoft SQL Server. The RMTK mobile tools will be developed and maintained for use in an iOS and Android. For the WDZ tool the WDZ Software Specification Documents Volume I-VI provide detailed technical information regarding the WDZ tool required to create and integrate the WDZ data cubes.</p>\r\n<p>PURPOSE OF THE RFI:<br />RTAM and DOD range managers require software maintenance, database development, engineering support, integration services, functionality and range safety parameter updates within the Multi-Service RMTK suite of tools, RMTK integration services and functionality updates within the MCRTAMS and the integration of ETR, SDZ, and WDZ into a mobile environment. Services in support of this effort shall require information to be provided by Subject Matter Expert(s) (SMEs) that are knowledgeable of air to ground and ground to ground weapons, munitions properties and aircraft systems properties and how the munitions interact with the aircraft, the delivery systems combined with effects on the range in either a ground to ground or air to ground training activity. In addition, SMEs are required to advance the Government's knowledge and understanding and SMEs are to interpret the probabilistic variances of all aspects of weapons and aircraft for inclusion in the RMTK suite of tools. SMEs are required to integrate complex mathematical formulas into a GIS extension/interface that is compliant with Marine Corps Order (MCO) 3570.1C, Range Safety and MCO 3550.12, Operational Range Clearance, doctrines. The information provided by SMEs shall support the Government in the development of danger zones for inclusion in the tools as outlined below.</p>\r\n<p>RESPONSES:</p>\r\n<p>Response Format -Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper in Microsoft Word for Office 2010 compatible format.

This goal has two distinct parts.  The first is reducing the complexity that airmen must endure as a result of the myriad of complex systems of systems used in order to create multi-domain plans and subsequent orders.  The desired effect of this reduction in complexity is the reduction of uncertainty in planning operations and an associated increase in operations ops tempo.  The second part of this goal is the imposition of complexity on an adversary that comes with developing synchronized and orchestrated effects through the use of assets from multiple domains.  For this BAA we will focus on the operational domains of air, space and cyberspace, but will consider innovative approaches that may include land and maritime.  A major class of approaches to this management of complexity will involve the use of machine learning algorithms.</p>\r\n<p>BAA ESTIMATED FUNDING:  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $9,999,999.00.

Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>\r\n<p>1. Title: Writing and Editing Services for Protocol Summaries, Protocol Consents and Scientific Manuscript<br />2. Background Information: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution which comprises 27 institutes and centers. The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is the 200-bed clinical research hospital where the institutes and centers carry out early-phase clinical research studies in Bethesda, Maryland.<br />The CC is the setting for the NIH intramural clinical research program. Research participants are admitted to the CC or seen in its outpatient clinics for the sole purpose of participating in clinical research trials. The CC admits patients from all over the world for clinical trials and natural history studies. The CC accommodates about 10,000 new patients and 100,000 outpatient visits a year. There are about 1,600 clinical research protocols in progress.</p>\r\n<p>3. Purpose or Objective: The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 stipulates that information about all NIH-funded clinical trials must be on an accessible online database and they must be written in understandable lay language. To comply with this legislation, the CC has a requirement for a contractor with extensive experience and demonstrated skill in (1) editing complex protocol documents into plain language that can be easily understood by the general public; (2) using plain language standards to write summaries of complex protocol documents that are easily understood by the general public; and (3) editing scientific manuscripts from NIH scientists and investigators for medical and scientific journals or for lay publications.</p>\r\n<p>4. Period of Performance: A base period of one year beginning on or around 09/27/2018 and four option periods of one year.</p>\r\n<p>CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS (SCOPE OF WORK)<br />Independently and not as an agent of the Government, Contractor will furnish all necessary services, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform all tasks in this requirement. All work under this requirement will be monitored and technically coordinated by employee(s) of the CC Office of Protocol Services or the Office of Communications and Media Relations. The majority of the work will be performed remotely at the Contractor's site.<br />Specific Tasks<br />1. The contractor will produce approximately 200 protocol summaries and lay titles in plain, lay language annually according to requirements below. The summaries and lay titles will be drawn from final and approved protocol and consent documents provided by the CC. <br />2. The contractor will edit protocol consent documents into easily understandable lay language according to requirements below. <br />3. The contractor will edit scientific manuscripts from NIH scientists and investigators for scientific and lay audiences as needed. <br />4. The contractor will not maintain copies in any format of government documents after finished work has been accepted by the government.<br />Under this contract, it is expected that 90% of the work will involve writing protocol summaries. About 10% of the work will involve editing free-standing consent documents and/or scientific manuscripts.<br />The summaries, lay titles, protocols and their associated consent documents will be transferred from NIH to vendor and returned by vendor to NIH using the CC's FTP mechanism. Other documents will be transferred in Microsoft Word format via email or in hard copy via mail.<br />Protocol summaries/lay titles will be completed and returned by the contractor within three (3) business days after the contractor receives the original documents. Final documents will be delivered during weekdays only to the vendor and to the government. A document's length and complexity may affect turnaround times, and if additional time is needed to complete writing and editing, the contractor must notify the CC within one (1) business day of receipt and agree to an alternative delivery timeframe, not to exceed six (6) business days. <br />The lay title for protocol summaries is limited to 300 characters including spaces and the summary to 5000 characters, including spaces.<br />The contractor must proofread all written and edited documents so that documents contain no errors such as, grammatical errors, or typos. A CC subject matter expert will review documents before final distribution. If the above errors are found on more than three (3) documents a month, this contract will be terminated. <br />The contractor must determine and follow specific style guides for writing and editing.<br />Reading level for protocol summaries and consents will be at an 8th grade level. The contractor will assess reading level by using a commonly accepted tool, typically the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score associated with Microsoft Word.<br />The protocol summaries must not include certain symbols. Text alternatives that the contractor will use are: <br />Tabs<br />Accents <br />&beta;=beta sign<br />a=alpha sign<br />&gamma;=Gamma sign<br />&zeta;=Zeta sign<br />&bull; Bullets<br />@ at sign<br />&amp; and <br />&copy;<br />&le; less than or equal to<br />&ge; greater than or equal to<br />&micro;= micro<br />&dagger;= cross<br />&ordm; = Degree<br />Subscripts<br />Superscripts<br />Na&#970;ve - replace &#970; with i <br />Backward E = possible existent</p>\r\n<p>The following symbols should not be used in the lay title:<br />&amp; ampersand<br />{ open bracket<br />} close bracket<br />| pipe<br />+ plus sign<br />&plusmn; plus and minus<br />With or without<br />More or less<br />%Percentage<br />~ guiggle<br />^ hat<br />\\ backslash<br />.. chains =</p>\r\n<p>General quality measures, as set forth below, will be applied to each work product received from the contractor.</p>\r\n<p>Accuracy: Work Products shall be accurate in presentation, technical content, and adherence to accepted elements of style.<br />Clarity: Work Products shall be clear, concise, and relevant.<br />Consistency to Requirements: All work products must satisfy the requirements below.<br />File Editing: All text and diagrammatic files shall be editable by the Government.<br />Format: Work Products shall be submitted in hard copy (where applicable) and in media mutually agreed upon prior to submission. Hard copy formats shall follow any specified instructions.<br />Timelines: Work Products shall be submitted on or before the due date specified or submitted in accordance with a later scheduled date determined by the Government.</p>\r\n<p>The government will review, for completeness, preliminary or draft documentation that the contractor submits, and may return it to contractor for correction. Absence of any comments by the Project Officer will not relieve the contractor of the responsibility for complying with the requirements of this work statement. The contractor shall not construe any letter of acknowledgment of receipt material as a waiver of review, or as an acknowledgment that the material is in conformance with this work statement. Any approval given during preparation of the documentation, or approval for shipment shall not guarantee the final acceptance of the completed documentation.</p>\r\n<p>Contractor Qualifications<br />The contractor will have the following qualifications:<br />&bull; Demonstrated experience writing protocol summaries and lay titles for Internet posting on clinicaltrials.gov and editing protocol consent documents<br />&bull; Extensive experience writing and editing about complex medical topics<br />&bull; Extensive experience editing materials written by clinical researchers<br />&bull; At a minimum, degree in English, journalism, health communications or a closely related field<br />&bull; Demonstrated ability to follow plain language guidelines as outlined under \"Clear Communications: An NIH Health Literacy Initiative,\" <br />http://www.nih.gov/clearcommunication/plainlanguage.htm<br />&bull; Demonstrated ability to write and edit documents that meet requirements for posting on the National Library of Medicine's clinicaltrials.gov website, http://clinicaltrials.gov/</p>\r\n<p>Government responsibilities<br />The CC will:<br />&bull; Provide final documents for the contractor to summarize or to edit.<br />&bull; Specify FTP instructions<br />&bull; Approve any extensions to established deadlines for all work products<br />&bull; Detail any special requirements for work products</p>\r\n<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables/ Contractor will:<br />&bull; Provide a list of all products produced, time spent on each product itemized by charges for completion. This deliverable is required monthly as an attachment to the invoice.<br />&bull; Receive and return work products in the manner specified in this contract<br />&bull; Produce materials according to timelines established in this contract</p>\r\n<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements<br />&bull; Work will be accepted only if it meets requirements and timelines established in this contract.<br />&bull; A subject matter expert will review documents before final distribution.</p>\r\n<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</p>\r\n<p>Protocol summaries and consents are critical to NIH Clinical Center's research mission and the skill set to develop these documents is highly specialized. These documents translate highly technical language into a format understandable to the general public, particularly patients who enroll in clinical studies at the NIH. A break in service would negatively affect recruitment of patient partners in research. This project is a continuation of a current award. The incumbent vendor is Vector Technical Resources, Inc. The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research.</p>\r\n<p><br />CLOSING STATEMENT</p>\r\n<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.

With the ultimate goal of creating an \"AIDS-Free Generation,\" the division develops and supports the infrastructure and biomedical research needed to: 1) halt the spread of HIV through the development of an effective vaccine and biomedical prevention strategies that are safe and desirable; 2) develop novel approaches for the treatment and cure of HIV infection; 3) treat and/or prevent HIV co-infections and co-morbidities of greatest significance; and 4) partner with scientific and community stakeholders to efficiently implement effective interventions.\r\n<p>NIAID places the highest priority on ensuring the safety and optimal management of individuals who participate in its clinical trials and on obtaining reliable laboratory-based data critical for the meaningful interpretation of study findings. Equally important is the safety of those who perform the laboratory testing.</p>\r\n<p>NIAID aims to achieve comparability between U.S. (licensed labs) and non-U.S. generated study results. The purpose of this contract for Patient Safety Monitoring in International Laboratories (SMILE) is to enhance the ability of current and future mostly non-U.S. laboratories participating in NIAID-supported clinical trials to perform tests in accordance with good clinical laboratory practice standards and produce reliable test results. SMILE will continue to serve current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups), as well as individual grantees conducting clinical research.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>The purpose of this contract is to provide a comprehensive and uniform approach to evaluate initial and on-going laboratory capability and readiness to carry out NIAID-funded clinical trial protocols by: (1) monitoring laboratories' compliance with good clinical laboratory practice standards, (2) monitoring the quality and reliability of Protocol-specified laboratory test results, (3) providing laboratories with various means of assistance, guidance and training to address and prevent recurrence of deficiencies in compliance with good clinical laboratory performance standards and/or proficiency testing, and (4) hosting and maintaining the existing electronic data management system.</p>\r\n<p>The current Patient Safety Monitoring in International Laboratories (SMILE) contract was awarded to Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD on November 15, 2012, for a period of seven years (includes all term options). Currently, SMILE supports approximately 170 non-U.S. laboratories in 15 countries. SMILE will continue to support laboratories that are part of current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/hivaids-clinical-trials-networks).</p>\r\n<p>The Government anticipates a potential need to: (1) expand the number of laboratories serviced by SMILE during the course of the contract, and (2) enhance existing computer software systems in order to accommodate documents, similar to those managed by SMILE, received from other NIAID laboratory-supporting contracts. Increases in effort for these services would be implemented through the exercise of contract options, at the discretion of the Government.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project Requirements:<br /></strong>Offerors should have the qualifications, experience and capability to perform this requirement. Specifically, the Contractor will be responsible for the following:</p>\r\n<p>1. Reviewing laboratory audit reports to identify deficiencies in good clinical laboratory practices and providing laboratories with guidance for corrective action.</p>\r\n<p>2. Monitoring laboratories ability to accurately and reliably perform Protocol-specified tests used to diagnose viral, fungal, bacterial and parasitic infections, hematology and blood chemistry assays, liver function tests, and drug resistance assays. The contractor must have experience in reviewing and interpreting proficiency testing reports from providers such as the College of American Pathologists.</p>\r\n<p>3. Providing assistance, guidance and training on procedures and Standard Operating Procedures related to laboratory qualify management, instrument and test validation, specimen management, data management, equipment maintenance, personnel safety, test QA/QC. The contractor must have experience with creating and utilizing training tools and must have staff able to travel to various laboratories outside the U.S. to provide training.</p>\r\n<p>4. Maintaining and hosting an existing SMILE computerized data management system and document library to track and make available documents in support of activities performed under the contract. Further enhancement of the system may be necessary. The contractor must have the ability to maintain the computerized system security documentation as required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong><br />It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contact will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period), plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about August 15, 2019. The requirement will be the delivery of 13.7 full time equivalents (FTEs) for the base period (Year 1) and 13.7 FTEs per year for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7). The number of FTEs includes the effort of subcontractors, but does not include the effort of consultants.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, to the functions and services to be provided for the Base period, the Government may exercise quantity Option(s) for additional level of effort, in order to accommodate unanticipated increases in demand. These Options are defined as follows:</p>\r\n<p>Options 7 through 27: Increased Level of Effort for Additional Labs:<br />During the course of the contract, it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support new NIAID clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities, to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an Option. Each Option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 10 Labs, and the Option will be maintained for the life of the contract. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 1.10 FTEs. The number of FTEs includes the effort of subcontractors, but does not include the effort of consultants. One Option for adding new Labs may be exercised once per year during any year of the contract, beginning with Year 2, for a total of 21 Options during the life of the contract, as follows: Year 2 (Option 7), Year 3 (Options 8 and 9), Year 4 (Options 10, 11, and 12), Year 5 (Options 13, 14, 15, and 16), Year 6 (Options 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21), and Year 7 (Options 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27). The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>\r\n<p>Options 28 through 34: Increased Level of Effort for Additional Electronic Data Management System and Document Library Services:<br />During the course of the contract, additional specialized expertise may be needed to enhance existing computer software systems in order to accommodate documents, similar to those managed by SMILE, received from other NIAID laboratory-supporting contracts. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 0.75 FTE with expertise in software development and support. The number of FTEs includes the effort of subcontractors, but does not include the effort of consultants.

These systems currently support DoD flying, ground, sea and technical training, as well as current and future systems (prototyping, proof of concept, low rate production) which are either already in service or destined to support client agency activities.</p>\r\n<p>The products range from simple classroom training aids to static trainers with moving parts, no power requirements, to powered mockup procedures trainers and other flight, ground and technical training devices, which replicate actual system operation and are able to respond to instructor induced malfunctions and student inputs.</p>\r\n<p>The 502 TDS also provides notable engineering services and support for DoD Multi-Platform Simulation/Training Devices and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs, including the procurement, fabrication, integration, testing, and delivery of intermediate-level test and simulation equipment and ancillary equipment.</p>\r\n<p>The 502 TDS tailors trainers for its intended purpose and the 502 TDS routinely uses low-cost, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), and/or military specification parts that have a proven reliability and availability.</p>\r\n<p>The primary place of performance for development and integration will be at the Contractor's facilities. However, installation and testing may be on site at multiple Government locations in CONUS and OCONUS. Specific places of performance will be defined in each of the individual task orders.</p>\r\n<p>This information in this announcement serves as the pre-solicitation notice. Solicitation number is ID07180011. This is a non-personal, commercial services requirement. The multiple award IDIQ will consist of a five (5) year ordering period. Performance is expected to begin March 12, 2019. Actual performance start and end dates will be specified on the contract line item structure at time of award. The applicable NAICS is 541512. To be eligible for award, the contractor shall have this NAICS on their sam.gov registration. The size standard associated with NAICS 541512 is $27.5M, which means that a company, including its affiliates, would be considered a \"small business\" if their average annual earnings does not exceed $27.5M for each of the pay periods for the preceding completed twelve (12) calendar months. The Product Service Code is R425.</p>\r\n<p>This requirement is being competed on an unrestricted basis and will be evaluated under a two phase process. The Phase One Request for Proposal (RFP) is tentatively scheduled to be released on or about September 21, 2018 and will remain open for 30 days. Successful offerors in Phase One will be invited to participate in Phase Two. All interested offerors must submit and upload Phase One proposals to GSA's IT-Solutions Shop (ITSS) web-based order processing system. Phase Two proposals, if invited to participate, shall be uploaded into GSA's ITSS web-based order processing system as well. Interested offerors must register in ITSS. The ITSS Help Desk number is 1-877-472-4877. ITSS webpage is https://web.itss.gsa.gov/Login. Before submitting a Phase One proposal for consideration, all interested offerors must send GSA an email identifying (1) offeror's name, and (2) the name of an individual employee who will act as the offeror's GSA point of contact (POC) for this requirement that is \"registered in ITSS.\" OFFERORS MUST IDENTIFY THE COMPANY NAME AND THE POC'S NAME EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS IN ITSS. \"Registered in ITSS\" or \"Registration in ITSS\" means an offeror is successfully registered in ITSS such that the Government can select the offeror's designated POC in ITSS to receive the RFP, view an order, and be able to submit a proposal. Some offerors have multiple company divisions and employees registered in ITSS making it difficult for GSA selection. Therefore, to ensure that all interested offerors have successfully registered in ITSS and are able to submit a Phase One proposal, submission of the above ITSS offeror information (offeror's name and POC) is required five (5) business days prior to Phase One RFP closing date . An email must be sent to erin.quinn-neuendorf@gsa.gov.</p>\r\n<p>The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date, and there shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government, to include liability for contractor's proposal costs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/b670de232a73c564ed677ccde453ae58","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0906","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Transportation","OFFICE":"Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)","LOCATION":"W.J.

A user would be totally immersed in (virtual) a training use case, or computer generated content could be overlaid onto real world views (augmented or mixed).  Cost effective solutions for VAM content creation are needed across the Air Force enterprise.

The content must be able to be developed by non-programmers, and not be dependent on digital models of legacy aircraft systems</p>\r\n<p>(2)  Content Approval and Management. Development of solutions for vetting and managing VAM content are also needed. Ensuring that the latest technical data is used by airmen is just as critical when using VAM as other more traditional media. Methods and processes to vet VAM content will be critical in the application of this technology across the Air Force enterprise.</p>\r\n<p>(3) Open Modular Enterprise Solutions. With many potential use cases for VAM, the types of AR devices the Air Force will need is anticipated to be varied. A risk assessment will need to be done for each use case and the device deemed safest for that application should be selected. This includes physical safety of the maintainer and cybersecurity for Air Force computer networks and data. Any solution should be device agnostic and allow for the adsorption of new technical capabilities as they enter the market.</p>\r\n<p>(4) VAM Business Case.

Special emphasis is placed on the development and implementation of interprofessional, family-centered, community-based and culturally competent systems of care across the entire life course with experiences in one life stage shaping health in later stages. DMCHWD supports programs established in federal legislation (Title V of the Social Security Act and the Autism CARES Act) to complement state and local health agency efforts. In partnership with state MCH programs, academic institutions, and professional organizations, DMCHWD collaborates with other health training programs of the federal government to ensure that MCH initiatives are based on emerging and evidence-based practices. In Fiscal Year 2015, DMCHWD awarded 152 grants, an investment of $47 million. Grants are awarded to develop trainees for leadership roles in the areas of MCH teaching, research, clinical practice, public health administration and policy making, and community-based programs. As part of DMCHWD, the Healthy Tomorrows Partnership for Children grant program promotes the development and advancement of healthy communities through partnerships with organizations that work to change conditions in the community and environment to improve health through 38 grants across 22 states.</p>\r\n<p>DMCHWD working with key partners including grantees and States supports national MCH infrastructure building to improve the health of women and children through their work with professional associations, public agencies, and voluntary organizations; moreover, they constitute a ready and willing cadre of individuals with expertise, dedication and commitment to children.</p>\r\n<p>Maternal and child health (MCH) nutrition leaders and state public health nutritionists have unique and valuable knowledge in the biological and social determinants of health, life course initiatives, and links between epidemiology and public health practice, as well as the skills to execute comprehensive and effective food and nutrition programs, policies, systems, and environmental change strategies that support healthy weight. Although public health nutrition expertise is essential to addressing public health issues, including childhood obesity, the public health nutrition workforce in Title V MCH programs has slowly eroded over the last 10-15 years.

The infectious diseases and immune mediated diseases communities have become a data-intense enterprise and a priority for NIAID is to transform this data into knowledge to understand the pathogenesis, transmission, evolution of the pathogen, pathogen-host interactions and the host response to infectious diseases and inform the development of new and improved diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. NIAID has invested in bioinformatics and data science for data generated by NIAID intramural and extramural communities and has expanded its activities in data management systems, bioinformatics resource centers and data repositories/knowledgebases that have provided the broad scientific community with user friendly access to open data and analytical tools.</p>\r\n<p>Since their inception in 2004, NIAID's BRCs have focused on supporting and providing genome sequence databases and annotation of microbial organisms. These BRCs have provided the infectious disease research community with publicly accessible systems that store, update, integrate and display genome sequence data and its annotation, functional genomics and other \"omics\" data, and other associated data and information for a large variety of human pathogens and vectors of human pathogens and related microbial species and strains. The BRC systems allow users to query and analyze this data. As a result, the BRCs have become the public repository and primary resource for data and tools generated by NIAID supported programs and other publicly accessible data for the infectious disease research community.</p>\r\n<p>The objective of this solicitation is to continue support for the BRCs to provide data-driven, production-level sustainable computational platform(s) that enable sharing and access to usable and re-usable data, portable computational tools and standards that support interoperability for the infectious diseases research community. Through this effort NIAID will continue to provide bioinformatics services and training to support large-scale, system level diverse data integration and modeling, and enable predictive biology for pathogens and host-pathogen interactions that will accelerate discovery research, clinical investigation, and therapeutic development for infectious diseases. In addition, the platform infrastructure is expected to serve as a model for future NIAID systems. A change from the previous competition should be noted: up to two (2) BRCs will be awarded with one (1) contract awarded for bacterial species and viral families and one (1) contract awarded for protozoan species, fungi and invertebrate vectors of human pathogens. Offerors may propose to one or both data resources for the group of organisms. Funding under the prior solicitation is NOT required for submission to this solicitation.</p>\r\n<p>It is anticipated that two (2) cost-reimbursement plus fixed-fee, level-of-effort, type contracts will be awarded with a one-year base period of performance beginning on or around September 1, 2019. Awards are expected to include four (4) one-year option periods. The total period of performance, including options, is five (5) years. The Government's base level-of-effort requirement is estimated at 43,680 direct labor hours for each contract period, equating to 21 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) with an FTE being defined as 2,080 direct labor hours. In addition to the base level-of-effort, each contract period shall contain an option quantity for up to nine (9) additional FTEs.</p>\r\n<p>The NIAID recognizes that a single organization or institution may not have the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in the Statement of Work.

The objective of this upcoming RPP will be to provide a solution that reduces time commitment, minimizes travel, eliminates inconvenience, and enables practitioners not specialized in behavioral sleep intervention to provide treatment.\r\n<p>MTEC:<br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, \"non-traditional\" government contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Background:<br />Sleep management is a high priority of the military to optimize Warfighter performance, remain safe, and potentially, reduce the likelihood of psychological issues downstream. Personnel with sleep deprivation are likely to perform at a suboptimal state, both mentally and physically, which jeopardizes themselves, their companions, the mission, and the general effectiveness of the military unit. <br />According to the National Sleep Foundation, \"85% of active duty Service members have been diagnosed with a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or insomnia.\" Studies have also shown that up to 40% of returning personnel have sleep disorders that can lead to depression and anxiety, as well as contribute to other medical disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. <br />Currently, behavioral sleep interventions are recommended as the first-line of treatment of such sleep disorders, such as relaxation training, stimulus control therapy, sleep hygiene, etc., and many have shown improvements in patient outcomes in the clinic. However, the success of many of these therapies is limited due to: i) an insufficient number of clinicians and sleep clinics specializing in behavioral sleep interventions; ii) a large number of patients seeking treatment (high demand, low supply), and iii) a current practice that relies on multiple visits of face-to-face sessions with the clinician to reach an acceptable patient outcome. The time commitment, travel, inconvenience and general lack of trained practitioners contributes to the limited accessibility of these valuable interventions and leaves many patients with untreated sleep disorders.<br /><br />Project Objective:<br />This RPP will focus on the transition of evidenced-based behavioral sleep interventions for application to the military population to address the limitations of current practices. Therefore, a solution is required that reduces time commitment, minimizes travel, eliminates inconvenience, and enables practitioners not specialized in behavioral sleep intervention to provide treatment.

Burn injuries are rarely isolated events; typically there is some type of associated trauma along with a burn injury, thus inclusion of trauma bed resources is desirable. There is only one military Burn Unit, the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) in San Antonio, TX. While able to expand capacity in the event of a mass casualty event, and depending on the geographic area(s) involved in an event, bed capacity could soon be overwhelmed. The ability to maximize efficiency and effectiveness of triage and subsequent care would be critical to the management of an overwhelming surge in burn patient volume and intensity. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop, test and research a cloud-based, mobile app-accessible and operated, open architecture-based IT system to improve the logistics of burn patient/trauma patient triage and transfer in and between participating military and civilian treatment facilities in the event of a war, disaster, nuclear or other mass casualty with large numbers of burn patients.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Requirements<br />The Military Health System (MHS) seeks to leverage best practices and emerging technologies/trends by partnering with a broad array of already-engaged and leading edge industry and academic experts in the identification, development, testing and research of leading edge, open source platforms, services, data and tools that will:<br />&bull; increase agility in delivering current and future capabilities both to the military and for U.S. civilian disaster management for determining burn/trauma bed/treatment availability;<br />&bull; employ private industry tools and best practices to create an agile, mobile, easy-to-use, intuitively operated system/app;<br />&bull; capitalize upon best practices and lessons learned by Government, industry, and academia; <br />&bull; attract and engage experts in a team approach to improve military burn/trauma care management for bed assignments and practices;<br />&bull; maximize and apply innovation to Defense Burn/Trauma response; and <br />&bull; demonstrate opportunities for enhanced support, greater reliability, and efficiency at every stage of the medical transfer process for burn/trauma casualties.</p>\r\n<p>It is the goal of the proposed effort to streamline the transfer and management process using the latest technology, such as a mobile \"app,\" for the burn/trauma bed status and burn/trauma bed availability for the American Burn Association (ABA)-verified Burn Centers with automatic upload into a database available to an Armed Services Medical Regulator (ASMRO)-like individual acting as the central military transportation clearing authority, as well as other stakeholders, such as the participating Burn Centers/Trauma Centers/Department of Homeland Security/National Disaster Management System and local/state/national Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Coordinating system(s).</p>\r\n<p>The research is expected to be conducted in two phases over a 2 year period of time as follows:<br />&bull; Phase 1 (6 months): The specific aims of Phase 1 are (1) to conduct a comparative study of similar/existing and/or relevant commercial applications, data management and predictive analytic tools and capabilities as well as relevant clinical capacity/resourcing applications, and (2) conduct a requirements definition process in support of the development of a Burn Patient Transfer System (BPTS). <br />&bull; Phase 2 (18 months): The specific aim of Phase 2 is to develop a prototype/model application of an open-source, mobile, android-based BPTS.</p>\r\n<p>Potential Funding Availability<br />The U.S. Government (USG) currently has available approximately $1.93 million (M) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. This is inclusive of funds that will be provided to the USAISR and the United States Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) for military consultation throughout the period of performance. Funding amounts to these organizations are TBD, and will be handled separately. Military consultation funds will reduce the total available amount to the performer.</p>\r\n<p>MTEC anticipates that a single award will be made to a qualified team composed of teaming arrangements demonstrated to achieve the aims of this RPP.</p>\r\n<p>The Period of Performance (POP) is not to exceed 24 months.</p>\r\n<p>Acquisition Approach<br />This RPP will be conducted using a two-staged approach. In Stage 1, current MTEC members are invited to submit White Papers using the format contained in the RPP. The Government will evaluate White Papers submitted and will select one or more White Paper(s) that best meet their current technology priorities using the criteria specified in the RPP. Offerors whose technology solution is selected for further consideration based on White Paper evaluation will be invited to submit a full proposal in Stage 2. Notification letters will contain specific Stage 2 proposal submission requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Other Information<br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and supporting effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations.

No response is required at this time.\r\n<p>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this pre-announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) entitled, \"Volumetric muscle loss (VML) repair following extremity trauma.\" The goal of this research is to develop an off-the-shelf biologic prototype capable of preventing, mitigating or treating traumatic large-volume muscle loss (VML) injuries of the extremities. While such injuries are devastating, irreversible, and uniformly associated with long term disability, recent advances in regenerative medicine have made new approaches possible. The Government seeks to assess the potential for repurposing products already commercially available or in clinical development for related indications, such as critical limb ischemia, iatrogenic muscle injuries, Duchene's muscular dystrophy, compartment syndrome, and severe sports medicine injuries. Products capable of regenerating or repairing multiple tissue types or creating a therapeutic wound environment will also be considered.<br />MTEC:<br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and supporting effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, \"non-traditional\" government contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Background:<br />The exact incidence of VML following combat trauma is unknown and has not been rigorously assessed. Estimates from civilian trauma indicate that ~250,000 open fractures occur per year in the US, and these commonly involve a component of VML injury. In the military, a study of battlefield injuries in 14,500 Service members evacuated from OEF/OIF from 2001-2013 suggests high VML incidence. Approximately 77% had musculoskeletal injuries and many had open soft tissue extremity wounds. Roughly 8% of all medically evacuated patients received a disability rating specifically for VML injury. The estimated life-time disability cost per patient is $340,000-440,000 in addition to medical costs and lost wages.</p>\r\n<p>Recovery is uniformly poor, leading to significant long term disability, and leading to increased rates of delayed amputation of technically salvageable, but functionally deficient limbs. There is no agreed upon standard of care for this condition, and no clinically available therapy that can address the loss of function for this condition. The current standard of care for VML involves the use of free muscle transfer (i.e., muscle flaps) for bone coverage followed by extensive physical rehabilitation. However, most muscle flap procedures are not intended to restore muscle function except in limited circumstances. Functional muscle transfer including vasculature and innervation have been shown to improve strength to an injured muscle group. However, such procedures require a level of surgical expertise available only in limited, specialized centers.</p>\r\n<p>It is unlikely that there will be a single solution for VML repair. Interventions will likely be required along the continuum of care, beginning close to the point of injury or during initial damage control surgery. In the course of market research, multiple products have been identified which may potentially prevent additional muscle loss and stimulate a repair response early in the course of injury. Such products may be highly valuable in a prolonged field care situation. Such interventions may offer significant improvements over currently limited treatment options.</p>\r\n<p>Work Plan:<br />The focus of this RPP is to develop an advanced prototype of an off-the-shelf biologic capable of preventing, mitigating or treating traumatic large-volume muscle loss (VML) injuries along the continuum of care. The prototype must be able to repair injured muscle tissue to a degree suitable for extremity repair and reconstruction.</p>\r\n<p>The work is expected to be conducted in two phases over a 5 year period of performance as follows.</p>\r\n<p>Phase 1 (up to 2 years): An existing FDA-regulated commercial or clinical investigational product will be repurposed for VML and tested in one or more well-controlled animal bridging studies. The repurposed product must be an existing product (at a minimum of TRL 7) with demonstrated clinical benefit for at least one related skeletal muscle disorder indication, where at least one successful FDA-regulated Phase 2 clinical trial has been completed. In addition, the product should have a plausible mechanism for benefit in VML injuries. Studies will progress logically based on outcomes through go/no-go decisions after each study has achieved appropriate objectives. Product(s) will first be tested in a small proof of concept study in a rodent model. If successful, a large animal model will be used for confirmation. The optimal timing of the intervention may also be evaluated in one or more appropriate models.</p>\r\n<p>Phase 2 Optional Follow-on work (up to 3 years): If preclinical development studies are successful, the Awardee may be offered an optional extension to conduct a small proof-of-concept clinical trial in VML-injured patients. Further negotiations will be conducted between the Awardee, MTEC, and the Government if proceeding to a clinical trial becomes feasible.</p>\r\n<p>Financial Framework: <br />The U.S. Government (USG) currently has available approximately $2 million (M) for Fiscal Years (FY), FY18, FY19, and FY20 to fund Phase 1. It is possible that additional funds of at least $2.5M for FY21 and FY22 may become available for the continuation of this project through Phase 2.<br />MTEC anticipates that a single award will be made.</p>\r\n<p>The Period of Performance (POP) is 24 months for Phase 1, and an additional 36 months for Phase 2 if milestones/deliverables are achieved in Phase 1.<br />Administrative Information:<br />The RPP will be posted to the MTEC website (mtec-sc.org) and a summary notice will be posted to FedBizOpps (fbo.gov) to notify interested parties.

NATO ACT will conduct a pilot study by incorporating computing<br />power and tools in the research, trend analysis and scenario<br />development parts of its methodology in the development of SFA<br />reports. This pilot study encompasses three different but<br />interrelated tasks:<br /><br />1. Task 1: Research/Large Data Ingest Tool(s): Contractor is expected to reach out and access different web pages and other data sources that are identified by the requirements holder. Should contractor identify any additional data sources, those will be coordinated with the requirements holder. The use of commercial sources of information will be coordinated with the requirements holder to avoid duplicate<br />payments. Data sources will be aligned with the SFA themes: Political-Human-Technology-Economics/Resources -Environment.<br />Contractor will use a much larger data set and data analytics to extract data from multiple sources. In this context, a wide variety of reports and media/social media sources will be included. Crowd sourcing techniques will also be used as part of data collection and verification. The tool(s) should enable machine learning as data collection continues. The contractor will be responsible for the storage of the collected data. This data will not be shared with any other entity without authorization of the HQ SACT.<br /><br />The data derived from multiple sources as an outcome of search will be stored, indexed, cleaned and be ready for further analysis. Data will categorised and classified to allow the analyst access without any restrictions. The data will be structured in a common and usable format. It must also be possible to reliably automate structuring and formating conversions. The origin and source of the data should be available to COTR to make sure sources are known so that credibility and reliability can be evaluated. The contractor will provide insights on how data is collected, categorised, cleaned, verified and validated.<br /><br />2. Task 2: Trend Analysis Tool(s): The contractor will use prepared data to further analyse trends, cause and effect relations and cluster trends to reduce the number of trends to a comprehensible level by the analysts. In order to analyse trends, contractor will install/allow use of tool(s). Contractor will provide descriptive analytic tools, such as mind maps, to visualize the data and provide insights on the evolution and trajectory of the trends. Contractor will also provide tools for trend management and support for development of the reports that will provide insights on the trends and their associated implications.<br /><br />3. Task 3. Scenario Development Tool(s): Based on the outcome of research, Contractor will provide a scenario development tool(s) that will be used to gain further insights, inform and/or validate trends and implications. The scenario tool(s) should allow &lsquo;what if' analysis for exploration of certain hypotheses. As a result, scenario analysis tool(s) will increase the ability to provide in-depth analysis of different situations and to identify indicators, trends and associated defence and security implications.Please read entire Notice of Intent for requirement.<br /><br />Issue Date: 13 November 2018, (target date)<br />Bid Closing Date: 03 January 2019, (target date)<br /><br />Type of Contract: Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Deliverables Contract.<br />Period of Performance: 20 January 2019 (Estimated) - 31 October 2019 (Estimated)<br /><br />","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/SACLANT/SACLANTHQ/NOI-IFIB-ACT-SACT-18-75/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"US","POPZIP":"23551","POPADDRESS":"NATO/SACT HQ, 7857 Blandy Road, Suite 100\nNorfolk, VA"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"1012","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Other Defense Agencies","OFFICE":"Virginia Contracting Activity","LOCATION":"Virginia Contracting Activity - PAFB, Florida","ZIP":"32925-3002","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"541611","OFFADD":"1030 South Highway A1A\r\nBuilding 989 MS1000 Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002","SUBJECT":"EXPLOITATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS II (EMS II)","SOLNBR":"HHM402-19-R-0001","RESPDATE":"102218","CONTACT":"Contracting_Officers@dodiis.mil Contracting_Officers@dodiis.mil, Email Contracting_Officers@dodiis.mil","DESC":"<p>See attached Request for Information (RFI) for instructions for small businesses to submit capability statements.

Additionally, global actors, both state and non-state, are using the same interactive internet system to plan and coordinate activities across the spectrum of operations. Essentially, the internet has become a ubiquitous Command and Control (C2) and sensor system that impacts the United States (US) and its allies' missions around the globe, including Shaping activities, force protection, counter-terrorism, counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), and a myriad of others. <br /><br />In response, the Government has established the Secure Unclassified Network (SUNet): an off-Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN), For Official Use Only (FOUO)-accredited unclassified platform to enable the Department of Defense (DoD), US Government Interagency, and Coalition Partners to securely collaborate and share Publicly Available Information, FOUO data, analytics, and other enterprise services. This platform enables mission partners to establish virtual enclaves, control access to those enclaves, and to acquire, develop, and deploy mission-specific data sets and analytics that can be shared across multiple enclaves or restricted based on mission requirements.<br /><br />The objective of this effort is to manage, develop, enhance, integrate, test, deploy, and maintain the SUNet system infrastructure, as well as develop and implement SUNet enclaves for mission-specific requirements utilizing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) products with new data and collaboration features across US Government and foreign partner communities of interest.

The deliverables of the SFA Pilot Study will be in two parts: the first, a report on how political trends will evolve over the next two decades and shape the future security context; the second, a report on the lessons learned using computing power in development of the SFA research, trend analysis and scenario development.</p>\r\n<p>NATO ACT will conduct a pilot study by incorporating computing power and tools in the research, trend analysis, and scenario development parts of its methodology in the development of SFA reports. This pilot study encompasses three different but interrelated tasks:</p>\r\n<p>Task 1: Research/Large Data Ingest Tool(s): Contractor is expected to reach out and access different web pages and other data sources that are identified by the requirements holder. Should contractor identify any additional data sources, those will be coordinated with the requirements holder. The use of commercial sources of information will be coordinated with the requirements holder to avoid duplicate payments. Data sources will be aligned with the SFA themes: Political-Human-Technology-Economics/Resources-Environment.</p>\r\n<p>The contractor will use a much larger data set and data analytics to extract data from multiple sources. In this context, a wide variety of reports and media/social media sources will be included. Crowd sourcing techniques will also be used as part of data collection and verification. The tool(s) should enable machine learning as data collection continues. The contractor will be responsible for the storage of the collected data. This data will not be shared with any other entity without authorization of&nbsp;HQ SACT.</p>\r\n<p>The data derived from multiple sources as an outcome of search will be stored, indexed, cleaned, and be ready for further analysis. Data will categorized and classified to allow the analyst access without any restrictions. The data will be structured in a common and usable format. It must also be possible to reliably automate structuring and formatting conversions. The origin and source of the data should be available to COTR to make sure sources are known so that credibility and reliability can be evaluated. The contractor will provide insights on how data is collected, categorized, cleaned, verified, and validated.</p>\r\n<p>Task 2: Trend Analysis Tool(s): The contractor will use prepared data to further analyze trends, cause and effect relations and cluster trends to reduce the number of trends to a comprehensible level by the analysts. In order to analyze trends, the contractor will install/allow use of tool(s). The contractor will provide descriptive analytic tools, such as mind maps, to visualize the data and provide insights on the evolution and trajectory of the trends. the&nbsp; contractor will also provide tools for trend management and support for development of the reports that will provide insights on the trends and their associated implications.</p>\r\n<p>Task 3. Scenario Development Tool(s): Based on the outcome of research, the contractor will provide a scenario development tool(s) that will be used to gain further insights, inform and/or validate trends and implications. The scenario tool(s) should allow &lsquo;what if' analysis for exploration of certain hypotheses.

The existing KP-WA cohort already includes much of the required data captured over a similar time period (stage I and II invasive breast cancers diagnosed years 1990-2008, followed-up through August 2011) as the DCEG Cohort, making it an efficient and cost-effective addition to the DCEG Study, with the benefit of additional second cancer cases. The current procurement will: 1) retrieve physical radiotherapy summaries and radiation treatment plans for all exposed women with breast cancer diagnosed 1990-2008 with stage I, II or III disease, 2) expand the cohort to include stage III, and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) breast cancers diagnosed from 1990-2008, 3) expand the cohort to include of stage I, II, III and DCIS breast cancers diagnosed from 2009-2016, and 4) extend the follow-up on the full cohort through 2017.</p>\r\n<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items.

This</p>\r\n<p>procurement will expand this cohort to include stage III and DCIS breast cancers and to include breast cancers <br />(stage I, II, III and DCIS) diagnosed during 2009-2016. Further the procurement will expand the follow-up <br />period of all patients through 2017.</p>\r\n<p>Radiotherapy study: The procurement will require KP-WA to retrieve and scan radiotherapy summaries from the medical charts for all exposed patients in the original COMBO cohort (1990-2008) plus patients with stage III breast cancer diagnosed between 1990-2008 from the expanded cohort (up to 2800 KP-WA breast cancer patients).</p>\r\n<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.

RFI #EGS_Data_EXploitation1, dated 9 July 2018 requested respondents for comments and recommendations on the DEX architecture and documentation. This RFI requests industry participation in a demonstration event planned in Juanuary 2019.\r\n<p>Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) will provide services across a broad scope of AFSPC/SMC ground activities and will include a service for data exploitation. The Government is developing a reference architecture and prototype for DEX. DEX is an evolvable, adaptable, responsive and resilient cloud-based platform for data analytics that accesses streaming and stored data from EGS resources (satellite, antennae, data center, etc.) and applies advanced analytics, including big data analysis techniques, to extract and deliver timely, accurate, and actionable information to commanders, operators, analysts, and other stakeholders for planning, conducting and assessing satellite operations. These analytical capabilities enable DEX to recognize the context of anomalous behavior to reduce the frequency of false alerts, identify anomalous behavior not detectable by existing limits-based methods, and enable autonomous satellite operations. DEX provides operators with enhanced situational awareness and alerts them of abnormal behavior in real-time.</p>\r\n<p>EGS has developed a DEX prototype with the following capabilities and characteristics:<br />&bull; Capability to ingest live streamed space asset data (e.g. space vehicle telemetry) and to store that data in the space asset's native data format<br />&bull; Capability to integrate and manage user-defined analytics applications utilizing DEX software helper library and tools<br />&bull; RESTful Query Service Application Programming Interface (API) that allows external clients to request stored historical space asset data using a JSON-based search criteria specification<br />&bull; RESTful Streaming Service API that allows external clients to subscribe to live streams of space asset data. Stream registration also includes ability to specify a subset of space asset data fields streamed to an external client</p>\r\n<p>The Government has deployed the EGS DEX prototype onto a private cloud platform in the Space Management Battle Laboratory (SMBL) in Colorado Springs and AFRL's ARCADE laboratory in Albuquerque. This prototype service is compliant with EGS Ground Reference Architecture (GRA) and uses the Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) Software Development Kit (SDK) to acquire space and ground asset data and to interface with other EGS GRA-compliant services.<br /><br />There are two approaches for integrating user-defined analytics with the DEX platform.</p>\r\n<p>a) DEX-Managed Analytics: Software applications are hosted directly on the DEX cloud platform. The execution lifecycle of applications is managed by the DEX platform. Software helper libraries (Java and Python) and tools will be provided to facilitate the integration of the application into DEX.</p>\r\n<p>b) Client-Managed Analytics: Applications interface with DEX using its defined RESTful service APIs. Client software applications interacting with DEX will be hosted on external client development/integration environments (physical or virtual) pre-configured to securely interface with DEX and the private cloud platform.</p>\r\n<p>Need Summary<br />To help with our evaluation of DEX objectives, the Government invites industry to integrate their Sat Ops applications into DEX for a demonstration to Government leadership in January. Interested parties should respond with the following information:</p>\r\n<p>a. A description of company analytics proposed for demonstration. The description should include the following information:<br />i. Functionality and applicable use case(s)<br />ii. Software/Hardware requirements for use in prototype lab<br />iii.

This R&D will underpin coal-fired power plants that are capable of flexible operations to meet the needs of the grid; use innovative and cutting-edge components that improve efficiency and reduce emissions; provide resilient power to Americans; are small compared to today’s conventional utility-scale coal; and will transform how coal technologies are designed and manufactured.    \n\nThe multiple award contracts will be firm-fixed price contracts for a conceptual design with an option Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for a Pre-FEED (nominal AACE class 4) study (including performance and cost estimates).   The anticipated award date for the resulting contracts will be in the second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2019.  Any questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Jason Efaw, at Jason.Efaw@netl.doe.gov.  \n\nBackground:\n\nChanges to the U.S. electricity industry are forcing a paradigm shift in how the nation’s generating assets are operated.  Coal-fired power plants optimized as baseload resources are being increasingly relied on as load-following resources to support electricity generated from intermittent renewable capacity, as well as to provide critical ancillary services to the grid.  These fundamental changes to the operating and economic environment in which coal plants function are expected to persist into the next decade and beyond.\n\nThe aspects of coal-fueled electricity generation that in the past led coal to be the fuel of choice for low cost power are less applicable today, due in large part to sustained low natural gas prices, decreasing capital costs of competing electricity generating technology options, and more frequent dispatch as load-following units.  Historically, coal represented a stable, low-cost fuel option.  Trends in capital costs of competing electricity generating technologies, such as natural gas-fueled and renewable options, have only added pressure on capital intensive coal projects.  Renewable power generation sources are causing non-renewable electricity generators to vary output to accommodate the intermittency of wind and solar power.\n\nThis economic environment for coal-based electric power generation has resulted in very few new domestic coal plants coming online in recent years.  Over the long term, wide-scale retirements of the nation’s existing fleet of coal-fired power plants—without replacement—may lead to a significant undermining of the reliability of America’s electricity supply. Nevertheless, the need for considerable dispatchable generation, critical ancillary services, and grid reliability, combined with potentially higher future natural gas prices, and energy security concerns, such as the importance of onsite fuel availability during extreme weather events, create the opportunity for advanced coal-fired generation, for both domestic and international deployment.  Deployment of new coal plants will require a different way of thinking.\n\nTo that end, DOE envisions that the future coal fleet may be based on electricity generating units possessing many of the following traits:\n•\tHigh overall plant efficiency (40%+ HHV or higher at full load, with minimal reductions in efficiency over the required generation range)\n•\tSmall (unit sizes of approximately 50 to 350 MW), maximizing the benefits of high-quality, low-cost shop fabrication to minimize field construction costs and project cycle time\n•\tNear-zero emissions, with options to consider plant designs that inherently emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide (amounts that are approaching those of comparable natural gas technologies) or could be retrofitted with carbon capture without significant plant modifications \n•\tCapable of high ramp rates and minimum loads \n•\tIntegration with thermal or other energy storage (e.g., chemical production) to ease intermittency inefficiencies and equipment damage\n•\tMinimized water consumption\n•\tReduced design, construction, and commissioning schedules from conventional norms by leveraging techniques including but not limited to advanced process engineering and parametric design methods for modular design\n•\tEnhanced maintenance features including technology advances with monitoring and diagnostics to reduce maintenance and minimize forced outages\n•\tIntegration with coal upgrading, or other plant value streams (e.g., co-production)\n•\tCapable of natural gas co-firing. \n\n\nRequest for Proposal:\n\nUltimately, DOE seeks to understand the configurations, equipment features, performance characteristics, and cost implications for a future commercial coal plant that incorporates, as warranted, the aforementioned attributes through conceptual designs and potential Pre-FEED studies.  Such novel configurations may include, but are not limited to: coal with natural gas combined cycle, indirect sCO2 cycle, advanced ultra-supercritical plant, integrated gasification combined cycle with or without poly-generation (pressurized, oxygen and/or air blown), oxy-combustion systems (pressurized, atmospheric, fluid bed or suspension), poly-generation concepts, or direct syngas/pyrolysis gas sCO2 cycle.  To achieve this end, DOE encourages broad teaming arrangements that engage A/E firms, technology developers, equipment manufacturers, and end users.  \n\nThe option CLIN for the Pre-FEED studies will focus on performance, cost, location, ambient conditions, coal type, etc. after review of the associated conceptual design.  The Government will reserve unilateral right to exercise any options for the Pre-FEED studies.  Pre-FEED studies will be conducted using AACE International Recommended Practice No. 18R-97 Cost Estimate Classification System—As Applied in Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) for the Process Industries.  The areas of focus for this study should be based on a nominal AACE Class 4 Estimate Classification.  \n\nDOE believes this information will be used for a DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) in support of the Fossil Energy Research and Development (R&D) program that may culminate in the design, construction, and operation of one or more pilot-scale plants to test the salient highest risk aspects of advanced commercial coal power plant concepts.\n\nThe North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541715.  All responsible business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.\n\nA solicitation, 89243319RFE000015, is anticipated to be available for downloading during the first quarter FY 2019 on FedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov/) and FedConnect (https://www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/). \n\nOnce the solicitation is issued, the proposal and all questions must be submitted electronically through FedConnect.  Only those questions posted to FedConnect will be accepted.  The Offeror must register with FedConnect to respond as an interested party, to submit questions, and to view responses to questions.\n\nQuestions will not be answered over the phone.  The Contracting Officer must receive questions regarding the Request for Proposal (RFP) via FedConnect by the date and time outlined within the solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to not respond to any questions received after the timeframe identified.  All responses to the solicitation questions will be released on FedConnect referencing the solicitation number, with copies of both questions and answers, without reference to the originating sources.  This is an electronic solicitation, therefore no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.\n\nOnce the solicitation is posted, you will be able to find the RFP by clicking on “Search Public Opportunities” and searching by the RFP Number, 89243319RFE000015.  Please bookmark this page and check it frequently for updates to the RFP.

Collectively, in FY 2019, DOE plans to issue several competitively-funded efforts that may ultimately culminate in the design, construction, and operation of a coal-based pilot-scale power plant.  These efforts are as follows:\n\n1)\tAn RFP seeking conceptual designs and an option to conduct a preliminary front end engineering design (Pre-FEED) to prove the technical feasibility and economics of the approach identified in the conceptual design (aforementioned).  The solicitation is anticipated to be issued in November 2018.\n\n2)\tA FOA for cost-shared R&D projects focused on steam turbines that can be integrated into a 50-350 MW future advanced coal plant design.  The FOA is anticipated to be issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.  \n\n3)\tAn FOA for cost-shared R&D projects focused on critical components and advanced approaches (e.g., manufacturing, fabrication, advanced design) that are needed to support a future coal plant.  This FOA is expected to have two closings.  The objectives and scope of the first closing will be informed by the conceptual designs completed under contracts awarded under the RFP.  Likewise, the objectives and scope of the second closing will be informed by the Pre-FEED studies completed under contracts awarded under the RFP.  The FOA is anticipated to be issued in the third quarter of FY 2019.\n\nThe Coal FIRST initiative will advance coal power generation beyond today’s state-of-the-art to make coal-fired power plants more adaptive to the modern electrical grid.

The NIAID, has a requirement for continue support of the<br />Immune Epitope and Analysis Resource Program, formerly known as the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Program (IEDB), which provides the research community an easy resource for searching experimental data characterizing antibody and T cell epitopes studied in humans, non-human primates, and other animal species, involved in infectious disease, allergy, autoimmunity, and transplant, and tools to assist in the prediction and analysis of B cell and T cell epitopes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\r\n<p>The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) supports<br />extramural grants and contracts for basic, pre-clinical, and clinical research on<br />immune system development and function, and host immune responses in<br />infectious and immune-mediated disorders (e.g., autoimmunity, allergy/asthma,<br />and transplant rejection). This mission includes support of various reagent facilities,<br />repositories, and databases that provide resources for biomedical researchers. As a<br />part of this continuing effort to support the scientific enterprise, the NIAID<br />announces the renewal of the Immune Epitope and Analysis Resource Program to<br />further develop, populate, and maintain a public resource containing antibody/B cell<br />and T cell epitope information, B cell receptor (BCR/T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire<br />analyses, and epitope prediction and analysis tools for use by the research<br />community worldwide. For this RFP, immune epitopes are defined as molecular<br />structures recognized by specific antigen receptors of the immune system, namely<br />antibodies, BCRs, and TCRs. Immune epitopes involved in infectious and immunemediated diseases and the accompanying biological information will be included in the Immune Epitope and Analysis Resource Program (IEDB).</p>\r\n<p>The effectiveness of adaptive immune responses is related to the diverse functions<br />of B and T cells as well as to interactions with cells of the innate immune system.<br />With respect to diversity, B cells secrete antibodies with different functions and T<br />cells differentiate into subsets that lyse infected target cells, secrete inflammatory<br />and regulatory cytokines, and promote powerful antibody responses. Knowledge of<br />antigen specificity is very important in understanding the generation, maintenance<br />and control of adaptive immunity in infection or immune-mediated diseases. In<br />addition, immune epitopes can be difficult to reliably and accurately predict using<br />current epitope prediction algorithms, especially for antibodies and for MHC<br />molecules that have limited ligand binding data. Therefore, development of<br />improved prediction tools will be greatly enhanced by better information on the<br />epitopes recognized by antibodies/BCRs and TCRs/MHC molecules. Such advances<br />would potentially include better ways to interrogate the repertoire of different B and<br />T cell receptors and their relation to epitope binding in humans and other model<br />immune systems. Overall, understanding the nature of immune epitopes recognized<br />by T and B cells will expedite the development of new therapies to prevent and<br />treat infection, organ and tissue transplant rejection, and autoimmune and allergic<br />disorders.</p>\r\n<p>In December 2003, the NIAID awarded the original IEDB contract to the La Jolla<br />Institute of Allergy and Immunology (N01-AI-40006) and subsequently awarded<br />the successor contract to the same contractor in December 2011<br />(HHSN272201200010C). The IEDB website, containing immune epitope information<br />and analysis tools, became publicly available in 2005 (www.iedb.org) and currently<br />contains detailed information for over 298,000 unique immune epitopes curated<br />from more than 18,000 journal references or direct submissions from the research<br />community related to infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The Analysis<br />Resource includes the following computational/bioinformatics tools:</p>\r\n<p>1. Epitope prediction tools:<br />a. T cell epitope predictions based on MHC class I or class II binding, or<br />peptide processing, or immunogenicity predictions<br />(http://tools.iedb.org/main/tcell/)<br />b. B cell epitope and structure predictions<br />(http://tools.iedb.org/main/bcell/)<br />2. Epitope analysis tools (http://tools.iedb.org/main/analysis-tools/):<br />a. Population coverage - calculates the fraction of individuals predicted to<br />respond to a given set of epitopes with known MHC restrictions.<br />b. Conservancy analysis - determines the degree of conservancy of an<br />epitope within a related protein sequence set at different degrees of<br />sequence identity.<br />c. Cluster analysis - groups epitopes into clusters based on a degree of<br />sequence identity.<br />d. Computational methods for mapping mimotopes to protein antigens -<br />provides information on available methods for mimotope mapping,<br />how to search the IEDB for mimotopes, and an example of a mimotope<br />dataset and the results of its mapping, using other publicly available<br />web servers.</p>\r\n<p>The system architecture and software design specifications and entity relational<br />diagrams of the current IEDB system are available at the IEDB website:<br />http://help.iedb.org/hc/en-us/articles/114094150691-IEDB-System-Architectureand-<br />Design</p>\r\n<p>The main goal of this solicitation is to continue support of the IEDB which provides<br />the research community an easy resource for searching experimental data<br />characterizing antibody and T cell epitopes studied in humans, non-human<br />primates, and other animal species, involved in infectious disease, allergy,<br />autoimmunity, and transplant, and tools to assist in the prediction and analysis of B<br />cell and T cell epitopes. No changes are anticipated to the scope of work from the<br />previous solicitation in terms of the types of immune epitopes to be included in the<br />IEDB. In addition, since this solicitation is a re-competition of an existing public<br />resource, there is no requirement to develop the IEDB and operating system de<br />novo. Offerors can access the specifications for the current IEDB operating system<br />at: http://help.iedb.org/hc/en-us/articles/114094150691-IEDB-System-<br />Architecture-and-Design. Subsequent contractors are expected to use/improve<br />upon the existing IEDB system. Funding under the prior solicitation is NOT required<br />for submission to this current solicitation.</p>\r\n<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the<br />Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about 11/20/2017, and may be<br />accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

No response is required at this time.\r\n<p>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this pre-announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) that aims to develop a lead prototype compound (pre-clinical candidate) that must be efficacious against clinically-relevant gram negative bacteria in animal infection models, have clinically acceptable pharmacokinetics (PK) and dynamics for oral or parenteral administration, and a low-to-acceptable toxicity profile.</p>\r\n<p>Purpose<br />Skin and soft tissue infections caused by the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) are of serious concern for hospitalized Wounded Warriors. These infections are often multidrug-resistant (MDR) and can lead to amputations, amputation revision, sepsis, and death. Current antibiotics are becoming less efficacious as resistance is being built into the military population. A new therapeutic with extensive coverage and acceptance is required.<br />Therefore, the focus of this RPP is to recruit a partner(s) (i.e., antibiotic (AB)-focused pharmaceutical companies and/or product-focused academic/non-profit research institutions) to move an AB hit or early lead molecule from lead optimization or early preclinical development to a preclinical decision. The offeror can utilize this funding independently or partner with WRAIR Division of Experimental Therapeutics (ET) and Bacterial Diseases Branches (BDB) AB test systems. Additional information will be provided in the RPP.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Requirements<br />The goal of an MTEC award will be to create a small molecule AB candidate or chemical series with the following characteristics:<br />&bull; Efficacious against clinically-relevant, MDR, Gram-negative bacteria in mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) 90 panels of relevant, MDR, clinical isolates.

The processed information will support the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission, protect \"blue\" coalition forces with command, control, computer and intelligence applications, and support battlespace awareness for the warfighter. Solutions to engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought. The Government is not looking for point solutions, but rather solutions which are focused on versatile multi-agency systems that rely on an open architecture with scalable technologies. The breadth of the technology timeline ranges from <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">quick reaction</span> capabilities to critical near term shortfalls to proof-of-concept for heretofore undemonstrated technical capabilities.</p>\r\n<p>The overall technical objective of this BAA is two-fold. The first component of the objective is in the area of ISR information extraction for SIGINT issues, including new and innovative methods and processing techniques that will provide decision-makers with ISR information in as near real-time as possible. SIGINT technologies process information on various communications mediums, operate in environments in low signal-to-noise ratio areas and conduct operations against <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">uncooperative</span> targets where the noise types and channel conditions are frequently varying from message to message. As time is critical and ISR mission analysts' workload is high, the automation of the SIGINT collection, processing and exploitation capabilities in both tasking and training is a major goal. The SIGINT research and development is grouped into three broad technology areas: Information Extraction, Signal Processing, and Automation Enhancements. The first, Information Extraction, extracts information from the broadband signal to identify and catalog Signals of Interest (SOI). The second area, Signal Processing, processes the signal to improve signal processor performance for the above information extraction capabilities. This area represents research in removing noise and interference in a channel or in multiple channels from signals. The third broad area, Automation Enhancements, uses signal processing techniques to automate the manual techniques that are current practice. This automation may be used to manipulate the SOI for storage and transmission or to synthesize the signal for a variety of purposes.</p>\r\n<p>The second component of this BAA is to research unique and innovative techniques and algorithms that provide the identification, collection, processing, and exploitation of electronic communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment with potentially significant Doppler effects. The goals for this component are to develop methods for the detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation of emerging communications and low radiated power level signals of interest; advance digital signal processing software methodologies to provide new and existing systems and waveforms; develop new and innovative software and hardware architectures for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">standoff collection</span> systems; develop and integrate these capabilities into information operations and collection systems; and develop the ability to characterize cognitive, software-defined radios from either airborne or ground-based platforms operating in dense signal environments. As part of this objective, the Government wishes to leverage existing technology in the areas of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and cyber operations developed by academia and industry as well as from other organizations. Automated signal processing is a key component for net-centric warfare. Areas of interest include: augmenting and modifying existing fielded systems; discovering and improving novel capabilities on commercial and personal communications platforms; and developing an automated Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) signal processing framework that provides rapid signal processing and cyber operations capabilities to enable the warfighter to respond in near real-time to threats in hostile areas of operation.</p>\r\n<p>The innovative techniques and capabilities described in this BAA play a vital role in capturing Measure Of Performance (MOP) and Measure Of Effectiveness (MOE) indicators which are crucial for information operations. Information furnished from the intelligence gathering and processing technologies provides the continuous decision-quality information necessary to successfully employ air, space and cyber operations. Integration of these techniques into information operations systems and the timely incorporation into the battle planning process is of high interest.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH</span></strong>. It is DoD policy that the publication of products of fundamental research will remain unrestricted to the maximum extent possible. National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189 defines fundamental research as follows:</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Fundamental research' means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons.</p>\r\n<p>As of the date of publication of this BAA, the Government cannot identify whether work proposed under this BAA may be considered fundamental research and may award both fundamental and non-fundamental research. Offerors should indicate in their proposal whether they believe the scope of the research included in their proposal is fundamental or not. While offerors should clearly explain the intended results of their research, the Government shall have sole discretion to select award instrument type and to negotiate all instrument terms and conditions with selectees. Appropriate clauses will be included in resultant awards for non-fundamental research to prescribe publication requirements and other restrictions, as appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>For certain research projects, it may be possible that although the research being performed by the awardee is restricted research, a sub-awardee may be conducting fundamental research. In those cases, it is the awardee's responsibility to explain in their proposal why its sub-awardee's effort is fundamental research.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CLOUD COMPUTING</span></strong>. In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.239-7010, if the development proposed requires storage of Government, or Government-related data on the cloud, offerors need to ensure that the cloud service provider proposed has been granted Provisional Authorization by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) at the level appropriate to the requirement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>II. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">AWARD INFORMATION</span>:</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $99.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>FY19 - $28.87M<br />FY20 - $36.08M<br />FY21 - $34.95M</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; a. Individual awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar values normally ranging from $250K to $4.5M. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value as long as the value does not exceed the available BAA ceiling amount.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; b. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received, subject to the availability of funds. All potential Offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>\r\n<p>2. FORM. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.</p>\r\n<p>3.

The above requirements are in addition to any other contract requirements related to obtaining a Common Access Card (CAC). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. For the purposes of Paragraph 1, if an IT network/system does not require AFRL to endorse a contractor's application to said network/system in order to gain access, the organization operating the IT network/system is responsible for controlling access to its system. If an IT network/system requires a U.S. Government sponsor to endorse the application in order for access to the IT network/system, AFRL will only endorse the following types of applications, consistent with the requirements above:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Contractor employees who are U.S. citizens performing work under contracts, assistance instruments or other transactions awarded under this BAA.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Contractor employees who are non-U.S. citizens and who have been granted a waiver.</p>\r\n<p>Any additional access restrictions established by the IT network/system owner apply.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES: Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Government entities (e.g., Government/National laboratories, military educational institutions, etc.) are subject to applicable direct competition limitations and cannot propose to this BAA in any capacity unless they meet the following conditions:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">FFRDCs</span>: FFRDCs must clearly demonstrate that the proposed work is not otherwise available from the private sector; and FFRDCs must provide a letter on official letterhead from their sponsoring organization citing the specific authority establishing their eligibility to propose to Government solicitations and compete with industry, and their compliance with the associated FFRDC sponsor agreement's terms and conditions. This information is required for FFRDCs proposing to be prime contractors or sub-awardees.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Government Entities</span>: Government entities must clearly demonstrate that the work is not otherwise available from the private sector and provide written documentation citing the specific statutory authority and contractual authority, if relevant, establishing their ability to propose to Government solicitations. While 10 U.S.C.&sect; 2539b may be the appropriate statutory starting point for some entities, specific supporting regulatory guidance, together with evidence of agency approval, will still be required to fully establish eligibility.</p>\r\n<p>FFRDC and Government entity eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis; however, the burden to prove eligibility for all team members rests solely with the proposer.</p>\r\n<p>Government agencies interested in performing work related to this announcement should contact the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC). If resulting discussions reveal a mutual interest, cooperation may be pursued via other vehicles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>IV. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION</span>:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Technical Point of Contact (TPOC)</span> listed in SECTION VII. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">DO NOT</span> send white papers to the Contracting Officer.</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.

ALLOWABLE CHARGES: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is <strong>not considered</strong> an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by 2 CFR part 200.458, Pre-Award Costs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a<strong> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">U. S. Government approved</span></strong> accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IMPORTANT</span></strong>: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1\">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_<br />cview=1</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. HUMAN USE: All research involving human subjects, to include the use of human biological specimens and human data, selected for funding must comply with Federal regulations for human subject protection. Further, research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the DoD must comply with 32 CFR 219, \"Protection of Human Subjects\" found at: <a href=\"http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/32cfr219_07.html\">http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/32cfr219_07.html</a>, and DoD Instruction 3216.02, \"Protection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD-Supported Research\" found at: <a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf\">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Institutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for example a Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide Assurance found at: <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp\">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. All institutions engaged in human subject research, to include subcontractors, must have a valid assurance. In addition, personnel involved in human subject research must document the completion of appropriate training for the protection of human subjects.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. For all research that will involve human subjects in the first year or phase of the project, the institution must submit evidence of a plan for review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) as part of the proposal. The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the institution's Assurance of Compliance. The protocol, separate from the proposal, must include a detailed description of the research plan, study population, risks and benefits of study participation, recruitment and consent process, data collection, and data analysis. The designated IRB should be consulted for guidance on writing the protocol. The informed consent document must comply with 32 CFR 219.116. A valid Assurance of Compliance and evidence of appropriate training by all investigators should accompany the protocol for review by the IRB.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. In addition to a local IRB approval, an AFRL-level human subject regulatory review and approval is required for all research conducted or supported by the DoD. The Air Force office responsible for managing the award can provide guidance and information about the AFRL-level review process. Confirmation of a current Assurance of Compliance and appropriate human subjects protection training is required before AFRL-level approval can be issued.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The time required to complete the IRB review/approval process will vary depending on the complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants; ample time should be allotted to complete the approval process. The IRB approval process can last between 1 to 3 months, followed by a DoD review that could last 3 to 6 months. No funding may be used toward human subject research until all approvals are granted. Therefore, in their cost proposals offerors should separate human use into a separate option.</p>\r\n<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">descending order of importance</span> and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <strong>The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal</strong>, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <strong>The potential contributions of the effort to the Rome Research Site</strong>, Information Directorate mission or its customers and the extent to which the proposed effort will contribute to balancing the overall research and development program of AFRL and its customers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. <strong>Related Experience</strong> - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. <strong>Openness/Maturity of Solution</strong> - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. <strong>The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any</strong></p>\r\n<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used to select white papers for proposal invitation. Proposals will be evaluated IAW this evaluation criteria only and categorized/selected for award as detailed in Section V.2.b.2. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>\r\n<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as \"handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks.\" These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <strong>WHITE PAPER/PROPOSAL REVIEW PROCESS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <strong>FIRST STEP</strong> - White Paper Reviews: The Government will review White Papers to determine which of them have the potential to best meet the Air Force's needs based on the criteria listed above. If white papers are of interest and funding is available, AFRL/RI will request a formal technical and cost proposal from offeror. If white papers are not of interest or there is not funding available, a letter will be sent to the offeror indicating the reason not selected.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <strong>SECOND STEP - Proposal Review and Selection Process</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) <strong>Categories</strong>: Based on the evaluation, proposals will be categorized as Selectable or Not Selectable (see definitions below). The selection of one or more offerors for award will be based on the evaluation, as well as importance to agency programs and funding availability.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <strong>Selectable</strong>: Proposals are recommended for acceptance, if sufficient funding* is available.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <strong>Not Selectable</strong>: Even if sufficient funding existed, the proposal should not be funded.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <em>Selectable proposals will be designated as funded or unfunded. Letters will be sent to the unfunded offerors. These proposals may be funded at a later date without reevaluation, if funding becomes available</em>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The Government reserves the right to award some, all, or none of the proposals. When the Government elects to award only a part of a proposal, the selected part may be categorized as Selectable, though the proposal as a whole may not merit such a categorization.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposals' technical, cost, and schedule risk will be assessed as part of the above evaluation criteria's application. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Proposal risk for schedule relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Prior to award of a potentially successful offer, the Contracting Officer will make a determination regarding price reasonableness and realism.</p>\r\n<p>3. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6.</p>\r\n<p><strong>VI. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD</strong>:</p>\r\n<p>1. PROPOSAL FORMATING: When developing proposals, reference the AFRL \"Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry,\" Mar 2015, and RI-Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions, Jun 2018, which may be accessed at: <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1\">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_<br />cview=1</a>. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Always reference the newest versions of these documents</span></strong>.</p>\r\n<p>2. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the research areas of interest and expected results within the broad topic areas as described in the Technology Requirements section of this BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the TPOC. Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. All offerors submitting proposals will receive notification of their evaluation results within 45 days of submission. Offerors should email the TPOC and the Contracting Officer listed in Section VII, for status of their proposal after 45 days, if no such correspondence has been received.</p>\r\n<p>3. DEBRIEFINGS: If a debriefing is requested in accordance with the time guidelines set out in FAR 15.505 and 15.506, a debriefing will be provided, but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016). Debriefings will not be provided for white papers.</p>\r\n<p>4. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. FACILITY CLEARANCE. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a <strong>SECRET or TOP SECRET//SCI</strong> facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to <strong>SECRET or TOP SECRET//SCI</strong> information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. EXPORT CONTROL LAWS. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href=\"http://www.dla.mil/HQ/InformationOperations/LogisticsInformationServices.aspx\">http://www.dla.mil/HQ/InformationOperations/LogisticsInformationServices.aspx</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-2255 (24/7). You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION. The Government encourages the best sources from the scientific and industrial communities to propose, including small business concerns, large businesses, academia and non-profit entities. Non-small business concerns are encourage to team with small business concerns to come up with the best technical solutions and obtain the best mix of cost, performance and schedule.</p>\r\n<p>5. DATA RIGHTS:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The Air Force Research Laboratory is engaged in the discovery, development, and integration of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace forces. As such, rights in technical data and Noncommercial Computer Software (NCS) developed or delivered under this contract are of significant concern to the Government. The Government will therefore carefully consider any restrictions on the use of technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation which could result in transition difficulty or less-than full and open competition for subsequent development of this technology.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Third Party Software. DFARS 252.227-7014(d) describes requirements for incorporation of third party computer software. Any third party software (commercial and noncommercial) to be incorporated into a deliverable must be clearly identified in the proposal. Prior to delivery of any third party software, the contractor will obtain an appropriate license for the Government, and the written approval of the contracting officer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. IDENTIFICATION &amp; ASSERTION. IAW DFARS 252.227-7017, the Identification and assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restriction provision applies. See AFRL/RI Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions for further guidance and samples.</p>\r\n<p>6. REPORTING: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. FAPIIS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, Non-Federal Entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>\r\n<p>7. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>\r\n<p>8. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">GRANT AWARDS ONLY</span></strong>: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant.

For example, an AI can be trained on images of traffic signs, learn what stop signs and speed limit signs look like, and then be deployed as part an autonomous car. The problem is that an adversary that can disrupt the training pipeline can insert Trojan behaviors into the AI. For example, an AI learning to distinguish traffic signs can be given just a few additional examples of stop signs with yellow squares on them, each labeled \"speed limit sign.\" If the AI were deployed in a self-driving car, an adversary could cause the car to run through the stop sign just by putting a sticky note on it (see figure below). The goal of the TrojAI program is to combat such Trojan attacks by inspecting AIs for Trojans.</div>\r\n<p>This Draft Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is NOT a formal request for proposal.
