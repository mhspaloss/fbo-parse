Commanders must be able to command and control lines of communication in today's information dominated environment. The network is the \"critical tool\" to accomplish the mission. The network brings together platforms, sensors &amp; shooters at the Commander's disposal to dynamically task and rapidly deploy in response to threats and mission needs as they evolve. A timely, secure, and mission-responsive network is critical to the translation of sensory data into actionable information and for assuring tailored communications globally, from the (permissive) C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) enterprise to the (highly contested) tactical edge. To build future AF network capabilities that can respond to the mission, operations tempo, and threat environment, the Government cannot rely solely on a data-neutral network. The future lies in affordable, extensible, interoperable communications architectures that intelligently distribute information in a robust way that enables shared situational awareness and timely decision-making, ultimately, to assure the mission.</p>\r\n<p>White papers may describe but are not limited to</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;\tHardware brass-boards and/or software systems development. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;\tActivities for validation with model-based system design and simulation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;\tDemonstration of hardware brass-boards and antenna in-the-loop validation techniques.</p>\r\n<p>Research efforts under this BAA are expected to result in functional capabilities, concepts, theory, applications and demonstrations addressing Air Force aerial network connectivity problems. The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through testing and evaluation activities. Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use are of high interest. Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work effectively.</p>\r\n<p>&emsp;<br />Work is encouraged in, but not limited to, these focus areas:</p>\r\n<p>1.0\tAgile, Resilient, Affordable, and IP capable battlefield networking architecture integrating alternative Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tDevelop functional capabilities, concepts, theory and application using existing infrastructure to ensure backwards compatibility along with mature technology to support operations in Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and PNT denied or restricted environments to include Anti-Access, Area Denied (A2/AD) operations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tThis capability will be achieve by focusing on aircraft integration to ensure affordability and enhance flexibility in supporting changes in mission and technology.  Implementation will use military communication links.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tThe proposed architecture will provide support for several Combatant Command (COCOM) missions in a SATCOM restricted or denied environment as well as accelerate the speed of decision to get inside the enemy's Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop.</p>\r\n<p>2.0\tAgile Communication Links &amp; Networks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tDevelop reliable wideband connectivity capabilities to support: (i) agile wideband communications; (ii) affordable, secure, and robust multi-mission radio frequency (RF) functions; and (iii) advanced low probability of intercept (LPI), low probability of detection (LPD), and anti&#8208;jam (AJ) modes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tPush the state-of-the-art in military link capacity from single to tens of Gigabits per second to keep pace with the growing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor suite output. Some of this wideband capability will be leveraged for servicing key nodes in the high capacity backbone envisaged by the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tThis work is comprised of both line of sight (LOS), to include hybrid RF and optical links, and beyond line of sight (BLOS) connectivity, to include satellite and over-the-horizon communications. Both LOS and BLOS communications must be exploited by an aerial network (AN) to provide a resilient information transport capability.</p>\r\n<p>3.0\tTactical Network Security/Information Assurance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tDemonstrate ability to securely share multiple forms of information (e.g., voice, video, text, files) among networks of differing classifications and releasabilities. Information exchanges are secured through a combination of data inspection to prevent data spills and propagation of cyber-attacks, data canonicalization to simplify these data inspection techniques, and novel methods to attest the provenance of trusted data in an assured manner.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tDevelop a more agile and robust information management capability that spans security domains, allowing for more seamless sharing with our coalition partners. The secure data sharing capability develops technologies to enable both information sharing and data exchange across multiple security domains (e.g. JWICS, SIPRNET, NIPRNET, coalition networks) and also push the state-of-the-possible in object&#8208;level protection at a level commensurate with enforcing mandatory access controls on a single, multi&#8208;level network.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;\tDemonstrate a wide range of information exchange capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, secure, resilient, context-aware, federated and responsive to dynamic mission conditions and management policies. The technologies to support these capabilities include: mission-oriented architectures, Quality of Service policies, publish/subscribe/query mechanisms, semantic characterization, federation, machine learning, opportunistic resource scheduling, peer-to-peer protocols, and open system architectures.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING</span>:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH</span></strong>.  It is DoD policy that the publication of products of fundamental research will remain unrestricted to the maximum extent possible. National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189 defines fundamental research as follows:</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Fundamental research' means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons.</p>\r\n<p>As of the date of publication of this BAA, the Government cannot identify whether work proposed under this BAA may be considered fundamental research and may award both fundamental and non-fundamental research.  Offerors should indicate in their proposal whether they believe the scope of the research included in their proposal is fundamental or not. While offerors should clearly explain the intended results of their research, the Government shall have sole discretion to select award instrument type and to negotiate all instrument terms and conditions with selectees. Appropriate clauses will be included in resultant awards for non-fundamental research to prescribe publication requirements and other restrictions, as appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>For certain research projects, it may be possible that although the research being performed by the awardee is restricted research, a sub-awardee may be conducting fundamental research.  In those cases, it is the awardee's responsibility to explain in their proposal why its sub-awardee's effort is fundamental research.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CLOUD COMPUTING</span></strong>.  In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.239-7010, if the development proposed requires storage of Government, or Government-related data on the cloud, offerors need to ensure that the cloud service provider proposed has been granted Provisional Authorization by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) at the level appropriate to the requirement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>II. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">AWARD INFORMATION</span>:</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.

Offerors are responsible for ensuring that all employees and/or subcontractors who will work on a resulting contract are eligible to do so.  Any employee who is not a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident will be restricted from working on any resultant contract unless prior approval of the Department of State or the Department of Commerce is obtained via a technical assistance agreement or an export license. Violations of these regulations can result in criminal or civil penalties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c.\tInformation Regarding Non-US Citizens Assigned to this Project</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.\tContractor employees requiring access to USAF bases, AFRL facilities, and/or access to U.S. Government Information Technology (IT) networks in connection with the work on contracts, assistance instruments or other transactions awarded under this BAA <strong>must be U.S. citizens</strong>.  For the purpose of base and network access, possession of a permanent resident card (\"Green Card\") does not equate to U.S. citizenship.  This requirement does not apply to foreign nationals approved by the U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. State Department under international personnel exchange agreements with foreign governments.  It also does not apply to dual citizens who possess US citizenship, to include Naturalized citizens.  Any waivers to this requirement must be granted in writing by the Contracting Officer prior to providing access.  Specific format for waiver request will be provided upon request to the Contracting Officer.  The above requirements are in addition to any other contract requirements related to obtaining a Common Access Card (CAC).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.\tFor the purposes of Paragraph 1, if an IT network/system does not require AFRL to endorse a contractor's application to said network/system in order to gain access, the organization operating the IT network/system is responsible for controlling access to its system.  If an IT network/system requires a U.S. Government sponsor to endorse the application in order for access to the IT network/system, AFRL will only endorse the following types of applications, consistent with the requirements above:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a)\tContractor employees who are U.S. citizens performing work under contracts, assistance instruments or other transactions awarded under this BAA.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b)\tContractor employees who are non-U.S. citizens and who have been granted a waiver.</p>\r\n<p>Any additional access restrictions established by the IT network/system owner apply.</p>\r\n<p>3.  FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES:  Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Government entities (e.g., Government/National laboratories, military educational institutions, etc.) are subject to applicable direct competition limitations and cannot propose to this BAA in any capacity unless they meet the following conditions:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; a.\t<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">FFRDCs</span>:  FFRDCs must clearly demonstrate that the proposed work is not otherwise available from the private sector; and FFRDCs must provide a letter on official letterhead from their sponsoring organization citing the specific authority establishing their eligibility to propose to Government solicitations and compete with industry, and their compliance with the associated FFRDC sponsor agreement's terms and conditions.  This information is required for FFRDCs proposing to be prime contractors or sub-awardees.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; b.\t<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Government Entities</span>:  Government entities must clearly demonstrate that the work is not otherwise available from the private sector and provide written documentation citing the specific statutory authority and contractual authority, if relevant, establishing their ability to propose to Government solicitations.  While 10 U.S.C.&sect; 2539b may be the appropriate statutory starting point for some entities, specific supporting regulatory guidance, together with evidence of agency approval, will still be required to fully establish eligibility.</p>\r\n<p>FFRDC and Government entity eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis; however, the burden to prove eligibility for all team members rests solely with the offeror.</p>\r\n<p>Government agencies interested in performing work related to this announcement should contact the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC).  If resulting discussions reveal a mutual interest, cooperation may be pursued via other vehicles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>IV. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION</span>: </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Technical Point of Contact (TPOC)</span> listed in SECTION VII. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">DO NOT</span> send white papers to the Contracting Officer.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.

Further, research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the DoD must comply with 32 CFR 219, \"Protection of Human Subjects\" found at:  http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/32cfr219_07.html,  and DoD Directive 3216.02, \"Protection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD-Supported Research\" found at:  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.\tInstitutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for example a Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide Assurance found at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.\tAll institutions engaged in human subject research, to include subcontractors, must have a valid assurance. In addition, personnel involved in human subject research must document the completion of appropriate training for the protection of human subjects.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.\tFor all research that will involve human subjects in the first year or phase of the project, the institution must submit evidence of a plan for review by an institutional review board (IRB) as part of the proposal. The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the institution's Assurance of Compliance. The protocol, separate from the proposal, must include a detailed description of the research plan, study population, risks and benefits of study participation, recruitment and consent process, data collection, and data analysis. The designated IRB should be consulted for guidance on writing the protocol. The informed consent document must comply with 32 CFR 219.116. A valid Assurance of Compliance and evidence of appropriate training by all investigators should accompany the protocol for review by the IRB.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.\tIn addition to a local IRB approval, An AFRL-level human subject regulatory review and approval is required for all research conducted or supported by the DoD. The Air Force office responsible for managing the award can provide guidance and information about the AFRL-level review process.  Confirmation of a current Assurance of Compliance and appropriate human subjects protection training is required before AFRL-level approval can be issued.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.\tThe time required to complete the IRB review/approval process will vary depending on the complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants; ample time should be allotted to complete the approval process. The IRB approval process can last between 1 to 3 months, followed by a DoD review that could last 3 to 6 months. No funding may be used toward human subject research until all approvals are granted.  Therefore, in their cost proposals offerors should separate human use into a separate option.</p>\r\n<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.\tCRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">listed in descending order of&nbsp;importance</span></strong> will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.\tOverall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b.\tRelated Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c.\tOpenness and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d.\tReasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>\r\n<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used to select white papers for proposal invitation.  Proposals will be evaluated IAW this evaluation criteria only and categorized/selected for award as detailed in Section V.2.b.2.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>\r\n<p>2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.\tOnly Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as \"handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks.\"  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b.\t<strong>WHITE PAPER/PROPOSAL REVIEW PROCESS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.\t<strong>FIRST STEP - White Paper Reviews:</strong> The Government will review White Papers to identify those with the greatest potential to best meet the Air Force's needs based on the criteria listed above.  If funding is available for an identified white paper, AFRL/RI will request a formal technical and cost proposal from offeror. For white papers not of interest to the Government, or for which funding is not available, those offerors will receive letters from the Government indicating the basis for non-selection.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.\t<strong>SECOND STEP - Proposal Review and Selection Process</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a) <strong>Categories</strong>: Based on the evaluation, proposals will be categorized as Selectable or Not Selectable (see definitions below). The selection of one or more offerors for award will be based on the evaluation, as well as importance to agency programs and funding availability.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. <strong>Selectable</strong>: Proposals are recommended for acceptance, if sufficient funding* is available.  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. <strong>Not Selectable</strong>: Even if sufficient funding existed, the proposal should not be funded.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * <em>Selectable proposals will be designated as funded or unfunded.  Letters will be sent to the unfunded offerors. These proposals may be funded at a later date without reevaluation, if funding becomes available</em>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b) The Government reserves the right to award some, all, or none of the proposals. When the Government elects to award only a part of a proposal, the selected part may be categorized as Selectable, though the proposal as a whole may not merit such a categorization.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c) Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposals' technical, cost, and schedule risk will be assessed as part of the above evaluation criteria's application. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Proposal risk for schedule relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d) Prior to award of a potentially successful offer, the Contracting Officer will make a determination regarding price reasonableness and realism.</p>\r\n<p>3.  FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS:  As required by 2 CFR 200 of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, the Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) over the period of performance.  An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered.  The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and FAR 9.104-6.</p>\r\n<p><strong>VI. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.  PROPOSAL FORMATING: When developing proposals, reference the AFRL \"Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry,\" Mar 2015, and RI-Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions, Jun 2018, which may be accessed at: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1.  <strong>Always reference the newest versions of these documents</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>2.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the research areas of interest and expected results within the broad topic areas as described in the Technology Requirements section of this BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the TPOC.  Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All offerors submitting proposals will receive notification of their evaluation results within 45 days of submission.  Offerors should email the TPOC and the Contracting Officer listed in Section VII, for status of their proposal after 45 days, if no such correspondence has been received.</p>\r\n<p>3.  DEBRIEFINGS: If a debriefing is requested in accordance with the time guidelines set out in FAR 15.505 and 15.506, a debriefing will be provided, but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016). <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Debriefings will not be provided for white papers</span>.</p>\r\n<p>4.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a.\tFACILITY CLEARANCE.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a <strong>SECRET or TOP SECRET//SCI</strong> facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to&nbsp;<strong>SECRET&nbsp;or TOP SECRET//SCI</strong> information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b.\tEXPORT CONTROL LAWS.  Awards made under this solicitation may require access to data subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.  For questions, contact DLIS on-line at http://www.dla.mil/HQ/InformationOperations/LogisticsInformationServices.aspx or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-2255 (24/7).  Submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; c.\tSMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.  The Government encourages the best sources from the scientific and industrial communities to propose, including small businesses, large businesses, academia and non-profit entities.  Non-small business are encourage to team with small businesses to come up with the best technical solutions and obtain the best mix of cost, performance and schedule.</p>\r\n<p>5.  DATA RIGHTS:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.\tSBIR RIGHTS.  The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized.  In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration.  Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b.\tNON-SBIR RIGHTS. <br /> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.\tNon-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis.  Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>\r\n<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.\tThe Air Force Research Laboratory is engaged in the discovery, development, and integration of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace forces. As such, rights in technical data and noncommercial computer software (NCS) developed or delivered under this contract are of significant concern to the Government. The Government will therefore carefully consider any restrictions on the use of technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation which could result in transition difficulty or less-than full and open competition for subsequent development of this technology.</p>\r\n<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.\tThird Party Software.  DFARS 252.227-7014(d) describes requirements for incorporation of third party computer software. Any third party software (commercial and noncommercial) to be incorporated into a deliverable must be clearly identified in the proposal. Prior to delivery of any third party software, the contractor will obtain an appropriate license for the Government, and the written approval of the contracting officer.</p>\r\n<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c.\t IDENTIFICATION &amp; ASSERTION.  IAW DFARS 252.227-7017, the Identification and assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restriction provision applies.  See AFRL/RI Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions for further guidance and samples.</p>\r\n<p>6.  REPORTING:   <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Contract Applicable:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b.  FAPIIS Applicable:  As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide.  This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>\r\n<p>7.  NOTICE:  The following provisions* apply:<br />&nbsp; (a)  FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />&nbsp; (b)  DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />&nbsp; (c)  DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>\r\n<p>8.  <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">GRANT AWARDS ONLY</span></strong>:  For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant.

The Government intends to issue RFP No. N01TR-19-2006, titled \"CRO Support for NCATS Medicinal Chemistry for Lead Optimization,\" via FedBizOpps on or about November 21, 2018.</p>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENT AND TYPE OF SERVICE</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development.</p>\r\n<p>The objective of this contract is to support the DPI drug development programs by identifying preclinical drug candidates with improved efficacy, optimized ADME properties, and minimal predicted toxicity.</p>\r\n<p>One of the DPI program requirements is to efficiently identify preclinical development candidates for rare and neglected diseases. To accomplish this endeavor, DPI has a need for a team of chemists; pharmacologists; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)/pharmacokinetics (PK) experts; and toxicologists working closely together to perform medicinal chemistry lead optimization.</p>\r\n<p>While this Contract will be primarily in support of the DPI drug development programs. The Government reserves the right to allow other drug development programs at NIH to solicit task order proposals. As such, this Contract is not limited to rare or neglected disorders.</p>\r\n<p><strong>RELEASE OF SOLICITATION</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposals on or about November 21, 2018. Proposals will be due 45 calendar days following release of the RFP.</p>\r\n<p>The Government anticipates making multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract awards -with the eventual contracts being administered and funded via Task Orders (TOs). <br />The ultimate goal of DPI and this planned project is to bring new drugs to market. To this end, the Government has issued a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses at 52.227-11 Patent Rights and 52.227-14 Rights in Data. The deviated language enables DPI contributors to retain control of their intellectual property and will be included in the RFP and incorporated in any resultant contract. Prospective Offerors are advised that agreement to the terms of these FAR clauses deviations will be a condition for contract award.</p>\r\n<p>This is a new requirement; therefore, no incumbent information is provided. The Government will select proposals that are most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the basis of award included in the solicitation.</p>\r\n<p>The Government anticipates awards will be made in the fourth quarter of FY2019.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ABOUT DPI AND NCATS</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts translational research in human therapeutics development and aims to move small molecule and biologic drug candidates forward in the drug development pipeline to predetermined milestones, at which point, DPI will hand off the drug candidate to external partner(s) to bring the novel therapy to patients.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to developing new candidate drugs, DPI seeks to advance the entire field of drug discovery and development by encouraging scientific and technological innovations aimed at improving success rates in the crucial pre-clinical stage of drug development. DPI's model is to operate as a full range small molecule and biologics drug development organization, moving drug candidates through each phase of the pre-clinical drug development process until an Investigational New Drug (IND) is filed<br />with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>\r\n<p>DPI conducts drug development as collaborations through programs such as the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) and the Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) programs. DPI drug development programs originate from academia, industry, non-profit foundations, or internally from NCATS and other NIH Institutes, and its research and development (R&amp;D) operational strategy is to combine the capabilities of DPI in-house staff and DPI partners, who may be the drug originators. Each drug program operates in a multi-disciplinary, multi-partnership matrix team environment, and a DPI program officer is responsible for the overall planning, execution, and reporting of the program.</p>\r\n<p>Contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) provide DPI with manufacturing, pharmacology, toxicology, regulatory, and clinical operations services to assist with drug development. Planning and execution of each individual drug development program includes identification of scientific areas best suited for utilization of CROs and CMOs to conduct some or all parts of a given drug development program.</p>\r\n<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS</p>\r\n<p>NCATS Section <br />NIDA Office of Acquisition, NIH<br />6001 Executive Blvd<br />Suite 3287, MSC 9534<br />Bethesda, MD 20892-9534 <em>*</em></p>\r\n<p><em>* Use Rockville, MD 20852 for FedEx/USPS/Courier/Hand Delivery</em></p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/NIDA-01/N01TR-19-2007/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"1212","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Health and Human Services","OFFICE":"Program Support Center","LOCATION":"Acquisition Management Services","ZIP":"20857","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"541715","OFFADD":"7700 Wisconsin Ave Bethesda MD 20857","SUBJECT":"EPA High-Throughput Toxiconketics","SOLNBR":"19-233-SOL-00044","RESPDATE":"012219","CONTACT":"Jimmy Nguyen, Contracts Specialist, Phone 3014430043, Email jimmy.nguyen@psc.hhs.gov","DESC":"<span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;\">The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC)</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"> is issuing this solicitation for the purpose of entering into an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract.

No response is required at this time.<br /><br />The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this pre-announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) focused on the development of a pharmacotherapy (i.e., drug treatment) for the acute management and prophylactic treatment of deep partial-thickness (DPT) burn wounds that is conducive to operations in combat theatre as well as fixed medical facilities. The Government seeks to rapidly advance the development of prototype drug therapy treatment(s) to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in DPT burn-injured patients to enhance recovery, improve outcomes, and limit scarring.\r\n<p>Technical Objective:<br />The current standard of care for DPT-burn injury remains supportive in nature, based on management of symptoms, with no prophylactic and drug therapies that address the scarring. Despite numerous clinical trials on potential therapies, no drug is approved by the FDA for the prophylaxis or treatment of wound scarring. DPT-burn injury is associated with significant long-term morbidity requiring costly corrective surgeries. Up to $7.5 billion is spent annually on treatment of burns in the United States, and much of this cost is related to treatment of the resulting scar and contracture (Marshall et al., 2018, PMID: 29392092}. Therefore, it is important to develop a therapy that will mitigate the life-long disability and rehabilitation costs associated with these post-injury conditions.</p>\r\n<p>The United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) has developed a novel anti-scarring therapy and demonstrated proof-of-concept in murine and swine models of DPT thermal burn. Additional information regarding this novel anti-scarring drug will be provided in the upcoming RPP. MTEC is seeking a team to accomplish the strategizing, planning, and implementation of manufacturing, IND-enabling studies, and early phase 0/1 clinical trials of this anti-scarring drug prototype developed by the USAISR.</p>\r\n<p>Offerors should propose against the following technical needs and are encouraged to bring partnerships to their proposals to meet these needs. Infrastructure shall not require funding for standup. The Offeror's team shall be led by a centralized point of contact that integrates multiple partners and the Government Steering Committee (GSC) in a comprehensive strategy for accomplishing the work. <br />1) Technical need for expertise in selecting dosage formulation (e.g., emulsion, film) and manufacturing of topical drug products; IND-enabling studies, including strategy, planning, and execution; chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC); and, clinical strategy and protocol development and implementation of early clinical trials (Phase 0 and/or Phase 1) for wound healing treatments, including patient recruitment, clinical trial data management, interactions with FDA for regulatory compliance - for assessing safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy. <br />2) Existing clinical trial centers with a proven history of burn-wound patient recruitment and integration of Contract Resource Organization, with infrastructure already in place with no funding needed for standup.<br />3) Team of subject matter experts that shall produce and design standardized, exploratory and adaptive studies to answer, dose, duration of treatment, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) status of the drug prototype(s) in wound-injured subjects. <br />4) Determine evaluation criteria and strategy (cost, schedule, feasibility, pre-clinical data analysis, etc.) for the entire advanced development after dose-ranging animal studies and up to and including Phase 0, 1, and/or Phase 2 clinical trials. <br />5) Determine and defend study design concepts for anti-scar drugs including type of wounds and dosage, methods for analysis, and population enrichment. <br />6) Describe and determine criteria for moving promising anti-scar drug therapy prototypes further into advanced development.<br />7) Determine strategy and manage relationships among partners including non-disclosure agreements, intellectual property rights, regulatory sponsorship and strategy, indications for use, anticipated or known side effects with current standard of care for wounds, and regulatory milestones for FDA approval.<br />8) Determine evaluation criteria and strategy for anti-scar treatment manufacturing timeline and costs, methods to ensure Good Manufacturing Processes, product quality assurance and testing, strategy for initial manufacturing lots for clinical trial testing, long term manufacturing and sustainment. <br />The end-goal of the work funded by this upcoming RPP is the completion of a Phase 0/1 clinical trial.</p>\r\n<p>Potential Funding Availability:<br />The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently has available approximately $2 Million (M) for this effort. A period of performance of up to 4 years is allowable, but a faster timeline is acceptable. It is expected that MTEC will make a single award to a qualified team to accomplish all tasks. <br />Acquisition Strategy:<br />The MTEC will use a streamlined, accelerated approach for this acquisition. This approach will consist of the following steps:</p>\r\n<p>Step 1: MTEC members who wish to offer a solution to the RPP must submit a Solutions Brief. The Solutions Brief will contain the MTEC Offeror's technical concept and approach along with their viability toward the specific effort. To meet the statutory requirement of the Other Transaction Authority, Offeror Solutions Briefs will also have to address the significant participation of a Nontraditional Defense Contractor or Nonprofit Research Organization on the team or the willingness to provide 1/3 cost share to the project. The Offeror will also be expected to present a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule.</p>\r\n<p>Step 2: As part of the Government review of the Solutions Brief, MTEC members who have submitted a favorable Solutions Brief based on the RPP criteria may be invited to present and discuss their solution with the Government sponsors for the research via a virtual or in-person \"pitch\" of the proposed project along with a SOW/Milestone Payment Schedule and cost information.</p>\r\n<p>Step 3: MTEC Offeror(s) will be notified of the down select recommendation(s), and if selected, will be invited to submit a detailed Cost Proposal in accordance with the MTEC Proposal Preparation Guide (PPG).</p>\r\n<p>Because of the nature of the requirements set forth in the forthcoming RPP, this streamlined, interactive approach is anticipated to be a better means to highlight company methodologies and skills and allow the government to gain a fuller appreciation of the work required to be completed. It provides more freedom and initiative to the Offeror to describe how they would approach and solve such an action. The full description of this contracting approach will be included in the RPP.</p>\r\n<p>MTEC:<br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and supporting the transition of medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA).

The NextSTEP-2 BAA contract vehicle requires corporate resource contributions for R&amp;D-type activities, including maturing unique technologies.</div>\r\n<div><br />This BAA Appendix addresses the development of human lunar landing capabilities. NASA is planning three demonstration missions to the lunar surface, with the first crewed human lunar landing targeted for the third mission.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp; <br />This NextSTEP-2 Appendix E will include a NASA reference human lander architecture configuration. The full architecture will include a Descent Element, Ascent Element, Transfer Vehicle, Refueling Element, and Surface Suit. NASA plans to launch the first demonstration mission in 2024. The minimum objective of this mission is to demonstrate a lunar surface landing with one or more Descent Elements capable of supporting a future human lander that includes both Descent Element and Ascent Element. Contracts awarded under Appendix E may have multiple phases. The first will be for brief studies to mature requirements, tailor applicable standards, procure long-lead parts and implement technology maturation plans for early risk reduction. Following the study, NASA intends to execute future phases that may result in multiple awards, for the Design, Development, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&amp;E) and flight demonstrations of Descent Elements. NASA is still considering acquisition options for other human lunar lander system Elements. The detailed study requirements and additional information on the overall acquisition strategy will be contained in the forthcoming Appendix E solicitation.</div>\r\n<div><br />NASA will use the information gained through these initial studies to inform the performance requirements for the human lander system and will work with industry to continue to mature the approach for future missions.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp; <br />The Point of Contact for technical and programmatic questions on this synopsis is Dr. Greg Chavers, NASA HQ Advanced Exploration Systems Division at <strong>HQ-NextSTEP-BAA@mail.nasa.gov</strong>.</div>\r\n<div><br />Submission information, participant eligibility, additional topic information and specific evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be identified in Appendix E when it is released.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<div><br /></div>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/49ada55b3e532f7cb2cfe04b126f0ee0","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"1214","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Other Defense Agencies","OFFICE":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","LOCATION":"Contracts Management Office","ZIP":"22203","CLASSCOD":"A","NAICS":"541714","OFFADD":"675 North Randolph Street <br> Arlington, VA 22203","SUBJECT":"Maritime Materials Technology","SOLNBR":"HR001119S0011","RESPDATE":"040419","ARCHDATE":"05042019","CONTACT":"BAA Coordinator\n\n<a href=\"mailto:M2T@darpa.mil\">M2T@darpa.mil</a>","DESC":"DARPA seeks expertise in biomimetic chemistry and lifecycle biology of r-selected marine organisms.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/HR001119S0011/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"M2T@darpa.mil","DESC3":"M2T@darpa.mil","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"1214","YEAR":"18","AGENCY":"Department of Transportation","OFFICE":"Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)","LOCATION":"Headquarters","ZIP":"20591","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"561110","OFFADD":"FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, AAQ-420 WA - FAA Headquarters (Washington, DC)","SUBJECT":"APL Administrative and Technical Support","SOLNBR":"32145","RESPDATE":"010219","ARCHDATE":"01022019","CONTACT":"lakeisha Wiley-Bess, lakeisha.wiley-bess@faa.gov, Phone: 202-267-7694\n\n<a href=\"mailto:lakeisha.wiley-bess@faa.gov\">Click here to email lakeisha Wiley-Bess</a>","DESC":"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of Policy, International Affairs, and Environment (APL), contemplates issuing a screening information request (SIR) in order to meet the requirement for expert administrative and technical support services.\nAPL is the agency lead for Aviation Policy, International Aviation, and Environmental issues.

Specifically, assist the DOT in evaluating and determining whether or not to participate in such facilities (if we are able to).</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Assist in the preparation of all presentations and briefings to DOT leadership including any and all proposals and recommendations for approval regarding debt and capital restructuring negotiations and positions, participation in \"new money\" facilities, exit scenarios such as sale of our debt and/or equity positions, sale of the entire project, etc.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Analyze and evaluate the existing financial model provided by the borrower and/or sponsors and then assist in development of new models, if needed, during any restructuring or bankruptcy situations as well as conducting sensitivity analyses during each stage of negotiations. Assess the project's debt capacity and adequacy of capital/equity structures needed to successfully emerge from any restructuring or bankruptcy process.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Work closely with internal and external legal counsel (including the DOJ in any bankruptcy proceeding or other litigation) in reviewing existing project documentation (loan agreements, indentures, concession agreements, collateral agency and inter-creditor agreements) as well as work on all documentation tasks in pre-petition bankruptcy, Chapter 11/ bankruptcy and post-emergence situations such as: debt and capital restructuring proposals and term sheets; collateral and inter-creditor issues and documents; DOT's voting rights and pre-petition claims in Chapter 11/bankruptcy proceedings; Chapter 11 Plans of Reorganization (\"PORs\"); term sheets and documents for any new money facilities DOT may consider participating in; new equity structures for the project (such as new holding company/LLC Agreements; Concession Agreement modifications.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Assist in evaluating, negotiating and implementing any and all exit strategies that could involve: sale of pre-petition debt; liquidation of project collateral or assessment of new collateral to be provided; sale of equity (if our debt has been converted to equity in the project); sale of the project itself, most likely in a post-bankruptcy emergence situation. One particularly important task is to provide updated enterprise value assessments of the project in question using methodologies such as EBITDA multiples, DCF projections and sales/market comps (if available).</p>\r\n<p>&bull; In a post-bankruptcy emergence scenario, assist in evaluating the project company's revised performance and revenue forecasts and financial model (and if necessary, assist in preparation of such), debt and capital structure, management capability (this may also include assessment of whether or not a Chief Restructuring Officer is needed). This may also entail assisting with initial management, operational and financial decisions that need to be made if DOT emerges as an equity stakeholder and member of any new Board of Directors.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Provide advisory services regarding a refinancing of senior debt or extension of new debt in a project that possibly entails: changes to material terms including but not limited to re-levering the company, stretching and changing amortization schedules, funds flow waterfalls, mandatory prepayments, cash sweeps, etc. that could impact the DOT's position. This may also require analysis of any impact this has on the underlying TIFIA/RRIF loan agreements, preparation of new projections and sensitivities, and working closely with internal and external legal counsel on any changes to replacement of collateral agency agreements, inter-creditor agreements, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Task Area B - Other Bureau Matters</p>\r\n<p>The Contractor shall, as authorized in task orders:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Attend meetings in Washington, D.C.

Select \"Utilizing Public-Private Partnerships to Advance Tipping Point Technologies 80HQTR19NOA01-19STMD_001\" <br /> <br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) continues to embrace public-private partnerships to achieve its strategic goals for expanding capabilities and opportunities in space. A key aspect of NASA's strategy is to stimulate the commercial space industry and commercial capabilities through public-private partnerships to deliver technologies and capabilities needed for future NASA, other government agency, and commercial missions. With the recent increase of U.S. private sector companies interested in space applications, NASA is seeking commercial space technologies that are at a \"tipping point\" in their development cycle. The anticipated definition to be used for the purpose of this Appendix is that a space technology is at a \"tipping point\" if:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;\tan investment in a ground demonstration or flight demonstration will result in:<br />o\ta significant advancement of the technology's maturation, and<br />o\ta significant improvement in the offerors' ability to successfully bring the space technology to market, and<br />&bull;\tthere is clear evidence of previous investments in maturing the technology (e.g., venture capital, corporate investment, etc.) indicating a pre-existing plan to commercialize the technology, and<br />&bull;\tthe technology is at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 4 at time of proposal submission.</p>\r\n<p>This Appendix is seeking U.S. for-profit industry led proposals to advance \"tipping point\" space technologies, executed through firm-fixed-price contracts with milestone payments. See Appendix section 3.0 for the full list of eligibility requirements/ restrictions. The award instrument will be a firm-fixed-price contract with milestone payments tied to technical achievement. All awards will require an Industry Contribution of <strong>at least 25%</strong> (10% for U.S. for-profit entities that have 500 or less employees) of the Total Project Cost and must be met during the potential awarded contract period of performance. It is anticipated that firm-fixed-price contracts will be awarded.</p>\r\n<p>This release anticipates soliciting tipping point technologies from the following Topics. This list should be considered preliminary and is subject to change prior to solicitation release.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cryogenic Propellant Conversion and Management</strong>: Demonstrate systems for converting and liquifying hydrogen and oxygen from water, capable of scaling to tens of metric tons per month, operating with little to no human involvement in space or on the lunar surface; Demonstrate technologies enabling autonomous transfer and storage of cryogenic hydrogen, capable of scaling to tens of metric tons, with negligible losses for at least a year in space and on the lunar surface.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sustainable Energy Generation, Storage, and Transfer</strong>: Demonstrate technologies to enable continuous power throughout the lunar day and night and capable of scaling to tens of kilowatts for long-term surface operations and thermal management systems to maintain lunar surface system operating temperatures within desired bounds throughout the lunar day/night cycle.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Efficient and Affordable Propulsion Systems</strong>: Fully integrated system level solutions are sought exhibiting power, size, and mass characteristics suitable for small spacecraft applications in the 60kg to 200kg range. Propulsion systems that have modularity or that can support combining multiple thrusters for utilization on a broader range of spacecraft sizes, including CubeSats or larger ESPA class spacecraft, would also be of interest. While the emphasis is on small spacecraft below 200kg, this does not preclude interest in propulsion systems for larger spacecraft that can be launched as secondary payloads, if there are identified commercial needs for such systems.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Capabilities needed for Exploration</strong>: NASA is interested in Tipping Point proposals to enable the following capabilities for the Exploration Campaign and commercial space:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;\tAutonomous Operations<br />&bull;\tRover Mobility<br />&bull;\tPrecision Landing<br />&bull;\tAdvanced Avionics (e.g., radiation hardened; affordable)</p>\r\n<p>Proposed efforts to this Appendix must be led by a United States of America (U.S.) for-profit entity.

No response is required at this time.<br /><br />The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this pre-announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) focused on the development of a bacteriophage prototype for the treatment of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections employing a tailored, precision approach. The overall end goal of the program is a commercial bacteriophage product that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and suitable for use by the U.S. Military.\r\n<p>Technical Background:<br />Recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have seen a notable rise in the survival of combat casualties. These patients with anatomically complex wounds and extended, invasive treatment regimens are vulnerable to combat extremity wound infections. Furthermore, those infections are often clinically complicated or multidrug resistant and thus difficult to treat effectively. The bacterial species responsible for these types of infections often include the group called &lsquo;ESKAPE' pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp), which cause the majority of infections within the nosocomial environment and are noted for prevalence of antibiotic resistance.</p>\r\n<p>Multidrug antibiotic resistance is an emerging medical challenge that is reaching crisis proportions. Existing antimicrobials are losing their efficacy, and the drug development pipeline for traditional small molecule antimicrobials (antibiotics) is limited in new alternative candidates. One alternative to traditional antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections is bacteriophage therapy.</p>\r\n<p>Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that specifically attack bacteria. Since their discovery a century ago, phages have been contemplated as potential therapeutic agents. However, the immature science of bacteriophage microbiology at the time, followed by the discovery and development of conventional antibiotics, diverted attention from bacteriophages. Now with the growing failure of antibiotics, bacteriophages are being reconsidered as therapeutic agents.</p>\r\n<p>One key feature of bacteriophages is their host specificity. Any given bacteriophage typically will infect only a single species of bacteria, and indeed often has a restricted host range within that species, where naturally occurring genetic diversity of the host limits the bacteriophage to a subset of bacterial strains. Furthermore, it is common in a susceptible bacterial population for genetic variants to occur that gain resistance to the bacteriophage. These two points can significantly constrain the efficacy of a bacteriophage therapeutic: a single bacteriophage or defined combination of bacteriophages is unlikely to work against all clinically presented infections, and infections against which a bacteriophage therapeutic might initially be effective can ultimately overcome treatment through the emergence of a resistant subclone.</p>\r\n<p>This program seeks to overcome both these failure points by using a precision medicine approach to delivering bacteriophage therapy. It should be possible to overcome both the genetic diversity of bacterial clinical pathogens and the selection for phage-resistant variants in the course of treatment using individualized phage therapeutics on a case by case basis. With a successful precision strategy, bacteriophage therapy may be an open-ended solution to the treatment of bacterial infections.</p>\r\n<p>This precision medicine approach to bacteriophage therapeutics does face a challenging product development and production pathway. Given the complexity of phages themselves and the inherent novelty of precision therapeutic approaches, Pharmaceutical Quality/Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) will entail demanding characterization and production procedures. The regulatory environment for licensure of a precision phage product is incompletely defined and as yet untested. The logistics of case-by-case design of a precision phage therapeutic and delivery to bedside in a clinically useful timeframe needs to be established. The prototyping effort sought here is intended to help resolve all these aspects of the clinical development of precision bacteriophage therapeutics for antimicrobial applications.</p>\r\n<p>Program Description:<br />The goal of this program is to support the Research, Development, Test and Engineering (RDT&amp;E) activities required for the clinical development of a precision bacteriophage therapeutic. The ultimate objective is to support submission of a BLA for FDA approval. The successful offeror will include in their proposal a realistic regulatory strategy and development framework for reaching that objective.<br /><br />Project Deliverables<br />This MTEC RPP focuses on the execution of clinical trial(s) for the treatment of complicated or MDR bacterial infections, treating appropriate ESKAPE infection indication(s) to most effectively advance a precision bacteriophage product toward FDA licensure.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of this MTEC award is to evaluate human safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage prototype for treatment of MDR infections. Examples of bacterial infection diagnoses relevant for testing of bacteriophage therapy include asymptomatic bacteriuria, symptomatic refractory MDR genitourinary (GU) infections, and potentially other clinically relevant infections suitable to support development and evaluation of precision phage interventions for complicated and MDR bacterial infections.</p>\r\n<p>This program's first Task seeks to test precision bacteriophage therapy using a suitable clinical indication that will maximize the probability of assessing efficacy. The Government may pursue optional follow-on tasks to continue product development through additional clinical trials for relevant FDA marketing approval/licensure. The intent of this prototyping effort is to secure a development partner to complete all requisite FDA-compliant manufacturing and packaging development, complete the Phase 1 / 2 clinical trials (2) (Task 1 and options, as denoted below), conduct Phase 2 clinical trials (option), conduct Phase 3 clinical trial(s) (option), and to complete all other developmental requirements to support a BLA application to FDA to ultimately support FDA licensure.</p>\r\n<p>Offerors, as the regulatory sponsor for the eventual submission to FDA, will be expected to conduct all manner of development, test and evaluation activities (as necessary) to achieve an FDA-licensed precision bacteriophage product that is suitable for use by the U.S. Military. It is expected that the Offeror will work in close coordination with the DoD, and is encouraged to partner with medical treatment facility(ies) such as the Veteran's Administration and/or Department of Defense (DoD) medical facilities for the conduct of the clinical trial. The Offeror shall identify any proposed U.S. Government (USG) or DoD partner medical treatment facilities, if a Government facility is proposed to be used in the performance of this proposed effect.</p>\r\n<p>The full spectrum of work is expected to be conducted in several tasks over a minimum of a 6 year period of performance (PoP), as follows. Task 1 is the basis for the upcoming award but Tasks 2, 3, and 4 may be added as follow-on work dependent on the technical progress and/or outcome of Task 1, and therefore, may be of interest to potential Offerors. Potential Offerors are expected to propose a clinical trial in response to Task 1, only, and to include in their proposal a realistic regulatory strategy and development framework for ultimate BLA approval of a precision bacteriophage therapeutic that would encompass the follow-on Tasks 2-4 (or equivalent).</p>\r\n<p>Task 1 (PoP up to 2 years): Conduct Phase 1 / 2 clinical trial(s) for MDR ESKAPE pathogen infections as a part of a full-spectrum FDA-compliant clinical development to support a BLA submission to FDA. Task 1 is expected to be completed within two (2) years. Proposals may request support for Task 1 that includes, but is not limited to, subject matter expertise, appropriate consultation for regulatory strategy, and ensuring reproducibility of the manufacturing process at scale for the ultimate fielding of the innovative biologic bacteriophage product to DoD stakeholders and to commercial market. Anticipated Task 1 activities include (but are not limited to): <br />&bull; Manufacture (cGMP) of bacteriophage therapeutic product suitable for clinical investigation in Phase 1 / 2 clinical trials; <br />&bull; Conception and execution of appropriate regulatory strategy (e.g., submission of Investigational New Drug [IND] application and other FDA-compliant responsibilities); conduct of Phase 1 / 2 clinical trial as the regulatory sponsor; accordingly, the development partner bears the legal responsibilities of sponsor under 21 CFR 312 Subpart D. <br />&bull; Establishment and management of clinical trial sites; <br />&bull; Enrollment and clinical monitoring at all enrollment sites; <br />&bull; Provisions of all aspects of data configuration, data management, analysis, and reporting in compliance with all applicable regulatory guidance and Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs).</p>\r\n<p>Potential Follow-on Task 2: Prepare for and conduct additional FDA compliant Phase 1 / 2 clinical trial(s).</p>\r\n<p>Potential Follow-on Task 3: Prepare for and conduct FDA compliant Phase 2 clinical trial(s).</p>\r\n<p>Potential Follow-on Task 4: Prepare for and conduct FDA compliant Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and submission of BLA for FDA licensure.</p>\r\n<p>Potential Funding Availability:<br />The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently has available approximately $2 Million (M) for the first Task of this effort. The Period of Performance (PoP) is 24 months for Task 1. Dependent on the results and deliverables from Task 1, additional time may be added to the period of performance for follow-on tasks.</p>\r\n<p>It is expected that MTEC will make a single award to a qualified team to accomplish all tasks. The program shall be led by a centralized point of contact at the prime contracting organization. If a single proposal is unable to sufficiently address the entire scope of this RPP's objectives, several Offerors may be asked to work together in a collaborative manner.</p>\r\n<p>Other Information:<br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and supporting life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations.

Additionally, global actors, both state and non-state, are using the same interactive internet system to plan and coordinate activities across the spectrum of operations. Essentially, the internet has become a ubiquitous Command and Control (C2) and sensor system that impacts the United States (US) and its allies' missions around the globe, including Shaping activities, force protection, counter-terrorism, counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), and a myriad of others. <br /><br />In response, the Government has established the Secure Unclassified Network (SUNet): an off-Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN), For Official Use Only (FOUO)-accredited unclassified platform to enable the Department of Defense (DoD), US Government Interagency, and Coalition Partners to securely collaborate and share Publicly Available Information, FOUO data, analytics, and other enterprise services. This platform enables mission partners to establish virtual enclaves, control access to those enclaves, and to acquire, develop, and deploy mission-specific data sets and analytics that can be shared across multiple enclaves or restricted based on mission requirements.<br /><br />The objective of this effort is to manage, develop, enhance, integrate, test, deploy, and maintain the SUNet system infrastructure, as well as develop and implement SUNet enclaves for mission-specific requirements utilizing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) products with new data and collaboration features across US Government and foreign partner communities of interest.

The CIRB uses an independent model of IRB review where a local institution and principal investigators inform the CIRB about local context considerations, including local laws and requirements, via the submission of annual worksheets.

To be eligible for consideration, parties wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the instructions on the website, no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 7, 2019. No electronic mail, faxed, or hard copy proposals will be accepted.</p>\r\n<p>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. It is the sole responsibility of the offerors to make certain the proposal is properly received by ESTCP. Awards will take the form of contracts. Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals or travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals.</p>\r\n<p>There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $12 million will result, depending on availability of funds.</p>\r\n<p>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by ESTCP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether ESTCP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions located on the ESTCP website, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Cost/Benefit of Technology, Transition Potential, and Cost of Proposal. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, the Government will not provide debriefs to those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.</p>\r\n<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 541715 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 1000 employees and $15.0M respectively. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $700,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 (Deviation) and elements as described in the checklist in DFARS PGI 219.705-4 at http://business.defense.gov/Acquisition/Subcontracting/.

NIDA is seeking systems for data management, statistical support, document management and clinical trial services. The systems will be used to support clinical data capture, data analysis, information exchange, scientific discovery efforts and clinical evaluation of promising new drug abuse treatment interventions in order to further NIDA's mission.<br /><br />NIDA's National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) conducts single and multi-site clinical trials through grants, contracts and cooperative agreements in sites located across the nation and in other countries. These are usually studies of behavioral, pharmacological, and integrated behavioral and pharmacological treatment interventions in rigorous, clinical trials to determine efficacy, effectiveness, practicality, and feasibility across a broad range of treatment settings and diversified patient populations and to transfer research results to physicians, clinicians, providers, and patients. In support of efforts to address the national opioid public health crisis, the CTN plans a significant expansion of its opioid research portfolio. Development and implementation of studies to improve access to high-quality addiction treatment, for example, by facilitating delivery of opioid use disorder treatment in general medical settings is expected. These studies could be Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and/or Phase IV type trials. They may also include registry type trials or surveys.<br /><br />Although no actual clinical trials will be conducted under this requirement, the project activities will support NIDA trials in the following technical areas:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Establish and administer state-of-the-art, secured web-based systems for the collection, storage, management, quality assurance, and reporting of study data as well as systems to facilitate the collection and management of participant and site level electronic health records data.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Assist in the design and analysis of clinical trials, including the development of the statistical sections of protocols, study design, randomization and stratification methods, power and sample size calculations, interim monitoring and analysis plans, and data analytic plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Review and monitor the quality of study data including the development and management of a computerized data monitoring system that executes quality assurance and quality control procedures to evaluate accuracy, timeliness and completeness of data submitted by the clinical sites, including verification of the clinical and laboratory data used to determine that study participants have reached protocol-defined endpoints.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Monitor trial performance and progress and maintain a secure web-based clinical trial performance monitoring system to track key trial performance metrics (e.g. key dates, recruitment, availability of primary outcomes, missing data, etc.). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Coordinate meetings of study Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) to include the preparation and presentation of reports on safety, data integrity, and site performance as well as coordination of meeting sites, materials, travel support, etc.).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Participate in relevant committee and subcommittee meetings including representation by the contract Principal Investigator on the CTN Steering Committee and representation by other senior data and statistical experts on other relevant CTN committees, subcommittees and workgroups.<br /><br />NIDA anticipates that one (1) indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), task order contract will be awarded for a period of performance of three (3) years. NIDA may award either cost reimbursement and/or fixed price task orders under this contract. These individual task orders may include options and/or options quantities. If options or option quantities are utilized for an individual task order, it&nbsp;will be clearly defined in the Task Order RFP and be determined and evaluated at the time of task order solicitation and award. NIDA anticipates that at least one task order will be awarded with the contract. Future funding will be made through issuances of task orders and will be dependent on NIDA programmatic needs and availability of funds. Various task orders will be issued to support distinct tasks and studies which will separately support the CTN and the NIH launched HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative.<br /><br />RFP No. 75N95019R00016 will be available electronically on or about January 26, 2019.&nbsp;The RFP can be accessed through the FBO.gov or through the NIDA website: (URL: https://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract-proposals-rfps).

THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) NUMBER NIH-NINDS-75N95019R00027, ENTITLED: \"Screening of Investigational Agents through the NINDS PRECLINICAL SCREENING PLATFORM FOR PAIN (PSPP)\" WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT February 14, 2019.<br /><br />The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is establishing the Preclinical Screening Platform for Pain (PSPP) in response to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative. The HEAL initiative (https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative) is a trans-NIH effort to fast-track basic, translational, and clinical research in the field of addiction and pain to address the national opioid crisis. The goal of the PSPP is to foster the development of opioid alternatives to treat all types of pain conditions.<br /><br />As part of this HEAL Initiative, the PSPP will provide pain researchers from the academic and industry community with a centralized resource for testing compounds, biologics, natural products, and devices for their potential as opioid alternatives. Contributors with a promising non-addictive therapeutic for pain (Contributors) will be invited to submit bioactive investigational agents to the PSPP for testing. These investigational agents will be evaluated to determine if they are non-opiate, metabolically stable compounds that show promise in established and newly developed models of pain.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide screening of potentially viable investigational agents submitted through the PSPP. NINDS will send investigational agents to the Contractor in a blinded fashion (without structures), and the Contractor shall perform progressive testing funnel established in collaboration with NINDS staff and the External Consultants Board for the PSPP (ECB.) The testing will include in-vitro evaluation, including opioid receptor activity, followed by testing in a series of acute and chronic pain models. Selected testing models of tolerability and/or side effect liability shall also be performed to determine therapeutic index. Additional testing in models of abuse liability shall also be investigated to evaluate the test agents for addictive potential.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide resources and expertise in not only the execution of existing models available in the labs presently but also in establishing new in-vivo pain models to create a standardized panel of preclinical pain models and behavioral tests that shall be used to evaluate potential efficacy as well as the side effects and abuse liability of Contributor-submitted investigational agents. The Contractor shall evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, side effects and abuse liability of new investigational agents, perform in-vitro pharmacological profiling and determine target selectivity, execute formulation research studies and establish Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) profiles of candidate agents submitted to the NINDS by Contributors. The Contractor in their own facilities or through subcontractors shall also provide the complete array of in-vitro and in-vivo assays to evaluate the potential side effects (in-vitro and in-vivo), drug abuse liability, in-vitro pharmacological profiling and target selectivity, ADME (in-vitro and in-vivo) profiling, formulation research studies and pharmacokinetic studies of the investigational agents.<br /><br />The goal of the NIH programs served by this contract is to bring new drugs to the market. To this end, the NIH has been granted a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) for this contract. The DEC enables the Contributors to retain control of the intellectual property for investigational agents evaluated through the PSPP.<br /><br />The Contractor shall be required to demonstrate a platform of a wide-range of established and validated models of pain conditions and in-house expertise for testing new investigational agents and devices in models of pain conditions. The Contractor shall provide a platform of in-vivo testing in models to cover the broad spectrum of pain conditions to measure efficacy, abuse liability and sensory or motor side effects of investigational agents (small molecules, biologics, natural products, and devices). The Contractor shall also demonstrate capabilities in the areas of supportive in-vitro pharmacological screening against opioid receptors and other molecular targets associated with off-target effects, ADME profiling, formulation research and pharmacokinetic and bioanalytical studies (in animal model species) in establish exposures in the proposed efficacy studies. Evaluation of new investigational agents will be conducted under the following three performance areas: <br /><br />1) In-vivo testing in pain conditions, abuse liability and side effects assessment models including supporting studies or establishing new pain-related models to support the evolving requirements of the PSPP as needed;<br /><br />2) In-vitro pharmacological profiling against opioid receptors and/or other molecular target(s) of safety; and<br /><br />3) ADME and formulation studies as well as pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment and bioanalytical testing of samples. <br /><br />Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed, to conduct services in the following Performance Areas.<br /><br />Performance Area 1: In-vivo testing in pain conditions, abuse liability and side effects models<br /><br />Performance Area 2: In-vitro pharmacological profiling<br /><br />Performance Area 3: ADME and formulation studies as well as PK assessment and bioanalytical testing of samples<br /><br />The NINDS anticipates awarding one (1) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract under this program with a five-year ordering period to allow for the issuance of level of effort and completion type cost-reimbursement task orders. It is also anticipated that the IDIQ award will be made in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2019.<br /><br />Offerors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) when submitting an offer or quotation, and shall continue to be registered until time of award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from a solicitation.<br /><br />Processing time should be taken into consideration when registering.

Historically each year, the NIAC Program competitively selects Phase I and Phase II awards. Phase I studies are nine-month efforts to explore the overall viability and advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of visionary aerospace concepts. A follow-on Phase II study to eligible recipients of Phase I awards develops the most promising Phase I concepts for up to two years and explores transition paths within NASA and beyond. Phase II studies are designed to prepare a roadmap for further development, but are not expected to fully advance the technologies to a level required for program or commercial transition. NIAC Phase III studies are designed to strategically transition NIAC concepts with the highest potential impact to other NASA programs, other government agencies, or commercial partners.</p>\r\n<p>NIAC Phase III incorporates a two-step proposal and evaluation process, where Step 1 is a mandatory Notice of Intent (NOI). The aerospace concept and mission context with which the proposal aligns must be clearly identified by the offeror. Once the technical evaluation of the NOI is complete, NIAC will consider programmatic considerations such as portfolio balancing, costs, and other programmatic considerations, in order to determine the most competitive NOIs to be invited to submit a Full Proposal. An offeror must submit an NOI and be invited to submit a Full Proposal; unsolicited proposals will not be considered. NOI submissions, invitations to submit a Full Proposal, and award selections will be announced via NSPIRES.</p>\r\n<p>For this current Phase III solicitation, and it is anticipated for the year after, NIAC will consider proposals based on current and completed NIAC Phase II studies; successful Phase II studies completed under the predecessor NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts; and studies from proposers who have performed essentially equivalent work, as eligible for the Phase III award. In this context, essentially equivalent work is defined as a successfully completed study that is documented in a publicly accessible final report, which was performed under government, industry, non-profit or academic institution funding in an aerospace research area that closely aligns with the NIAC goals and objectives defined in the NIAC Phase III Solicitation Document. Appendix will have final eligibility requirements. Beyond FY2021, it is anticipated that NIAC will only consider active second year NIAC Phase II awards as eligible for Phase III award.</p>\r\n<p>NIAC Principal Investigators (PIs) and team members may be affiliated with any educational institution, commercial or not-for-profit organization, research laboratory, agency, or NASA Center (including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory). Teaming by non-<br />U.S. organizations in proposed efforts is permitted but subject to NASA's policy on foreign participation (see Section 3.3 of the NRA).</p>\r\n<p>Appendix 80HQTR19NOA01_19NIAC-A3 seeks NIAC Phase III awards that will continue the exploration and development of revolutionary advanced concepts that have advanced to a NIAC Phase II or essentially equivalent level of development, with a plausible path for implementation into NASA missions or other government agency and industry aerospace programs. Phase II studies extend, refine, and build upon the basic feasibility and potential benefit of early stage Phase I concepts, defining key enabling technologies and addressing critical unknowns, assumptions, risks, and paths forward. Phase III studies advance the most promising concepts to a level suitable for transition into other NASA programs, other government agencies, or commercial partners by demonstrating key technology components, subsystems or systems and establishing a viable path toward implementation. Phase III studies define major technical milestones, establish the cost and schedule to accomplish these key milestones, and implement a strategy to transition the technology for further development and utilization.</p>\r\n<p>Notices of Intent and Full Proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES by an authorized organizational representative (AOR).

No response is required at this time</span></strong>\r\n<p>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this <strong>pre-announcement </strong>for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) <strong>focused on developing scalable, production-ready, commercial prototypes and processes for cell, tissue, or organ bioengineering technologies that will overcome current challenges and enable successful current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and clinical translation of regenerative medicine based therapies.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Technology Focus Areas<br /></span></strong>The Joint Program Committee (JPC)-8/Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program (CRMRP), the Defense Health Agency, Research, Development and Acquisition (DHA RDA), and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD(HA)) have identified a need for regenerative medicine prototype development efforts and manufacturing technologies. cGMP quality is a requirement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency to provide patients with clinical-grade products that are safe and have defined quality characteristics. However, standardization and robust manufacturing techniques are lacking in regenerative medicine, which will continue to impede progress in advancing regenerative medicine based technologies and treatments toward the clinic. This is likely due to many factors which need to be developed and advanced, including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) advancing bioreactor technology for cost-effective cell and tissue expansions, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) improving cell, tissue, and organ preservation technology, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) innovating and advancing large scale manufacturing and quality assurance for regenerative medicine based products, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) developing dynamic and innovative quality assurance strategies for regenerative medicine manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p><em>This upcoming RPP is a follow-on effort to MTEC's previous (2016) Regenerative Medicine Manufacturing RPP, where several technologies of interest were funded. This RPP focuses on the capability gaps that remain unfunded or underfunded by the DoD.</em></p>\r\n<p>Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Bioreactors to enable efficient and cost-effective cell and tissue expansion for regenerative medicine products<br /></strong>For many regenerative medicine therapies, millions of cells are required for each patient. The cell and tissue expansion phase of the manufacturing process is by far the most expensive and time consuming step, often requiring several months to reach economically-viable numbers of cells. There is a significant need for alternatives to flat plate culture technologies for efficient and cost-effective cell and tissue expansion. Areas of interest to enhance cell expansion for regenerative medicine products include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Non-invasive or minimally-invasive in-process technologies that can monitor key parameters of the expansion process, including but not limited to: cell viability, cell number, endotoxin content, mycoplasma<br />&bull; Non-destructive cell harvesting technologies<br />&bull; Single-use bioreactors for the scale-up of cells<br />&bull; Infrastructure to allow cell expansion to occur in parallel<br />&bull; Cell purification processes<br />&bull; Scale up the production of organoids for industrial use</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Cell, tissue, and product preservation for regenerative and personalized medicine</strong><br />Biobanking and biopreservation offers the possibility to preserve cells and tissue sources for future use. For regenerative and personalized medicine, these cells and tissues are later developed into products that need to be preserved to maintain activity during production, through manufacturing release, and ultimately to patient application. Therefore, there is a need to develop advanced, cost-effective technologies and processes for banking cells and tissues, and preserving regenerative medicine-based products to assist with shipping and distribution. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Novel preservation methods (e.g., non-cryogenic) that can be used on tissue engineered products during storage, shipping and distribution (including adverse environments such as austere conditions)<br />&bull; Advanced systems and processes for cell and tissue preservation, including specimen harvest, cell retrieval, and tissue-typing<br />&bull; Tests or methods to analyze or determine cell, tissue, or product viability/function following short-term and long-term storage</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Large scale manufacturing and quality assurance of regenerative medicine- based products</strong><br />Regenerative medicine products in early development are often fabricated using laboratory-based processes and lack defined product specifications. Therefore, the intent of this area of interest is to transfer these laboratory-based processes into scalable, production-ready, commercial manufacturing processes for cell, tissue, or organ bioengineering products with defined acceptance criteria. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Scalable, production-ready, commercial additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing for regenerative medicine applications<br />&bull; Automated tissue digestion systems<br />&bull; High throughput cell sorting technology<br />&bull; High throughout cell separation/isolation from media<br />&bull; Automated manufacturing processes for regenerative medicine products (scaffolds and/or bioactive molecules and/or cells)<br />&bull; Develop large scale systems capable of screening and engineering adult stem cells</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Dynamic and innovative quality assurance strategy for regenerative medicine manufacturing</strong><br />The identification and specification of standards and acceptance criteria are important for the regulatory approval of all implantable, manufactured products. Regenerative medicine-based products tend to have qualitative product acceptance criteria, which are difficult to standardize. Therefore, there is a need to develop and advance methods for quality assurance to assess process changes in regenerative medicine product manufacturing as well as in cell, tissue, and bioengineered organ product characteristics and function. Areas of interest to enhance the quality assurance strategy of regenerative medicine products include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Systems that can provide rapid batch testing for the evaluation of a production run<br />&bull; Automated and non-destructive imaging systems for inspection and characterization of tissue engineered products<br />&bull; Non-destructive in-process technologies that can monitor key parameters of the manufacturing process</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Potential Funding Availability</span></strong><br />The U.S. Government (USG) currently has available approximately $6 million (M) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. <br />Funds are intended to support areas of regenerative medicine manufacturing and prototyping that require development and harmonization into reproducible, consistent procedures which could stand the test of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.</p>\r\n<p>MTEC anticipates that 2 awards of $3M each (direct and indirect costs) will be made to qualified teams composed of teaming arrangements demonstrated to achieve advanced manufacturing and/or prototype development. <br />The Period of Performance (POP) is not to exceed four years.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Acquisition Approach</span></strong><br />This RPP will be conducted using a two-staged approach. In Stage 1, current MTEC members are invited to submit White Papers using the format contained in the RPP. The Government will evaluate White Papers submitted and will select White Papers that best meet their current technology priorities using the criteria specified in the RPP. Offerors whose technology solution is selected for further consideration based on White Paper evaluation will be invited to submit a proposal in Stage 2. Notification letters will contain specific Stage 2 proposal submission requirements.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Other Information</span></strong><br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and supporting effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations.

FSD's Financial Systems Division is responsible for managing a single, shared environment called the Legislative Branch Financial Management System (LBFMS). In 2009, Congress authorized the Library to operate the LBFMS and directed legislative branch agencies to migrate to the system. The US House of Representatives and the US Senate were not part of the directive to migrate to the LBFMS.</p>\r\n<p>The LBFMS financial system is CGI Federal's Momentum&reg; software, a web-based system used to manage financial and administrative operations. The LBFMS currently provides the financial system and selected financial services for the Library, the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC), the Office of Compliance (OOC), the Open World Leadership Center (OWLC), and the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP). Currently, the LBFMS supports approximately 600 Library users and 575 non-Library users. The LBFMS consists<br />of Momentum Financials Plus, Acquisitions Plus, Travel Accounting, Fixed Assets, Project Cost Accounting, Central Contracts File Connector, and Form and Content reporting. The system currently operates on Momentum ver 7.4, with software upgrades scheduled for every 2 to 3 years. The most recent upgrade was completed in July 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The LBFMS is currently hosted by CGI Federal in their FedRAMP cloud environment using an Oracle 12c database. The Library provides reporting functionality through the Financial Reporting System (FRS), used by the Library, CBO, OOC, MEDPAC and OWLC for financial and management reporting. FRS is an Oracle data warehouse updated daily with financial data and utilizes Business Objects for report distribution. FRS is hosted in the Library's data center.</p>\r\n<p>The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) maintains a data warehouse and performs its management reporting using Microsoft SSRS. AOC is in process of shutting down legacy systems Hyperion, Cognos and Qlik with conversion to a visualization reporting tool / Tableau.  AOC also maintains Maximo 7.6 and Maximo Anywhere for asset and inventory management as a shared service for AOC and USCP.  AOC's Maximo partition interfaces real-time with the financial system, while USCP's Maximo partition does not interface with the financial system. USCP uses a data warehouse called FinMart (MicroStrategy) for financial and management reporting, and uses Maximo for asset and inventory management. GAO developed an in-house reporting data warehouse called Financial System Analytics&nbsp;(FSA). It utilizes the Momentum built-in Business Intelligence and PentaHo, hosted at GAO. Maximo hosting and data warehouse hosting are in scope for this contract, however Maximo support and the reporting tool support are out of scope of services under the anticipated contract(s).</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Library and the LBFMS agencies have a requirement for ongoing contractor services to support the LBFMS. The government intends to award multiple contracts that can be used for orders placed by any Legislative Branch agency,</strong> although AOC maintains its own contract for system support with CGI through March 31, 2021 and may decide to use either contract to procure services. In addition, GAO's task order with CGI for support ends on October 30, 2021. Due to the possibility of different contractors supporting different agencies, we will require that all vendors pledge to work collaboratively and have coordination between agencies and other contractors.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Contract Type:</strong><br />The Library anticipates awarding <strong>up to four Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contracts</strong> from which Task Orders may be placed by authorized ordering agencies on a Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials, or Labor Hour basis.  <strong>Anticipated ordering period is ten years, commencing May 1, 2019.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Anticipated Solicitation Release and Award Dates:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Library anticipates releasing the solicitation on or around February 22, 2019</strong> with contracts being awarded on or around May 1, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>This pre-solicitation announcement does not obligate the Government to release a solicitation or award any contracts for this requirement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IDIQ Performance Areas:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Task Orders shall be issued under the anticipated multiple-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract(s) for  financial system hosting and support services to the Library and the legislative branch partners covering the following Performance Areas:  system hosting, application management services, help desk support (tiers 1, 2, and 3), upgrades/migration/enhancement/testing support, program management, IV&amp;V support, system training, documentation and system study support, software licensing and maintenance, transaction processing and financial management support, and business process reengineering support.</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/LOC/CS/CS/030ADV19R0012/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"US","POPADDRESS":"To be specified in each Task Order."}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"0208","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Department of Veterans Affairs","OFFICE":"VA Heartland Network","LOCATION":"Department of Veterans Affairs Heartland Network","ZIP":"66048","CLASSCOD":"D","NAICS":"541519","OFFADD":"Department of Veterans Affairs;Network Contracting Office (NCO) 15;3450 S 4th Street Trafficway;Leavenworth KS  66048","SUBJECT":"D--Web service,Strategic Planning service (VA-19-00014048)","SOLNBR":"36C25519Q0123","RESPDATE":"022219","ARCHDATE":"03242019","CONTACT":"MICHAEL P MURPHY\nCONTRACT SPECIALIST\n913-946-1991\n\n<a href=\"mailto:MICHAEL.MURPHY7@VA.GOV\">MICHAEL.MURPHY7@VA.GOV</a>","DESC":"To establish a firm-fixed price contract for Healthcare Strategic Planning Web Service accomplished as described in the statement of work (SOW).

The Government is already aware of prototype technologies submitted to previous MTEC solicitations, and therefore, such projects are not allowed to be resubmitted here. However, if you submitted a concept paper in response to the 18-08-Open Concepts Request for Project Information (RPI), you may resubmit your concept in response to this 19-08-MuLTI RPP if you believe that your technology specifically addresses at least one of the three MuLTI Focus Areas described below.]</em></p>\r\n<p>The MuLTI Focus Areas are: <br /><strong>Focus Area #1 - Prolonged Field Care and En Route Care (PFC/ERC):</strong> The PFC/ERC portfolio seeks to provide materiel and knowledge solutions to enable increased levels of care closer to the point of injury, including care provided during evacuation, to provide patient care for longer time periods when delayed evacuation exceeds available capability and/or capacity, and to extend provider capabilities in order to care for larger numbers of casualties.<br />Specific PFC/ERC areas of interest:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Advanced physiological monitoring capabilities that integrate with decision support tools to enable continuous feedback loops based on physiologic status and response to various treatments, including monitoring for secondary sequelae of trauma when evacuation is delayed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Automated splinting/traction systems to allow combat casualties to remain independently mobile despite extremity fracture or musculoskeletal injury<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Development of automated diagnostic systems that are field portable, do not require extensive interpretation by medical providers, and reduce decision making/task saturation of providers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Examples include handheld ultrasound technologies with automated data processing and pathology identification <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Technologies to support the prolonged care of combat casualties including differential thermal management, mitigating effects of prolonged immobilization, providing sufficient nutrition</p>\r\n<p><strong>Focus Area #2 - Battlefield Resuscitation and Immediate Stabilization of Combat Casualties (BRISCC):</strong> Hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable deaths among combat casualties occurring before a medical treatment facility is reached. The BRISCC portfolio seeks to provide materiel and knowledge solutions to enable the immediate stabilization at the point of injury. Current strategic objectives are to provide: (1) technologies to control bleeding in the pre-hospital environment, (2) safer, more effective, and more logistically supportable blood products, and (3) technologies and knowledge sets for improved damage control resuscitation.<br />Specific BRISCC areas of interest:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; New and innovative capabilities to stop non-compressible intra-cavitary hemorrhage and improved technologies to stop junctional and pelvic bleeding<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Innovative damage control resuscitation and damage control surgery technologies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Novel capabilities to treat injury patterns in projected future MDO including high-power projectiles, cavitating projectiles, fragmentary projectiles, crush injuries, smoke and debris inhalation, and thermobaric weapons <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Capabilities that provide early detection and treatment for the coagulopathy of trauma<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Capabilities that provide early detection of hemodynamic decompensation well before decompensation occurs to enable early intervention.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Efforts to effectively model the complex pathophysiology of trauma (including immunomodulatory effects) to enable future automated and semi-automated decision support algorithms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; New and novel clinical diagnostics (light and rugged) for point of injury assessment of hemorrhage and coagulopathy (for both internal and external bleeding)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Focus Area #3 - Neurotrauma &amp; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):</strong> The Neurotrauma Portfolio (NTP) is focused on closing military-relevant gaps across a broad range of research areas to improve the prevention, diagnosis, management, and treatment of TBI and related sequelae from point-of-injury through recovery. The NTP's goal is to decrease morbidity and mortality from neurotrauma, mitigate secondary brain injury across all TBI severities, and advance materiel and knowledge development to expand and develop new clinical practice guidelines, care algorithms, therapies, devices, and procedures that advance the decision-making capabilities of medical personnel, enabling earlier intervention and improved outcomes.<br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> For studies proposing animal research, provide justification for the use of non-gyrencephalic (lissencephalic) models of TBI.<br /><br />Specific NTP areas of interest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Identify expedient interventions to reduce incidence and severity of secondary brain injury<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Develop capabilities for the rapid triage and management of life-threatening TBI<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Identify novel approaches to moderate and severe TBI intervention and stabilization (e.g. maintain glucose levels, brain oxygenation, and cerebral blood flow)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Identify novel field expedient diagnostic capabilities (e.g., imaging, but does not require extensive interpretation by medical providers and reduces decision making/task saturation of providers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Identify novel approaches to resuscitate and treat hemorrhagic patients with severe TBI <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Identify novel field expedient fluid-based biomarkers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Develop field applicable treatments for post traumatic central nervous system (CNS) tissue preservation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Provide innovative solutions to sustain patients with TBI when evacuation is delayed (e.g., automated burr-holes devices, intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, etc.)</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Potential Funding Availability<br /></span></strong>The U.S. Government (USG) currently has available approximately $10 million (M) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. <br />MTEC anticipates that 4 (or more) awards of up to $2.5M each (direct and indirect costs), totaling $10M, will be made to qualified teams. The maximum request for Government funding for each white paper should not exceed $2.5M.
