If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov), or any other 3rd party provider, attachments may not be available or viewable to you.

This is a pre-solicitation public announcement a solicitation for proposals will follow this with due dates for proposals.  
Background:  Runway Status Lights System Description
Concept of Operations:  Runway Status Lights is an essential FAA system which uses Airport Surface Surveillance data to determine vehicle and aircraft locations. Runway Status Lights processes this data using complex software algorithms with adjustable parameters to control airfield lights in accordance with Air Traffic operations, including anticipated separation. Red airfield lights (Runway Entrance Lights and Takeoff Hold Lights) illuminate and extinguish as vehicles and aircraft traverse the airfield.
System:  Runway Status Lights integrates airport lighting equipment with approach and surface surveillance systems to provide a visual signal to pilots and vehicle operators indicating that it is unsafe to enter/cross or begin takeoff on runway. The system is fully automated based on inputs from surface and terminal surveillance systems. Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), with a size standard of $38.5M.

The current qualified source(s) are ADB Safegate (CAGE 5ED70) and Saab Sensis (CAGE 6ZQN9). The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

A Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached to this pre-solicitation synopsis.
The proposed requirement will be solicited under full and open competition, with multiple awards anticipated, and one or more awards reserved for small business if one or more small business prime contractors are found to represent best value to the Government in terms of both technical capability and price/cost reasonableness. The market research survey for this procurement, SSC-Pacific_MKTSVY_13F88E, was published on E- Commerce and FBO.gov on 03 August 2017. The SSC Pacific Small Business Office (SBO) concurred with the acquisition strategy decision on 07 September 2017.
The anticipated action will include multiple Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) type contracts.  The prospective contracts will have a six year ordering period. The estimated level-of-effort is 174,720 labor hours per year with an estimated total dollar value of $95,000,000. Awardees of contracts under this solicitation will compete for orders pursuant to the ordering process at FAR 16.505(b). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 Engineering Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $38.5M. Security classification will vary from Unclassified to SECRET classification.  This is a new requirement.
It is currently anticipated that RFP N66001-17-R-0154 will be released in December 2017. The solicitation will only be available electronically. Electronic copies of the RFP may be obtained from the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil under SSC Pacific "Open Solicitations." Hard copy versions of the RFP and any subsequent amendments will not be available. Firms are encouraged to review the website regularly for important solicitation information.SUBJECT DAI A2R Support Services<p>Synopsis for DAI A2R Support Services is hereby posted.&nbsp; Please see attached synopsis for details.&nbsp; Please note RFP will be released at a later date.</p>SUBJECT ENGINEERING AND INTEGRATION WORK FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE RESEARCH RACK (MSRR), MICROGRAVITY SCIENCE GLOVEBOX  (MSG), LIFE SCIENCE GLOVEBOX (LSG),  AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SERVIR ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND VISUALIZATION (ISERV) SYSTEM PATHFINDERNASA/MSFC has a requirement for engineering and integration work for the Materials Science Research Rack (MSRR), the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG), the Life Science Glovebox (LSG),and the International Space Station (ISS) SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization System (ISERV) Pathfinder.<br />&nbsp;
<p>NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. (TBE). NASA intends to continue the sustaining engineering and integration work for MSRR, MSG,&nbsp;LSG, and ISERV currently provided under the Engineering and Integration Work for Materials Science Research Rack (MSRR), Microgravity Science Research Glovebox (MSG) and International Space Station SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization (ISERV) Pathfinder delivery order NNM14AB60D issued against IDIQ contract NNM13A35C with TBE.</p>
<p>In order to replace MSRR, MSG, LSG, and ISERV work currently being performed under TBE's SDOS contract with a new business entity in this environment will require an estimated $1.1 million in duplicated cost to the Government to bring the new contractor up to speed with the flight hardware being developed, as well as the ground and flight operating hardware. This cost would not be expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>Competition is impractical for the following reasons:</p>
<p>A. TBE designed the MSRR in collaboration with NASA. They also developed, built and delivered significant components of the MSRR. The knowledge base constructed by TBE during the design and build phase and over he years of sustaining engineering under both the Syste3ms Development and Operations Support (SDOS/NAS8-02060) and ESP delivery order cannot be quickly replicated elsewhere. TBE has managed and conducted all activities related to the manufacture, assembly, verification, and test for the MSRR project. This has encompassed the development, fabrication, assembly, verification, and test activities of the various items constituting the MSRR Experiment Carrier (EC) and its direct interfaces.</p>
<p>B. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has worked very closely with the business entity that produced the MSG. &nbsp;The Video Upgrade Equipment (VUE) was an MSG facility upgrade launched on SpaceX-4 in September 2014. The VUE hardware experienced a radiation-induced failure of the solid-state memory drives that was first noticed on August 3, 2016. The MSG VUE is currently being redesigned to reduce the likelihood of this issue reoccurring. MSG hardware is currently operative aboard the ISS and any perturbation in project flow will directly disturb the flow of science coming from the ISS program.</p>
<p>C. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has worked very closely with the business entity that performed all the analytical integration work for the MSRR's MSL. The combination of knowledge between TBE and that business entity gives MSFC full corporate knowledge of the MSRR/MSL.</p>
<p>D. TBE is integral to the development of the hardware, as well as the development of the documentation necessary to install and operate the Life Science Glovebox (LSG). In addition to the duplicative costs that would be incurred, changing to a new contractor could negatively impact the facility's readiness for launch on H-II Transfer Vehicle-7 &nbsp;(HTV-7 )and the time needed to install and activate the rack on-orbit. The presence of LSG on-orbit is greatly needed by the ISS Program to ease the investigation workload on the MSG. It should be noted that at present, LSG can only be launched on an HTV, and HTV launches are very infrequent (on the order of once every 9-12 months). If the HTV-7 launch window is missed, significant time will be lost and additional costs will be incurred.</p>
<p>E. The new MSFC Sample Cartridge Development (SCA) design has been developed using a TBE design from a previous project. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has manufactured and integrated the thermal probe SCAs that are used for thermal development testing as well as other hardware to be used during the flight SCA development and qualification campaigns. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has manufactured many of the parts that make up the SCAs and has procured long-lead items that are required for the SCA project to remain on schedule.</p>
<p>F. TBE, under ESP and SDOS and in collaboration with MSFC, designed, built, tested, delivered, and supported the operation of of ISERV. ISERV was launched on HTV-3 in July 2012 and was removed from the Window Observational Research Facility&nbsp;(WORF) in December 2014 after experiencing an on-orbit anomaly.&nbsp; Currently the&nbsp; feasibility of using the ISERV hardware is being assessed. &nbsp;ISERV flight and ground software are unique applications that are critical for successful operations of the ISERV Pathfinder. As the sole developer of this software and with the in-depth knowledge of the ISERV instrument, TBE possesses the critical experience necessary to refurbish or upgrade ISERV.</p>
<p>G. Only TBE has the required skill set to allow the current sustaining engineering and integration work to continue on schedule. Proceeding with TBE allows science from the ISS to continue unabated through the timeframe when the U.S. Government will be reviewing the efficacy of the ISS Program in order to determine whether the life of the ISS should be extended into 2028.</p>
