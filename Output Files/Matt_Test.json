Runway Status Lights processes this data using complex software algorithms with adjustable parameters to control airfield lights in accordance with Air Traffic operations, including anticipated separation. Red airfield lights (Runway Entrance Lights and Takeoff Hold Lights) illuminate and extinguish as vehicles and aircraft traverse the airfield.\nSystem:  Runway Status Lights integrates airport lighting equipment with approach and surface surveillance systems to provide a visual signal to pilots and vehicle operators indicating that it is unsafe to enter/cross or begin takeoff on runway. The system is fully automated based on inputs from surface and terminal surveillance systems. Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway.\n\nThe principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), with a size standard of $38.5M.\n\nThe current qualified source(s) are ADB Safegate (CAGE 5ED70) and Saab Sensis (CAGE 6ZQN9). The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you're viewing this announcement from a source other than Federal Aviation Administration Contract Opportunities (FAACO), visit https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm/announcement/view/28521 to view the original announcement.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOT/FAA/MMACTR/6973GH-18-R-00016/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"stacey.stanley@faa.gov","DESC3":"Click here to email Stacey Stanley","SETASIDE":"N/A"}}],[{"PRESOL":{"DATE":"1121","YEAR":"17","AGENCY":"Department of Energy","OFFICE":"Federal Locations","LOCATION":"All DOE Federal Contracting Offices","ZIP":"37831","CLASSCOD":"R","NAICS":"541612","OFFADD":"Oak Ridge<br />U.S. Department of Energy<br />P.O.

The suspension systems that satisfy all of the requirements below may be evaluated via modeling and simulation, and have the potential to be purchased and tested in a lab or on a Bradley vehicle of the Governments choosing. Emphasis should be placed on ready to field, low cost solutions that have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or higher currently.</p>\r\n<p>The suspension systems must be applicable and adaptable to the military environment. This environment includes extreme ambient operating conditions from -40&deg;C to 60&deg;C (-40&deg; to 140&deg; Fahrenheit), storage conditions of -51&deg;C to 71&deg;C (-60&deg; to 160&deg; Fahrenheit), as well as extreme shock and vibration outlined in MIL-STD-810. Both our soldiers and vehicle components must be capable of operating effectively within this environment. <br /><br />TARDEC is requesting information on proven suspension system technologies for the conversion of torsion bar suspensions to external spring and damper configurations, which are to include squat capability. The Government is looking for technologies that require little to no changes to the vehicle to integrate, and that can be purchased now or quickly modified and purchased within 6 months, using existing manufacturing processes if possible, for this request. If vehicle modifications are required, please specify the required changes, the amount of time, and level of effort needed to make the system effective.</p>\r\n<p>Responders to this survey should clearly and briefly address the topic category as well as address the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION requested below.</p>\r\n<p>QUESTIONS:</p>\r\n<p>Proven external spring and damping technologies</p>\r\n<p>Objectives: - To evaluate and analyze proven spring and damping system technologies that could be used to convert Bradley vehicles from internal torsion bar and external linear dampers to external spring and damper solutions.

The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as \"CONFIDENTIAL\" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>\r\n<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) \"PROPRIETARY\" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as \"PROPRIETARY\" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected<br />3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data, <br />4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:\" and \"PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS\". <br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br />6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as \"PROPRIETARY\" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br />Instructions to Offeror</p>\r\n<p><br />Complete the matrix for the specification with the following instructions for each column.

(TBE). NASA intends to continue the sustaining engineering and integration work for MSRR, MSG,&nbsp;LSG, and ISERV currently provided under the Engineering and Integration Work for Materials Science Research Rack (MSRR), Microgravity Science Research Glovebox (MSG) and International Space Station SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization (ISERV) Pathfinder delivery order NNM14AB60D issued against IDIQ contract NNM13A35C with TBE.</p>\r\n<p>In order to replace MSRR, MSG, LSG, and ISERV work currently being performed under TBE's SDOS contract with a new business entity in this environment will require an estimated $1.1 million in duplicated cost to the Government to bring the new contractor up to speed with the flight hardware being developed, as well as the ground and flight operating hardware. This cost would not be expected to be recovered through competition.</p>\r\n<p>Competition is impractical for the following reasons:</p>\r\n<p>A. TBE designed the MSRR in collaboration with NASA. They also developed, built and delivered significant components of the MSRR. The knowledge base constructed by TBE during the design and build phase and over he years of sustaining engineering under both the Syste3ms Development and Operations Support (SDOS/NAS8-02060) and ESP delivery order cannot be quickly replicated elsewhere. TBE has managed and conducted all activities related to the manufacture, assembly, verification, and test for the MSRR project. This has encompassed the development, fabrication, assembly, verification, and test activities of the various items constituting the MSRR Experiment Carrier (EC) and its direct interfaces.</p>\r\n<p>B. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has worked very closely with the business entity that produced the MSG. &nbsp;The Video Upgrade Equipment (VUE) was an MSG facility upgrade launched on SpaceX-4 in September 2014. The VUE hardware experienced a radiation-induced failure of the solid-state memory drives that was first noticed on August 3, 2016. The MSG VUE is currently being redesigned to reduce the likelihood of this issue reoccurring. MSG hardware is currently operative aboard the ISS and any perturbation in project flow will directly disturb the flow of science coming from the ISS program.</p>\r\n<p>C. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has worked very closely with the business entity that performed all the analytical integration work for the MSRR's MSL. The combination of knowledge between TBE and that business entity gives MSFC full corporate knowledge of the MSRR/MSL.</p>\r\n<p>D. TBE is integral to the development of the hardware, as well as the development of the documentation necessary to install and operate the Life Science Glovebox (LSG). In addition to the duplicative costs that would be incurred, changing to a new contractor could negatively impact the facility's readiness for launch on H-II Transfer Vehicle-7 &nbsp;(HTV-7 )and the time needed to install and activate the rack on-orbit. The presence of LSG on-orbit is greatly needed by the ISS Program to ease the investigation workload on the MSG. It should be noted that at present, LSG can only be launched on an HTV, and HTV launches are very infrequent (on the order of once every 9-12 months). If the HTV-7 launch window is missed, significant time will be lost and additional costs will be incurred.</p>\r\n<p>E. The new MSFC Sample Cartridge Development (SCA) design has been developed using a TBE design from a previous project. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has manufactured and integrated the thermal probe SCAs that are used for thermal development testing as well as other hardware to be used during the flight SCA development and qualification campaigns. TBE, under ESP and SDOS, has manufactured many of the parts that make up the SCAs and has procured long-lead items that are required for the SCA project to remain on schedule.</p>\r\n<p>F. TBE, under ESP and SDOS and in collaboration with MSFC, designed, built, tested, delivered, and supported the operation of of ISERV. ISERV was launched on HTV-3 in July 2012 and was removed from the Window Observational Research Facility&nbsp;(WORF) in December 2014 after experiencing an on-orbit anomaly.&nbsp; Currently the&nbsp; feasibility of using the ISERV hardware is being assessed. &nbsp;ISERV flight and ground software are unique applications that are critical for successful operations of the ISERV Pathfinder. As the sole developer of this software and with the in-depth knowledge of the ISERV instrument, TBE possesses the critical experience necessary to refurbish or upgrade ISERV.</p>\r\n<p>G. Only TBE has the required skill set to allow the current sustaining engineering and integration work to continue on schedule. Proceeding with TBE allows science from the ISS to continue unabated through the timeframe when the U.S. Government will be reviewing the efficacy of the ISS Program in order to determine whether the life of the ISS should be extended into 2028.</p>\r\n<p><br />The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>\r\n<p><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>\r\n<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on 12/7/2017.

The suspension systems that satisfy all of the requirements below may be evaluated via modeling and simulation, and have the potential to be purchased and tested in a lab or on a Bradley vehicle of the Governments choosing. Emphasis should be placed on ready to field, low cost solutions that have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or higher currently.</p>\r\n<p>The suspension systems must be applicable and adaptable to the military environment. This environment includes extreme ambient operating conditions from -40&deg;C to 60&deg;C (-40&deg; to 140&deg; Fahrenheit), storage conditions of -51&deg;C to 71&deg;C (-60&deg; to 160&deg; Fahrenheit), as well as extreme shock and vibration outlined in MIL-STD-810. Both our soldiers and vehicle components must be capable of operating effectively within this environment. <br /><br />TARDEC is requesting information on proven suspension system technologies for the conversion of torsion bar suspensions to external spring and damper configurations, which are to include squat capability. The Government is looking for technologies that require little to no changes to the vehicle to integrate, and that can be purchased now or quickly modified and purchased within 6 months, using existing manufacturing processes if possible, for this request. If vehicle modifications are required, please specify the required changes, the amount of time, and level of effort needed to make the system effective.</p>\r\n<p>Responders to this survey should clearly and briefly address the topic category as well as address the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION requested below.</p>\r\n<p>QUESTIONS:</p>\r\n<p>Proven external spring and damping technologies</p>\r\n<p>Objectives: - To evaluate and analyze proven spring and damping system technologies that could be used to convert Bradley vehicles from internal torsion bar and external linear dampers to external spring and damper solutions. These technologies are to include squat capability of greater than 5 inches from normal ride height.</p>\r\n<p>Responders to this market survey should clearly and briefly address:<br /><br />&bull; Proven spring and damping technologies <br />&bull; Describe available solutions.<br />&bull; Describe the mechanisms involved in vehicle squat and return. <br />&bull; Provide any test or analysis results/reports quantifying off-road mobility, safety, and durability of existing systems within the range of the Bradley vehicle weight, weight distribution, and center of gravity locations of the current Bradley fleet (90,000 lbs. or 45 US tons)<br />&bull; Describe any additional work/modifications required to implement if it's not a direct one for one swap/replacement. <br />&bull; Approximate cost for a vehicle kit.</p>\r\n<p><br />Does your company have currently developed external spring and damping system technology, with squat capability, which can be integrated onto existing Bradley vehicles with weight of 90,000 lbs. or 45 US tons, with a total required average per-station component weight of less than 463 lbs. for twelve stations?</p>\r\n<p>Does your company currently have an external suspension system technology demonstration Bradley-like vehicle that you have already integrated your technology into?</p>\r\n<p>Notes: The overall goal of this investigation is to find existing technology that can be employed or slightly modified to achieve the goals of improving system survivability through the elimination of torsion bars, and improving air and rail transportability through the provision of a squatting function. Further, the designs and materials must be suitable to: <br />i. Remove of all torsion bars<br />ii. Provide squat capability<br />iii. Have a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) of 3 without additional testing or development.<br />iv. Not add to overall vehicle weight<br />v. Not require the addition of any vehicle internal equipment, e.g., hydraulics, nitrogen systems, etc.<br />vi. Have an estimated cost of replacement equipment below $85,000<br />vii. Meet or exceed all current Bradley performance requirements<br />viii. Field installation and repair of any investigated suspension system options is desired.<br />ix. All suspension system options must be compatible with the current T-161 Bradley track system, with lightweight track pins and roadwheels<br />x. A desired life of the suspension hardware is greater than 5000 miles<br />xi. Current Bradley suspension physical relationships are:<br />a. Roadarm to damper motion ratio is 1.2:1<br />b. Center of gravity location is 51 inches aft of center of sprocket and 1.3 inches right of center<br />c.

The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as \"CONFIDENTIAL\" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>\r\n<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) \"PROPRIETARY\" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as \"PROPRIETARY\" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected<br />3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data, <br />4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:\" and \"PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS\". <br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br />6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as \"PROPRIETARY\" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br />Instructions to Offeror</p>\r\n<p><br />Complete the matrix for the specification with the following instructions for each column.
